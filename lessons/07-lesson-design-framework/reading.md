# The Architecture of a Lesson

Think about a building. Before anyone lays a single brick, an architect creates blueprints. These drawings show every room, every doorway, every window. The builder doesn't improvise. The architect has already decided where everything goes.

Teaching works the same way. Before a teacher stands in front of a class, they create a blueprint. In our program, that blueprint has five parts. We call them artifacts, and each one serves a specific purpose.

The first artifact is the **lesson plan**. This document is for administrators, not students. When Ms. Knight wants to know what's happening in our classroom, she reads the lesson plan. It lists the learning objectives, the standards we're addressing, the materials we need, and exactly how we'll spend our time. The lesson plan proves we've thought through every minute.

The second artifact is the **presentation slides**. These are what you see on the screen during direct instruction. Good slides don't have walls of text. They have key ideas, images, and just enough words to guide attention. The slides keep the lesson moving and give students something to look at while they listen.

The third artifact is the **reading**. This is what I'm doing right now: reading aloud while you follow along. The reading provides core content in a format everyone can access. Some students learn better by listening. Some learn better by reading. When I read aloud while you follow on screen, both groups get what they need.

The fourth artifact is the **worksheet**. In our class, worksheets aren't fill-in-the-blank busywork. They're discussion prompts. You read the prompts on your device, talk with your group, and I walk around to listen, ask questions, and push your thinking. The worksheet structures conversation without controlling it.

The fifth artifact is the **quiz**. This comes at the end, through Google Classroom. The quiz tells me what you understood and what I need to revisit. It's not a gotcha. It's a signal. If half the class misses the same question, that's my cue to teach that concept differently next time.

Here's what matters: these five artifacts work together. The slides support the reading. The reading prepares you for the discussion. The discussion deepens your understanding. The quiz measures whether it all worked. Remove one piece, and the whole system weakens.

Soon, you'll create one of these artifacts yourself. I'll give you three or four pieces of a lesson, and you'll build the missing piece. Maybe you'll write the slides. Maybe you'll design the quiz. Maybe you'll craft discussion prompts. By building part of a lesson, you'll understand how lessons work from the inside.
