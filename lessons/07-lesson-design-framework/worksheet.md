# Group Discussion: The Five Artifacts of Lesson Design

Read each prompt with your group. Discuss your ideas verbally. Summarize your key points on paper.

## Prompt 1: The Lesson Plan's Audience

The lesson plan is written for administrators, not students. Why does this matter? Think about how you would describe a lesson to your principal versus how you would explain it to a friend. What information does an administrator need that students don't? What would happen if a teacher had no lesson plan at all?

## Prompt 2: Slides That Help vs. Slides That Hurt

We've all sat through presentations with too much text on every slide. Why do you think teachers (and others) make slides like that? What makes a slide actually helpful for learning? If you were creating slides for a lesson on a topic you know well, what would you put on each slide and what would you leave out?

## Prompt 3: The Power of Reading Aloud

In our class, the instructor reads aloud while students follow along on screen. Some classes just give students a handout to read silently. What are the advantages of the read-aloud approach? Are there any disadvantages? When you become a teacher, how might you decide when to read aloud and when to let students read independently?

## Prompt 4: Discussion vs. Fill-in-the-Blank

Our worksheets are discussion prompts, not fill-in-the-blank exercises. Think about your own experience with both types. Which one requires more thinking? Which one is easier to "fake" completing? Why do you think discussion prompts work better for learning, even though they're harder to grade?

## Prompt 5: The Quiz as a Signal

The reading said the quiz is "not a gotcha—it's a signal." What does this mean? How should a teacher respond if half the class misses the same quiz question? How is this different from thinking students just didn't study? What does this perspective suggest about the purpose of assessment?

## Prompt 6: Creating One Piece of the Puzzle

Soon you'll create one artifact for a lesson package. Which artifact would you most want to create: slides, reading, worksheet, or quiz? Why? Which would be most challenging for you? What would you need to know about the other artifacts before you could create your piece?
