## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Identify and describe the five artifacts that comprise a complete lesson package
2. Explain the purpose and audience for each artifact
3. Describe the technology tools used to create and deliver each artifact
4. Understand how they will contribute to lesson creation in future assignments

## Standards Alignment

**Texas TEKS - Instructional Practices (Education and Training Career Cluster):**

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 5 | **The student understands instructional planning and delivery.** Students explore the components of effective lesson design, including objectives, materials, instructional sequence, and assessment strategies. |
| 130.123(c)(4) | **The student uses technology tools to enhance learning.** Students identify and describe technology tools (Google Slides, Docs, Forms, Classroom) used in lesson creation and delivery. |
| 3(C) | **The student explores the teaching profession.** Students examine the professional responsibilities of teachers, including lesson planning and documentation for administrators. |

**Connection to Educator Preparation:**
- Introduces the lesson planning framework students will use throughout the program
- Prepares students for hands-on lesson creation assignments
- Models the connection between planning, delivery, and assessment
- Demonstrates professional documentation practices

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
**0:00 - 0:05**
- Welcome students and introduce the topic: "The Five Artifacts of Effective Lesson Design"
- Ask: "What do you think a teacher needs to prepare before teaching a lesson?" (brief responses)
- Present learning objectives
- Frame the lesson: "Today you'll learn about the framework we use to design lessons in this class. Soon, you'll be creating parts of lessons yourselves."

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
**0:05 - 0:15**
- Present slides covering:
  - The five artifacts and their purposes
  - The technology tools for each artifact
  - How the artifacts work together during a lesson
  - What makes each artifact effective
- Read aloud the reading passage while students follow along on screen
- Pause briefly after the reading to check for understanding

### Guided Practice - Group Discussion (15 minutes)
**0:15 - 0:30**
- Organize students into groups of 3-4
- Direct students to access the worksheet on their devices
- Explain instructions: discuss prompts verbally, summarize key points on paper
- Circulate among groups to:
  - Listen to conversations and ask follow-up questions
  - Provide scaffolding: "Why do you think that artifact matters?" or "What would happen if it was missing?"
  - Redirect if discussions go off-topic
  - Encourage quieter students to share their thinking
- At 0:28, give a 2-minute warning to wrap up discussions

### Closure (5 minutes)
**0:30 - 0:35**
- Bring class back together
- Invite 2-3 groups to share one key insight from their discussion
- Summarize main takeaways:
  - Five artifacts work together as a system
  - Each serves a specific purpose and audience
  - Good lessons require preparation AND flexibility
  - You will soon create one artifact as part of a lesson package
- Preview upcoming assignment: "In future lessons, I'll provide you with three or four artifacts, and you'll create the missing piece."
- Transition to assessment

### Assessment (5-8 minutes)
**0:35 - 0:40**
- Direct students to Google Classroom to complete the quiz individually
- Remind students: questions are randomized, no retakes, answers not shown at end
- Remain available for technical questions

## Differentiation Strategies

**For students needing additional support:**
- Pair with supportive peer during group discussion
- Provide sentence starters: "The purpose of [artifact] is..." or "This artifact helps the teacher..."
- During circulation, spend extra time with these groups to clarify concepts
- Allow verbal summary to instructor instead of written notes if needed

**For advanced students:**
- Assign discussion facilitator role within their group
- Pose extension questions: "How might you modify these artifacts for different grade levels?"
- Challenge them to identify connections between artifacts (how does the reading inform the quiz?)

---

## Assessment

**Formative Assessment:**
- Observation during group discussions (engagement, quality of ideas, peer collaboration)
- Questions asked during instructor circulation
- Group summary notes (collected optionally)

**Summative Assessment:**
- Google Classroom quiz: 8 multiple choice and true/false questions
- Automatically graded; results available for instructor review
- Quiz data informs whether concepts need reinforcement in future lessons
