## Slide 5: Artifact 1 - The Lesson Plan
1. Learning objectives: What students will know or do

## Slide 6: Artifact 2 - The Slides (Comparison)
**Effective Slides:**
- Key ideas, not paragraphs
- Images that support content
- Guide attention, don't overwhelm

**Ineffective Slides:**
- Walls of text to read verbatim
- Clip art that adds nothing
- Everything crammed on one slide

---

## Slide 7: Artifact 3 - The Reading
Instructor reads aloud.
Students follow along.
Listeners AND readers both get what they need.

---

## Slide 8: Artifact 4 - The Worksheet (Comparison)
**Our Worksheets:**
- Discussion prompts
- Talk with your group
- Instructor circulates and engages

**Traditional Worksheets:**
- Fill-in-the-blank
- Work silently alone
- Collect and grade later

---

## Slide 9: Artifact 5 - The Quiz
- Delivered through Google Classroom
- Questions are randomized
- Immediate feedback to instructor
- Not a gotcha - a signal for what to reteach

---

## Slide 10: The System
Slides support the reading.
Reading prepares discussion.
Discussion deepens understanding.
Quiz measures if it worked.

Remove one piece, the whole system weakens.

---

## Slide 11: Your Future Assignment
- I provide three or four artifacts
- You create the missing piece
- Maybe: slides, reading, worksheet, or quiz
- By building part, you understand the whole

---

## Slide 12: Group Discussion Instructions
- Read prompts on your device
- Discuss verbally with your group
- Summarize key points on paper
- I'll visit each group

---

## Slide 13: Closing
"A lesson is a system. Every piece serves the whole."
