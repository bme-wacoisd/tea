## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Describe a student sitting quietly at their desk. Ask: "Is this student engaged?"
- Collect responses—introduce the compliance vs. engagement distinction
- Frame: A quiet classroom isn't necessarily a learning classroom

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Define engagement vs. compliance
- Present three types of engagement:
  - Behavioral: What students DO (observable)
  - Cognitive: How students THINK (internal)
  - Emotional: How students FEEL (foundational)
- Discuss signs of engaged vs. compliant vs. disengaged students
- Present engagement-boosting factors:
  - Relevance
  - Appropriate challenge
  - Autonomy
  - Relationships
  - Active processing

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the signs of engagement vs. compliance

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Brainstorm responses to "This is boring"
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share strategies for increasing engagement
- Discuss the technology and engagement question
- Address the "appropriate challenge" balance

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Compliance isn't engagement—aim for minds, not just bodies
- Create conditions for genuine investment: relevance, challenge, autonomy, relationships
- Challenge: In your next observation, look for signs of engagement vs. compliance

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of engagement strategies; understanding of three types
- **Summative**: Quiz on engagement concepts and factors

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide engagement factors reference card
- **For advanced students**: Research flow theory or self-determination theory
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (engagement, compliance, cognitive, autonomy)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson connects to students' own experiences—they know what it feels like to be engaged vs. going through the motions. Draw on that experience to make concepts concrete.

The compliance vs. engagement distinction is powerful. Many students have experienced teachers who confused quiet with learning. Help them see the difference.

Key insight: Engagement isn't just about making things fun. It's about creating conditions where students genuinely invest mental effort. This sometimes means productive struggle, not entertainment.

The technology discussion is increasingly relevant. Tools designed to reduce friction or make tasks easier might actually reduce the engagement that produces learning. AI tools that do the thinking for students may hurt more than help.

Connect to their future classrooms: How will they know if students are engaged? What will they do when students are compliant but not truly engaged?
