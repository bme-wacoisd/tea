# Engagement

Keeping Students in the Learning Zone

---

## The Question

A student sits quietly at their desk, pencil in hand, eyes on the board.

Are they engaged?

Maybe. Or maybe they're daydreaming, anxious, or checked out.

Speaker notes: Compliance and engagement look different inside.

---

## Compliance vs. Engagement

**Compliance**: Following directions without mental investment
- Present in body

**Engagement**: Actively invested in learning
- Present in mind

A quiet classroom isn't necessarily a learning classroom.

Speaker notes: The goal is mental investment, not just behavior.

## Three Types of Engagement

| Type | Focus | Observable? |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Behavioral | What students DO | Yes |
| Cognitive | How students THINK | Hard to see |
| Emotional | How students FEEL | Sometimes |

Speaker notes: All three matter, but cognitive is where learning happens.

---

## Signs of Engagement

**Engaged**:
- Asking questions without prompting
- Discussing beyond requirements
- Persisting through difficulty
- Making connections to their lives
- Wanting to know more

Speaker notes: The engaged student wants to learn.

---

## Signs of Compliance (Not Engagement)

**Compliant but not engaged**:
- Doing minimum required
- Waiting for the bell
- Surface-level answers
- Quick to give up when challenged
- No questions

Speaker notes: The compliant student wants class to end.

## What Increases Engagement

| Factor | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Relevance | Students see why it matters |
| Appropriate Challenge | Not too easy, not too hard |
| Autonomy | Some control over learning |
| Relationships | Feeling known and valued |
| Active Processing | Doing, not just receiving |

Speaker notes: Design for these conditions.

## The Challenge Zone

**Too Easy** → Boredom → Disengagement

**Just Right** → Flow → Deep Learning

**Too Hard** → Frustration → Giving Up

Speaker notes: Differentiate to keep students in the zone.

---

## Active Processing

Learning BY doing beats learning BY receiving:
- Discussions and debates
- Problem-solving
- Creating products
- Teaching others

Passive reception rarely produces deep learning.

Speaker notes: Make students the workers, not the audience.

---

## Technology and Engagement

Technology can increase OR decrease engagement:

**Increases**: Interactive, collaborative, creative, choice-enabling

**Decreases**: Passive consumption, distraction, substitution for thinking

Ask: Does this technology increase cognitive engagement?

Speaker notes: Easier isn't always better for learning.

---

## Closing

Compliance isn't engagement. Aim for minds, not just bodies.

Create conditions for genuine investment: relevance, challenge, autonomy, relationships.

Speaker notes: When students are truly engaged, learning follows.
