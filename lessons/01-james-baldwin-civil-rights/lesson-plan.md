## Standards Alignment

**Texas TEKS - Instructional Practices (Education and Training Career Cluster):**

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 4 | **The student understands the learner and the learning process.** Demonstrate techniques for development of effective relationships with students that foster mutual respect and rapport and result in effective instruction. |
| 5 | **The student understands instructional planning and delivery.** Present subject matter effectively, including selecting and using a variety of instructional strategies to promote student success. |
| 7 | **The student creates an effective learning environment.** Describe and implement a safe and effective learning environment; demonstrate teacher characteristics that promote effective learning. |

**Connection to Educator Preparation:**
- Develops skills for teaching sensitive historical content appropriately across grade levels
- Models differentiation strategies (adjusting complexity, not importance, by age)
- Demonstrates discussion-based approaches to inclusive classroom conversation
- Shows how to use personal stories and present-day connections to make content accessible

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
**0:00 - 0:05**
- Welcome students and introduce the topic: "Teaching Civil Rights Through James Baldwin"
- Ask: "Has anyone heard of James Baldwin before?" (brief responses)
- Present learning objectives
- Frame the lesson: "As future teachers, you'll teach students ranging from pre-K to high school. Today we'll explore how to teach civil rights across all those grade levels."

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
**0:05 - 0:15**
- Present slides covering:
  - Who James Baldwin was and why his words matter for teaching
  - The challenge of teaching civil rights
  - Key strategies: age-appropriate entry points, questioning, personal stories, present-day connections
- Read aloud the reading passage while students follow along on screen
- Pause briefly after the reading to check for understanding

### Guided Practice - Group Discussion (15 minutes)
**0:15 - 0:30**
- Organize students into groups of 3-4
- Direct students to access the worksheet on their devices
- Explain instructions: discuss prompts verbally, summarize key points on paper
- Circulate among groups to:
  - Listen to conversations and ask follow-up questions
  - Provide scaffolding: "What makes you say that?" or "How might that work with younger students?"
  - Redirect if discussions go off-topic
  - Encourage quieter students to share their thinking
- At 0:28, give a 2-minute warning to wrap up discussions

### Closure (5 minutes)
**0:30 - 0:35**
- Bring class back together
- Invite 2-3 groups to share one key insight from their discussion
- Summarize main takeaways:
  - Civil rights can and should be taught at every grade level
  - Adjust complexity, not importance
  - Baldwin's approach: connect history to human experience
  - Create safe spaces for honest conversation
- Transition to assessment

### Assessment (5-8 minutes)
**0:35 - 0:40**
- Direct students to Google Classroom to complete the quiz individually
- Remind students: questions are randomized, no retakes, answers not shown at end
- Remain available for technical questions

## Differentiation Strategies

**For students needing additional support:**
- Pair with supportive peer during group discussion
- Provide sentence starters for discussion: "One strategy I would use is..." or "I think younger students would respond to..."
- During circulation, spend extra time with these groups to model discussion
- Allow verbal summary to instructor instead of written notes if needed

**For advanced students:**
- Assign discussion facilitator role within their group
- Pose extension questions: "How might you assess whether your civil rights lesson was effective?"
- Challenge them to find connections between Baldwin's ideas and other educators or thinkers they've studied

---

## Assessment

**Formative Assessment:**
- Observation during group discussions (engagement, quality of ideas, peer collaboration)
- Questions asked during instructor circulation
- Group summary notes (collected optionally)

**Summative Assessment:**
- Google Classroom quiz: 8 multiple choice and true/false questions
- Automatically graded; results available for instructor review
- Quiz data informs whether concepts need reinforcement in future lessons
