## Prompt 1: Your Own Experience

Think about a time when you learned about civil rights or fairness—either in school or outside of school. What made that learning experience effective or memorable? What could have been better about how the topic was presented?

**Consider**: Was it a story, a discussion, a video, or something else? How did it make you feel?

## Prompt 2: Understanding Baldwin's Approach

James Baldwin said, "Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced." In your own words, what does this quote mean? How might you use this idea when teaching students about difficult topics in history?

**Consider**: Why might some teachers avoid "facing" hard topics? What are the risks of avoiding them?

## Prompt 3: Teaching Young Children

Imagine you are a first-grade teacher. You want to introduce the concept of fairness and treating everyone with respect—ideas at the heart of civil rights. What activity or lesson might you create? What words would you use? What would you avoid?

**Consider**: Young children understand fairness. How can you build on what they already know without overwhelming them?

## Prompt 4: Teaching Middle School Students

Now imagine you are teaching sixth graders. They can handle more complex information but may have strong emotional reactions to learning about injustice. How would you introduce a civil rights topic like school desegregation? What support would you provide for students who find it upsetting?

**Consider**: How do you balance honesty about history with emotional safety in the classroom?

---

## Prompt 5: Connecting Past to Present

Baldwin said that "history is not the past; it is the present." How would you help high school students connect civil rights history to issues they see in the world today? What current events or experiences might you discuss? What ground rules would you set for that conversation?

**Consider**: How do you facilitate discussion about current events without pushing a particular political view?

---

## Prompt 6: Your Teaching Identity

How do you think your own background and experiences will shape how you teach about civil rights? What strengths do you bring to this topic? What might you need to learn more about before teaching it?

**Consider**: Every teacher brings a unique perspective. How can your perspective be a resource for students?
