> "Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."
> — James Baldwin

**Teaching application:**

## Strategy 1: Age-Appropriate Entry Points

| Grade Level | Entry Point | Example Activity |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Pre-K to 2 | Fairness and kindness | "What makes a good friend to everyone?" |
| 3 to 5 | Rules that changed | Timeline of rights: then vs. now |
| 6 to 8 | Primary sources | Analyze Baldwin's letters or speeches |
| 9 to 12 | Complex analysis | Compare Baldwin's essays to current events |

Speaker notes: The same topic—civil rights—requires completely different approaches depending on age.

---

## Strategy 2: Start with Questions, Not Answers

**Instead of:** "The Civil Rights Movement was about..."

**Try:** "What do you think it means for everyone to be treated fairly?"

**Why this works:**
- Invites student thinking
- Honors what students already know
- Creates space for multiple perspectives
- Works at every grade level

Speaker notes: Model this questioning approach. Let students construct understanding.

---

## Strategy 3: Use Personal Stories

**Baldwin's approach:** He wrote about real experiences—his own and others'.

**In your classroom:**
- Share age-appropriate stories of real people
- Connect big historical events to individual lives
- Let students share their own experiences with fairness/unfairness

**Caution:** Be sensitive to students' backgrounds and experiences.

Speaker notes: Stories humanize history. Baldwin was a master storyteller.

---

## Strategy 4: Make Connections to Today

**Baldwin wrote:** "History is not the past. It is the present."

**Teaching application:**
- Help students see civil rights as ongoing
- Connect to age-appropriate current events
- Encourage students to see themselves as part of history

**For younger students:** "How do we make sure everyone is included on the playground?"

**For older students:** "How do Baldwin's observations apply to issues you see today?"

Speaker notes: This helps students understand why history matters.

## Adapting for Different Learners

**For students who need support:**
- Use visual aids and images
- Provide vocabulary support
- Pair with peer support during discussions
- Offer sentence starters

**For advanced students:**
- Provide original Baldwin texts
- Ask them to make cross-curricular connections
- Challenge them to teach younger students

Speaker notes: All students can engage with civil rights—adjust the complexity, not the importance.

---

## Classroom Environment Considerations

**Before teaching civil rights:**
- Establish classroom norms for respectful discussion
- Create a safe space for questions
- Acknowledge that these topics can bring up emotions
- Be prepared to pause and process

**Baldwin's reminder:** "Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without."

Speaker notes: The emotional safety of your classroom enables deeper learning.

## What NOT to Do

- Don't oversimplify to "good guys vs. bad guys"
- Don't make students feel responsible for historical wrongs
- Don't assume all students have the same background knowledge
- Don't avoid the topic because it's uncomfortable

**Remember:** Students are more capable of these conversations than we sometimes think.

Speaker notes: These are common pitfalls. Being aware helps you avoid them.

**Instructions:**
- Read each prompt on your computer
