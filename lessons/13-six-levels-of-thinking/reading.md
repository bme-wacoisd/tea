# Six Levels of Thinking

Benjamin Bloom was an educational psychologist at the University of Chicago who made a troubling discovery. When he analyzed thousands of test questions from schools across America, he found that most of them were asking students to do just one thing: remember facts. What year did the Civil War start? What is the capital of France? What are the three states of matter? Students were memorizing, regurgitating, and then forgetting—they weren't actually thinking. Bloom believed this was a waste of human potential. He was convinced that almost anyone could master almost anything, given the right conditions. But those conditions had to include questions that pushed students beyond mere recall.

Bloom's response was to create a taxonomy—a classification system—of thinking levels. At the bottom sits Remember: retrieving facts from memory. Above that is Understand: explaining what those facts mean. Then Apply: using knowledge in new situations. Then Analyze: breaking ideas apart to find relationships and patterns. Then Evaluate: making judgments about quality or value. And at the top, Create: producing something original. These six levels form a hierarchy because each builds on the ones below. You cannot analyze something you don't understand, and you cannot understand something you don't remember. But the goal is always to climb higher.

The trap most teachers fall into is the "What?" trap. It's easy to write "What is...?" questions. What is photosynthesis? What are the branches of government? What happened in chapter three? These questions feel like teaching because students have to know something to answer them. But they're all at the Remember level. They don't require students to think—only to recall. The solution isn't to abandon Remember questions entirely. You need them to activate prior knowledge and check that students have the foundation. But then you must climb the ladder: "Now that you know what photosynthesis is, why does it matter to animals?" That's Analyze. "Is the balance of powers working in America today?" That's Evaluate. "What would happen if the character had made a different choice?" That's Create.

Here's what the research shows: when students engage in higher-order thinking, they actually remember lower-order facts better. The student who analyzes why photosynthesis matters to animals will remember the definition of photosynthesis longer than the student who just memorized it. Deep thinking creates strong memories. This is why Bloom's taxonomy matters—not because higher-order thinking is "harder" in some abstract sense, but because it produces better learning at every level.

The practical application for future teachers is straightforward. First, audit your questions: when you plan a lesson, categorize each question by cognitive level. Are they all Remember? That's a problem. Second, plan questions at multiple levels deliberately. Start with Remember to activate knowledge, then climb. Third, match your assessments to your objectives. If your learning objective uses the verb "analyze," your test must require analysis—not just recall. The verb in your objective tells you what level of thinking you're demanding. If you only ask "What?" you will only get recall. Teach students to think by asking them to think.
