## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. List the six levels of Bloom's taxonomy in order from lowest to highest
2. Classify questions by their cognitive level (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
3. Transform lower-order questions into higher-order questions
4. Explain why matching assessment to objective matters

## Texas TEKS Alignment

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 5 | **The student understands instructional planning and delivery** - designing questions at multiple cognitive levels |
| 6 | **The student understands assessment and evaluation** - aligning assessment to learning objectives |

## Materials Needed

- Slides presentation (Google Slides)
- Reading handout or projected text
- Worksheet for group discussion
- Quiz (Google Forms)

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask students: "What kinds of questions do your teachers usually ask you?"
- Quick poll: How many questions start with "What is..."?
- Introduce Bloom's discovery about test questions

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Present Benjamin Bloom's background and research
- Introduce the six levels with definitions and question starters
- Explain the hierarchy (each level builds on the previous)
- Demonstrate the "What?" trap with examples
- Show how to transform questions to higher levels

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause to emphasize the retention paradox (higher-order thinking improves recall)

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Groups write questions at all six levels for one topic
- Instructor circulates to check question classifications

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share their question ladders
- Discuss challenges in writing higher-order questions
- Address the alignment principle (verb in objective = level of assessment)

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: If you only ask "What?" you only get recall
- Challenge: This week, classify the questions your teachers ask

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of questions generated during group work; accuracy of level classifications
- **Summative**: Quiz on Bloom's taxonomy levels and question classification

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide question stem cards for each level; work in pairs
- **For advanced students**: Analyze a real test and classify every question by level
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach key vocabulary (hierarchy, cognitive, taxonomy)

## Instructor Notes

Model the question ladder during instruction—don't just describe it. Start with a Remember question, then climb through each level so students experience the progression.

The group activity of writing questions at all six levels is the heart of this lesson. Students often struggle with Analyze vs. Evaluate—be ready to clarify the distinction (Analyze = break apart and find relationships; Evaluate = make judgments about quality or value).
