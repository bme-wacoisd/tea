# Six Levels of Thinking

Beyond "What?" Questions

---

## The Discovery

Most test questions only asked for recall.

Students were memorizing facts but not actually thinking.

Speaker notes: This is the problem Bloom identified when he analyzed thousands of test questions.

---

## Benjamin Bloom (1913–1999)

- Educational psychologist at University of Chicago
- Analyzed thousands of test questions
- Found most were basic recall
- Created a hierarchy of thinking levels
- Believed almost anyone can achieve mastery

Speaker notes: Bloom's work revolutionized how we think about learning objectives and assessment.

"What any person can learn, almost all persons can learn if provided with appropriate conditions."

## The Six Levels of Thinking

| Level | What It Means | Question Starters |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1. REMEMBER | Retrieve facts | What is...? List... Define... |
| 2. UNDERSTAND | Explain ideas | Explain... Summarize... Compare... |
| 3. APPLY | Use in new situations | How would you use...? Demonstrate... |
| 4. ANALYZE | Break apart, find relationships | Why...? What's the relationship...? |
| 5. EVALUATE | Make judgments | Which is better...? Justify... |
| 6. CREATE | Produce something new | Design... Invent... What if...? |

Speaker notes: The levels build on each other—you need to remember before you can understand, understand before you can apply, etc.

## Lower Order vs. Higher Order

| Lower Order | Higher Order |
|-------------|--------------|
| Remember | Analyze |
| Understand | Evaluate |
| Apply | Create |
| Necessary but not sufficient | Where deep thinking lives |

Speaker notes: Both are important, but higher-order thinking leads to deeper learning and retention.

---

## The "What" Trap

Teachers often only ask "What?" questions.

- What is photosynthesis?
- What are the branches of government?
- These are all REMEMBER level.

Speaker notes: "What" questions are easy to write but don't push students to think deeply.

---

## Transforming Questions

| Remember Level | Higher Level |
|----------------|--------------|
| What is photosynthesis? | Why does photosynthesis matter to animals? (Analyze) |
| What are the three branches? | Is the balance of powers working today? (Evaluate) |
| What happened in the story? | What if the character chose differently? (Create) |

Speaker notes: Notice how the higher-level questions require students to think, not just recall.

---

## The Question Ladder

- Start with Remember to activate knowledge
- Then CLIMB the ladder:
  1. What do plants need to grow? (Remember)
  2. Explain how plants get energy. (Understand)
  3. What would happen without plants? (Analyze)
  4. Design an experiment to test this. (Create)

Speaker notes: Good lessons climb the ladder, building from recall to higher-order thinking.

---

## Match Assessment to Objective

- If your objective says "analyze"...
- Your assessment must require analysis
- Not just recall of facts
- The verb in your objective = the level of thinking

Speaker notes: This is alignment—your assessment must match the cognitive level of your objective.

---

## Practice: What Level?

| Question | Level |
|----------|-------|
| List the parts of a cell | Remember |
| Explain how a cell gets energy | Understand |
| Compare plant and animal cells | Analyze |
| Design a cell that could survive on Mars | Create |

Speaker notes: Have students practice identifying levels in their own questions.

---

## The Research

Higher-order questions improve retention.

Even of lower-order facts. When students think deeply, they remember better.

Speaker notes: This is why Bloom's taxonomy matters—it's not just about harder questions, it's about better learning.

---

## Practical Strategies

- Audit your questions: What level are they?
- Plan questions at multiple levels
- Start low, build high
- Match assessments to objectives
- Don't skip levels—build systematically

Speaker notes: Give students tools they can use right away in their future classrooms.

## Closing

If you only ask "What?" you only get recall.

Teach students to think by asking them to think.
