# Group Discussion: Six Levels of Thinking

## Prompt 1: The "What" Trap
Think about the classes you're in right now. What kinds of questions do your teachers usually ask? Are they mostly "What is...?" questions, or do teachers ask you to analyze, evaluate, and create? Give specific examples from your recent experience.

## Prompt 2: Climbing the Ladder
Choose a topic from any subject (history, science, math, literature—anything). Write one question at each level of Bloom's taxonomy for that topic:
- Remember: What is/are...?
- Understand: Explain...
- Apply: How would you use...?
- Analyze: Why...? What's the relationship...?
- Evaluate: Which is better...? Justify...
- Create: Design... What if...?

## Prompt 3: Why Hierarchy Matters
Bloom's taxonomy is a hierarchy—each level builds on the ones below. Why can't you skip levels? What happens if a teacher asks students to "evaluate" something they don't yet "remember" or "understand"? Have you experienced this in a class?

## Prompt 4: The Retention Paradox
The reading claims that higher-order thinking helps students remember lower-order facts better. Why might this be true? Think about your own learning—when do you remember things longest? What makes information stick?

## Prompt 5: Matching Assessment to Objective
If a teacher's objective says "Students will analyze the causes of World War I," but the test only asks "List three causes of World War I," what's the problem? How would you design a test question that actually requires analysis?

## Prompt 6: Your Future Classroom
When you become a teacher, how will you make sure you're not stuck in the "What?" trap? What strategies or habits could help you plan questions at higher levels? How will you check yourself?
