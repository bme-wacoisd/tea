# Slides: Grant Sanderson — Teaching Math

## Planning Notes

This lesson teaches future educators how to teach math using Sanderson's visual-first approach:
- Start with concrete examples, not abstractions
- Use visualization to build intuition
- Treat math as beautiful, not just useful
- Videos build intuition but can't replace practice

## Slide Flow

1. **Title**: Grant Sanderson - 3Blue1Brown
2. **Who Is He?**: Stanford grad, YouTube creator, millions of subscribers
3. **Big Idea**: Start with the example, not the abstraction
4. **Traditional vs. Sanderson**: Comparison of textbook approach vs. his method
5. **Quote**: "Abstract concepts are best explained when preceded by concrete examples"
6. **Big Idea**: Treat math like art—beautiful, not just useful
7. **What Visualization Does**: IS/IS NOT comparison
8. **What Videos Can't Replace**: The hard work still matters
9. **Quote**: "Watching someone else solve math..."
10. **Adapting for Ages**: Table by grade level
11. **Group Discussion**: Instructions
12. **Closing Quote**: "The formula isn't the lesson. The understanding is."

## Color Theme

- Dark background (like 3Blue1Brown videos)
