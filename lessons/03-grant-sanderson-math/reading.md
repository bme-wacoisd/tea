**The most important idea in this reading:** Math makes sense when you can *see* it. Start with a concrete example, build intuition visually, and the abstract formula will follow naturally. Never the other way around.

Grant Sanderson didn't set out to become one of the most influential math teachers on the internet. He was a math major at Stanford who liked programming animations. Then he noticed something: concepts that felt confusing when written as symbols suddenly clicked when he could watch them move. A matrix transformation isn't just numbers in a grid—it's space stretching and rotating. Calculus isn't just rules for derivatives—it's watching how tiny changes ripple through a system. He started making videos showing these visualizations. Today, his YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown has millions of subscribers, and math teachers around the world use his videos to help students see what they're learning.

Sanderson's approach inverts how most math is taught. Textbooks typically start with the definition, then the theorem, then the proof, then some examples. Sanderson starts with the example. He asks: "What's a situation where this math naturally shows up? What problem are we trying to solve?" Once you understand the problem viscerally—once you can *see* it—the abstract notation becomes a tool for describing what you already understand. The formula stops being something to memorize and becomes something that makes sense.

Here's his secret: He treats math more like art than like engineering. When students ask "When will I ever use this?", Sanderson reframes the question. He says we don't ask that about Harry Potter or a beautiful sunset. We engage with fiction and art because of emotion, wonder, and imagination. Math, he argues, deserves the same treatment. The goal isn't just usefulness—it's *beauty*. When students see something beautiful, they want to understand it. Curiosity does the rest.

Sanderson is clear about what his videos can and cannot do. They're not a substitute for doing problems yourself. Watching someone else solve math is like watching someone else exercise—you don't get stronger. His videos are meant to "ground intuition into students' minds before they enter a course, so that when the details come up in class, they have some intuition." The hard work still happens in the classroom, with pencil and paper. But the intuition—the mental picture of what's really going on—that's what his approach builds.

For future teachers, Sanderson models a crucial principle: abstract concepts make sense when preceded by concrete examples. Don't start with the general rule. Start with the specific case. Let students play with it, visualize it, and discover the pattern. Then name the pattern. Then generalize. The formula isn't the lesson—the understanding is.
