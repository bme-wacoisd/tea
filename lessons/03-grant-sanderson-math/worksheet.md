# Group Discussion: Teaching Math Like Grant Sanderson

**Instructions**: Discuss these prompts verbally with your group. One person should take notes summarizing your key points.

---

## Prompt 1: Concrete Before Abstract

Sanderson says to start with a concrete example before introducing the abstract formula.

**Discuss**: Think of a math concept (fractions, area, percentages, etc.). How would you introduce it with a concrete example or visual BEFORE showing any symbols or formulas? Be specific.

---

## Prompt 2: Making Math Visible

Sanderson's videos show math in motion—matrices as space transforming, derivatives as rates you can watch change.

**Discuss**: What math concepts have you seen visualized effectively? What concepts do you wish had been visualized when you learned them? How might visualization have changed your understanding?

---

## Prompt 3: Math as Art

Sanderson argues we engage with fiction and art because of emotion, wonder, and imagination—not usefulness. He thinks math deserves the same.

**Discuss**: Do you find any part of math beautiful or wonder-inducing? What would it take for students to see math as something to enjoy, not just endure?

---

## Prompt 4: The Limits of Watching

Sanderson says: "Watching someone else solve math is like watching someone else exercise. You don't get stronger."

**Discuss**: If videos can build intuition but can't replace practice, how should a teacher balance showing visualizations with having students do problems themselves? When should each happen?

---

## Prompt 5: Adapting for Your Students

**Discuss**: Think about the grade level you're most interested in teaching. What tools or manipulatives could you use to make math visual for that age? (Blocks? Drawings? Graphs? Software?) How would you move from the visual to the abstract?

---

## Prompt 6: Flipping the Script

Most math teaching goes: Definition → Theorem → Proof → Examples.
Sanderson goes: Example → Visualize → Pattern → Name it → Generalize.

**Discuss**: Why might the traditional order feel safe to teachers? What challenges might Sanderson's approach create in a real classroom? How could you overcome them?
