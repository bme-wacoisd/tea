## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Explain Sanderson's "concrete example first" approach to teaching math
2. Describe how visualization builds mathematical intuition
3. Plan how to adapt visual teaching methods for different grade levels

## Standards Alignment

**Texas TEKS (Education and Training Career Cluster):**
- 130.122(c)(5)(A): Analyze methods for presenting subject matter effectively
- 130.122(c)(5)(B): Identify methods for enhancing student learning through multiple representations
- 130.122(c)(4)(A): Demonstrate techniques that foster student engagement and understanding

**Connection to Educator Preparation:**
- Develops skills in sequencing instruction (concrete to abstract)
- Emphasizes building conceptual understanding before procedural fluency
- Models use of visual and manipulative tools in math instruction

---

## Materials Needed

- [ ] Presentation slides (slides.yaml) - displayed via projector
- [ ] Reading passage (reading.md) - displayed for students
- [ ] Group discussion worksheet (worksheet.md) - on student devices
- [ ] Paper and pencils for note-taking
- [ ] Google Classroom quiz (from quiz.md)
- [ ] Optional: Physical manipulatives (blocks, shapes) for demonstration

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
**0:00 - 0:05**
- Ask: "Think of a math concept that felt confusing. What made it hard?"
- Brief poll: "How many of you have watched a math video on YouTube?"
- Introduce Grant Sanderson: Stanford grad, 3Blue1Brown creator, millions of subscribers
- Frame: "Today we'll learn how he makes complex math make sense—and how you can use these ideas."

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
**0:05 - 0:15**
- Present slides covering:
  - Who Sanderson is and what 3Blue1Brown does
  - His core principle: concrete before abstract
  - Traditional textbook order vs. his approach
  - Math as beauty, not just usefulness
  - What videos can and cannot do
- Read aloud the reading passage while students follow along
- Key check: "What does he mean by 'the formula isn't the lesson'?"

### Guided Practice - Group Discussion (15 minutes)
**0:15 - 0:30**
- Organize students into groups of 3-4
- Direct students to worksheet on devices
- Circulate among groups to:
  - Ask: "What's a specific visual you'd use for that concept?"
  - Push for concrete details, not vague answers
  - Connect discussion to their future grade levels
- At 0:28, give 2-minute warning

### Closure (5 minutes)
**0:30 - 0:35**
- Invite 2-3 groups to share specific visualizations they discussed
- Key takeaways:
  - Start with concrete examples, not abstractions
  - Visualization builds intuition—the mental picture
  - Seeing math as beautiful creates curiosity
  - Videos help, but students still need to DO the math
- Transition to quiz

### Assessment (5-8 minutes)
**0:35 - 0:40**
- Students complete quiz on Google Classroom
- Remind: questions randomized, no retakes

## Differentiation Strategies

**For students needing additional support:**
- Pair with peer who has positive math experiences
- Focus on Prompts 1 and 5 (most concrete)
- Provide examples: "For fractions, you might use pizza slices..."

**For advanced students:**
- Challenge: "How would you visualize a concept like probability or statistics?"
- Ask them to sketch a quick visual during discussion
- Explore Prompt 6 in depth (challenges of flipping the traditional order)

---

## Assessment

**Formative Assessment:**
- Observation during group discussions
- Specificity of visualization ideas students generate
- Connections to grade levels they want to teach

**Summative Assessment:**
- Google Classroom quiz (8 questions)
- Focus on understanding Sanderson's approach, not technical math content

## Appendix

**Key Vocabulary:**
- **Mathematical intuition**: An internal sense or mental picture of how math concepts work
- **Concrete to abstract**: Teaching sequence that starts with tangible examples before introducing symbols and formulas
- **Visualization**: Using images, diagrams, or animations to represent mathematical ideas

**About Grant Sanderson:**
Grant Sanderson (born 1988) is an American mathematician and creator of the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown. He graduated from Stanford University in 2015 with a degree in mathematics. He worked briefly at Khan Academy before focusing full-time on his channel. He developed Manim, a Python library for creating mathematical animations. His "Essence of Linear Algebra" and "Essence of Calculus" series are widely used by students and teachers worldwide.
