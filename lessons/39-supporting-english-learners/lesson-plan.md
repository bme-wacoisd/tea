## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Scenario: A student chats fluently at lunch but can't understand the textbook
- Ask: "Why might this happen?"
- Frame: Every teacher is a language teacher

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce BICS vs. CALP (Cummins's research)
  - BICS: 1-3 years, conversational
  - CALP: 5-7+ years, academic
- Present key strategies:
  - Visuals and demonstrations
  - Vocabulary pre-teaching
  - Sentence stems
  - Extended wait time
  - Strategic partnering
- Discuss what NOT to do (assume quiet = not learning, simplify content instead of language)
- Present home language as asset

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the home language section for emphasis

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Distinguish between accommodations and lowered expectations
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share strategies for the "silent student" scenario
- Discuss how to modify assignments without reducing challenge
- Address misconceptions about home language use

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Every teacher is a language teacher
- Home languages are assets, not barriers
- Challenge: In your next observation, notice how the teacher supports ELLs

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of accommodation examples; understanding of BICS vs. CALP
- **Summative**: Quiz on ELL strategies and research concepts

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide list of strategies as reference
- **For advanced students**: Research SIOP model or translanguaging
- **For ELL students**: Draw on their personal experience; they have expertise to share

## Instructor Notes

Some students in your class may BE English Language Learners. Honor their experience—they have firsthand knowledge of what helps and what doesn't. Invite (but don't pressure) them to share.

The BICS/CALP distinction is powerful because it challenges assumptions. When students "sound fluent" but struggle academically, teachers sometimes assume laziness or low ability. Understanding language development reframes the situation.

Common misconceptions to address:
- "Just speak more slowly" isn't a strategy
- Simplifying LANGUAGE is different from simplifying CONTENT
- Quiet students may be processing deeply, not confused
- Home language use doesn't slow English development—it supports it

The sentence stems strategy is immediately practical. Students can leave this lesson with sentence frames they can use in their next observation or tutoring session.
