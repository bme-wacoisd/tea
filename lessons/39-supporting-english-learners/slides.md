# Supporting English Learners in Every Classroom

Every Teacher Is a Language Teacher

---

## The Reality

In many Texas schools, a third or more of students are learning English while learning content.

This isn't just a specialist's job.
Every teacher is a language teacher.

Speaker notes: Future teachers will work in classrooms far more diverse than those they experienced.

## BICS vs. CALP

**BICS** - Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills
- "Playground language"
- Develops in 1-3 years
- "Let's play!" "What's for lunch?"

**CALP** - Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency
- "Classroom language"
- Takes 5-7+ years
- "Analyze the author's use of symbolism"

Speaker notes: Jim Cummins's research explains why fluent speakers struggle with academics.

## The Puzzle Explained

Student chats fluently at lunch but can't understand the textbook.

This doesn't mean they're lazy or incapable.

Conversational fluency ≠ Academic fluency

Speaker notes: BICS develops before CALP. Teachers need to understand this gap.

## Strategy 1: Visuals

- Pictures, diagrams, graphic organizers
- Demonstrate rather than just describe
- Use gestures and facial expressions
- Show, don't just tell

When words alone don't work, images help.

Speaker notes: Every lesson can include more visual support.

---

## Strategy 2: Pre-Teach Vocabulary

Before the lesson:
- Introduce key terms
- Connect to known concepts
- Use word walls
- Provide glossaries

Don't let students encounter new concepts AND new words at the same time.

Speaker notes: Even 5 minutes of vocabulary preview helps.

---

## Strategy 3: Sentence Stems

Give language frames:
- "I think ___ because ___"
- "This is similar to ___ because ___"
- "I agree/disagree because ___"

Reduces language production burden while maintaining high thinking.

Speaker notes: This scaffolds academic language without dumbing down content.

---

## Strategy 4: Wait Time and Partnering

**Wait Time**:
- 3-5+ seconds after questions
- Processing in two languages takes time
- Silence ≠ confusion

**Partnering**:
- Pair ELLs with supportive peers
- Think-Pair-Share reduces spotlight stress
- Authentic language practice

Speaker notes: Patience and partnerships create safety.

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't assume quiet = not learning
- Don't simplify CONTENT—just language
- Don't seat ELLs in the back
- Don't skip calling on ELLs
- Don't rely on students to translate for peers
- Don't grade based on English proficiency in non-language subjects

Speaker notes: These common mistakes marginalize ELLs.

---

## Home Language Is an Asset

Students who maintain their first language:
- Develop stronger cognitive skills
- Achieve better academic outcomes
- Maintain family and cultural connections
- Gain bilingual advantages for future careers

Encourage home language. It supports English development.

Speaker notes: The goal is additive, not subtractive.

---

## Closing

Every teacher is a language teacher.

Home languages are assets, not barriers. Welcome what students bring.

Speaker notes: Supporting ELLs is supporting all learners.
