# Group Discussion: Supporting English Learners

## Prompt 1: The BICS/CALP Gap
Why might a student who speaks English fluently on the playground struggle with classroom content? What does this tell you about assumptions you might make?

## Prompt 2: Sentence Stems
How are sentence stems (like "I think ___ because ___") different from "dumbing down" content? What do they accomplish?

## Prompt 3: Home Language as Asset
Why is maintaining home language an asset, not a barrier, to English development? How might you support students' home languages in your classroom?

## Prompt 4: The Silent Student
You're teaching a science lesson. An ELL student is silent during discussion. What might be happening? What could you do to support their participation?

## Prompt 5: Modifying Without Reducing
How might you modify a reading assignment for an ELL without reducing the intellectual challenge? What would you keep the same, and what would you change?

## Prompt 6: Accommodations vs. Lowering Expectations
What's the difference between accommodations for ELLs and lowering expectations? Give an example of each.
