# Supporting English Learners in Every Classroom

In many Texas schools, a third or more of students are learning English while learning content. This isn't just a specialist's job—every teacher is a language teacher, whether they realize it or not. Future teachers will likely work in classrooms far more linguistically diverse than those they experienced as students. Understanding how to support English Language Learners (ELLs) isn't optional; it's essential for reaching every student.

One of the most important concepts for understanding ELLs comes from researcher Jim Cummins: the difference between BICS and CALP. BICS stands for Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills—the conversational language students pick up in one to three years through everyday interaction. CALP stands for Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency—the academic language of textbooks, essays, and formal discussion, which takes five to seven years or more to develop. This explains a puzzling phenomenon: a student who chats fluently on the playground may struggle to understand the science textbook. They sound fluent, so teachers assume they should be able to keep up academically. But conversational fluency and academic fluency are different things.

Several strategies help ELLs succeed in any classroom. Use visuals—pictures, diagrams, demonstrations, and gestures make content comprehensible when words alone don't. Pre-teach key vocabulary before the lesson so students aren't encountering new concepts AND new words simultaneously. Provide sentence stems like "I think ___ because ___" that scaffold academic language while maintaining high thinking. Allow extended wait time—processing in two languages takes longer, and silence isn't confusion, it's thinking. Partner ELLs with supportive English-proficient peers for think-pair-share activities that reduce spotlight stress while providing authentic practice.

Finally, recognize that students' home languages are assets, not barriers. Students who maintain their first language while learning English develop stronger cognitive skills, achieve better academic outcomes, and maintain crucial family connections. Don't discourage home language use—encourage it. The goal isn't to replace one language with another; it's to add English to what students already bring. Welcome and honor the linguistic resources students carry into your classroom. They're not starting from zero—they're building on a foundation.
