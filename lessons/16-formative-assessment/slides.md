# Checking for Understanding

Every Six Minutes

---

## The Problem

Teacher teaches. Test on Friday. Half the class fails.

Too late—the learning moment has passed. The teacher moves on. The confusion compounds.

Speaker notes: This is the cycle Dylan Wiliam's research aimed to break.

## Quote

"The shorter the assessment-action cycle, the greater the impact on learning. Not every six weeks. Not every six days. Every six minutes."

— Dylan Wiliam

## Dylan Wiliam

- Emeritus Professor, University of London
- Decades researching what improves learning
- Found: formative assessment has massive impact
- But feedback alone isn't enough...

Speaker notes: Wiliam's research revolutionized how we think about classroom assessment.

## Quote

"Feedback is formative only if the information fed back to the learner is used by the learner in improving performance."

— Dylan Wiliam

## Three Types of Assessment

| Type | When | Purpose | Example |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| DIAGNOSTIC | Before | What do they already know? | Pre-test, KWL chart |
| FORMATIVE | During | Are they understanding? | Exit tickets, thumbs up/down |
| SUMMATIVE | After | Did they achieve the goals? | Unit test, final project |

Speaker notes: Formative is during—that's what makes it different.

## The Key Shift

| Old Question | New Question |
|--------------|--------------|
| Did I teach it? | Did they learn it? |
| Did I cover the content? | Can they demonstrate understanding? |
| Did I give enough information? | What do they need next? |

Speaker notes: The focus shifts from teacher actions to student learning.

## Wiliam's Five Key Strategies

1. **CLARIFY learning intentions** — Students know what they're aiming for
2. **ENGINEER discussions that reveal thinking** — Activities that show understanding
3. **PROVIDE feedback that moves learning forward** — Comments that cause thinking
4. **ACTIVATE students as resources for each other** — Peer feedback
5. **ACTIVATE students as owners of their own learning** — Self-assessment

Speaker notes: These five strategies form the core of formative assessment practice.

## What Makes Feedback Effective?

| Doesn't Cause Thinking | Causes Thinking |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| "Good job!" | "Your introduction hooks the reader, but..." |
| "92%" | "The evidence doesn't connect to your claim" |
| "Try harder" | "Try explaining WHY the quote supports your point" |
| "See me" | Specific, forward-looking, actionable |

Speaker notes: Good feedback makes students think, not just feel.

## Quick Formative Techniques

- **Exit tickets** — Quick check at end of class
- **Thumbs up/middle/down** — Instant whole-class check
- **Whiteboards** — All students show answers simultaneously
- **Think-Pair-Share** — Process before responding
- **No hands up** — Random calling prevents opt-out
- **Wait time** — 3-5 seconds after questions

Speaker notes: These techniques can be used daily without adding prep time.

## AI and Assessment

AI tutors can check every six seconds.

But students don't trust AI for final evaluation. AI asks "Is this correct?" Teachers ask "What were you thinking?"

Speaker notes: AI augments but doesn't replace teacher judgment.

---

## Practical Steps

- Use exit tickets daily
- Wait 3-5 seconds after questions
- Make feedback specific and forward-looking
- Check understanding BEFORE moving on
- Adjust instruction based on what you learn

Speaker notes: Start with one technique and build from there.

## Closing

Formative assessment isn't about more tests.

It's about knowing whether they're learning while there's still time to help.
