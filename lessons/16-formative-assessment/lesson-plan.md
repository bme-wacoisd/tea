## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define formative assessment and distinguish it from diagnostic and summative assessment
2. Explain why the timing of assessment matters (short cycles vs. waiting)
3. Identify characteristics of feedback that causes thinking vs. feedback that doesn't
4. Describe at least three quick formative assessment techniques they could use in a classroom

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Scenario: "You teach a lesson Monday. Test Friday. Half fail. Now what?"
- Discuss the problem: the learning moment has passed
- Introduce Dylan Wiliam's solution: check every six minutes, not every six days

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Present the three types of assessment (diagnostic, formative, summative)
- Explain Wiliam's five key strategies
- Compare feedback that causes thinking vs. feedback that doesn't
- Demonstrate quick techniques: thumbs up/down, exit tickets, wait time
- Address AI's role: instant feedback vs. teacher judgment

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause to demonstrate wait time (ask a question, count silently to 5)

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Groups practice giving feedback that causes thinking
- Instructor circulates and models formative checking

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share which techniques they'd feel comfortable using
- Discuss the AI question: what can teachers do that AI can't?
- Address the "Did I teach it?" vs. "Did they learn it?" shift

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Formative assessment isn't more tests—it's knowing in time to help
- Challenge: This week, notice when your teachers check for understanding

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Use techniques during this very lesson (thumbs up/down, wait time) to model the content
- **Summative**: Quiz on assessment types and feedback characteristics

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide a graphic organizer comparing the three assessment types
- **For advanced students**: Analyze actual feedback examples and rewrite them to cause thinking
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (formative, summative, diagnostic, feedback)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson MUST model formative assessment. Use the techniques you're teaching:
- Use wait time when asking questions
- Do a thumbs up/down check after explaining the three types
- Use an exit ticket at the end

The feedback comparison (causes thinking vs. doesn't) is the heart of this lesson. Have students practice rewriting weak feedback into strong feedback. This is where the skill develops, not just the knowledge.

Point out explicitly when you're using formative techniques: "Notice I'm waiting five seconds before calling on anyone. That's wait time."
