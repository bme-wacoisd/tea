# Group Discussion: Checking for Understanding

## Prompt 1: Feedback That Worked
Think of a time you got feedback that actually helped you improve—feedback that made you think and showed you what to do differently. What made it useful? What was it about that feedback that other feedback lacked?

## Prompt 2: Formative vs. More Tests
Some people hear "formative assessment" and think it means giving more quizzes and tests. How is formative assessment different from just testing more often? What's the key distinction?

## Prompt 3: The Six-Minute Cycle
Wiliam says the shorter the assessment-action cycle, the better. What does it look like to check understanding every six minutes? How would you do this without slowing down your lesson or making students feel tested constantly?

## Prompt 4: What's Wrong with Scores?
Wiliam argues that feedback like "92%" or "B+" doesn't cause thinking. What's missing from that kind of feedback? If you got a paper back with just a grade, what would you need to actually improve?

## Prompt 5: Techniques You'd Use
Look at the formative assessment techniques discussed: exit tickets, thumbs up/down, whiteboards, think-pair-share, no hands up, wait time. Which would you feel most comfortable using? Which seems hardest to implement? Why?

## Prompt 6: AI and Human Assessment
An AI tutor can check understanding every few seconds. A teacher checks every few minutes at best. What can a teacher's formative assessment provide that AI cannot? When a student gets something wrong, what can a teacher do that an AI can't?
