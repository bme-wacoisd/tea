# Checking for Understanding Every Six Minutes

Imagine this scene: A teacher teaches a lesson on Monday. She explains, gives examples, answers questions. On Friday, she gives a test. Half the class fails. Now what? The learning moment has passed. She has to move on to the next unit, but half her students are still confused about the last one. This is the problem Dylan Wiliam, a professor at the University of London, spent decades trying to solve. His research led to a simple but powerful conclusion: the shorter the time between checking understanding and taking action, the greater the impact on learning. Not every six weeks. Not every six days. Every six minutes.

There are three types of assessment, and understanding the difference matters. Diagnostic assessment happens before instruction—it tells you what students already know and what misconceptions they carry. Formative assessment happens during instruction—it tells you whether students are understanding so you can adjust in real time. Summative assessment happens after instruction—it measures whether students achieved the learning goals. Most teachers are familiar with summative assessment: the unit test, the final exam, the grade on the report card. But Wiliam's research shows that formative assessment—the ongoing checks during learning—has far more impact on student achievement than any end-of-unit test.

But here's the catch: feedback alone isn't formative. Wiliam is clear about this. "Feedback is formative only if the information fed back to the learner is used by the learner in improving performance." Telling a student "92%" doesn't help them improve. Telling a student "Good job!" feels nice but doesn't cause thinking. Effective feedback is specific, forward-looking, and actionable: "Your introduction hooks the reader, but your evidence in paragraph two doesn't connect to your claim. Try explaining WHY the quote supports your point." That kind of feedback makes the student think. It points toward improvement. It's formative because it forms better learning.

Wiliam identified five key strategies for formative assessment. First, clarify and share learning intentions—students need to know what they're aiming for. Second, engineer effective discussions and tasks—design activities that reveal student thinking, not just right answers. Third, provide feedback that moves learning forward—comments that cause thinking and point toward improvement. Fourth, activate students as learning resources for each other—peer feedback can be as powerful as teacher feedback. Fifth, activate students as owners of their own learning—teach students to assess themselves.

The practical techniques are simple: exit tickets at the end of class, thumbs up/middle/down for instant whole-class checks, mini whiteboards where all students show answers simultaneously, think-pair-share to process before responding, random calling so students can't opt out, and wait time—three to five seconds of silence after asking a question before calling on anyone. These techniques take almost no prep time but transform a classroom from "teacher talks, students listen" to "teacher checks, teacher adjusts, students learn." The key shift is from asking "Did I teach it?" to asking "Did they learn it?" That question—asked every six minutes—changes everything.
