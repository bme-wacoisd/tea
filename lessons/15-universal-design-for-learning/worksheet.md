# Group Discussion: Designing for All Learners

## Prompt 1: The Curb Cut Effect in Your Life
Think of a time when something designed to help one group ended up helping you—even though you weren't the intended user. (Examples: captions, automatic doors, audiobooks, voice-to-text.) How does this connect to Universal Design for Learning?

## Prompt 2: The Forgotten Principle
Look at the three UDL principles: Engagement (the WHY), Representation (the WHAT), and Action & Expression (the HOW). Which do you think teachers most often forget or neglect? Why might that be? What are the consequences for students?

## Prompt 3: One Lesson, Built-In Flexibility
How is UDL different from creating separate activities for different students? If UDL isn't three different lessons, what does "one lesson with built-in flexibility" actually look like? Give a concrete example.

## Prompt 4: Design a UDL-Friendly Lesson
Pick a specific lesson topic (fractions, the water cycle, a historical event, a grammar concept). How could you apply each of the three UDL principles? What choices would you offer? What formats would you use? How could students demonstrate their learning?

## Prompt 5: Rigor and Flexibility
Some teachers worry that offering choices means "anything goes" and standards will slip. How would you maintain rigor—high expectations for all students—while still offering flexibility in HOW they learn and HOW they show what they know?

## Prompt 6: Your UDL Classroom
If you were designing a classroom from scratch using UDL principles, what would it look like physically? What materials would be available? How would the space support multiple means of engagement, representation, and action?
