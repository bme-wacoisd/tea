# Designing for All Learners

Universal Design for Learning

---

## The Problem

Teachers design for "average" students, then scramble to accommodate everyone else.

What if you designed for everyone from the start?

Speaker notes: This is the fundamental insight behind Universal Design for Learning.

## CAST and Universal Design

- Center for Applied Special Technology (1990s)
- Borrowed concept from architecture
- Curb cuts help wheelchair users—and everyone
- Design that helps struggling learners helps ALL learners

Speaker notes: The architectural concept of universal design inspired the educational framework.

## Quote

"When curricula are designed for the 'average,' they fail to provide all individuals with fair and equal opportunities."

— Anne Meyer & David Rose, CAST founders

## The Curb Cut Effect

Accommodations designed for some often help everyone.

- Captions help deaf students—and everyone in a noisy room.
- Clear objectives help confused students—and all students.

Speaker notes: This is why UDL benefits everyone, not just students with disabilities.

## The Three UDL Principles

| Principle | The Question | Design For |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| ENGAGEMENT | WHY should students care? | Motivation, interest, relevance |
| REPRESENTATION | WHAT information is presented? | Multiple formats, examples, modalities |
| ACTION & EXPRESSION | HOW do students show learning? | Flexible ways to demonstrate |

Speaker notes: These three principles cover the full learning cycle.

---

## Multiple Means of ENGAGEMENT

- Offer choices and autonomy
- Connect to student interests
- Minimize threats and distractions
- Foster collaboration and community
- Some students: competition. Others: cooperation. Design for both.

Speaker notes: Engagement is about the WHY—why should students care about this?

---

## Multiple Means of REPRESENTATION

- Don't just lecture—also provide text, diagrams, videos
- Offer alternatives to visual information (audio)
- Offer alternatives to auditory information (captions)
- Highlight patterns and big ideas
- Provide multiple examples AND non-examples

Speaker notes: Representation is about the WHAT—how information is presented.

---

## Multiple Means of ACTION & EXPRESSION

- Allow varied ways to respond
- Provide options for physical action
- Support planning and strategy development
- Show understanding through writing, drawing, speaking, building

Speaker notes: Action & Expression is about the HOW—how students demonstrate learning.

## What UDL IS and IS NOT

| UDL IS NOT | UDL IS |
|------------|--------|
| Just technology | Proactive design |
| Lowering standards | Same goals, flexible paths |
| Three different lessons | One lesson with built-in flexibility |
| Reactive accommodation | Planning for variability |

Speaker notes: UDL is about designing differently, not lowering the bar.

## The Myth of Average

When the Air Force designed cockpits for the "average" pilot, they fit NO ONE.

The solution: adjustable seats. Education needs adjustable curricula.

Speaker notes: Todd Rose's research at Harvard showed there's no such thing as an "average" learner.

---

## Practical Steps

- Build choice into every lesson
- Provide information in multiple formats
- Allow multiple ways to demonstrate learning
- Ask: "Who might this NOT work for?"
- Design for variability, not the "average"

Speaker notes: These are concrete habits to build into lesson planning.

## Closing

You know your class will have variability.

Design for it from the start.
