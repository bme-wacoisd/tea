## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain what Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is and why it matters
2. List and describe the three UDL principles (Engagement, Representation, Action & Expression)
3. Apply the "curb cut effect" concept to educational design
4. Distinguish between proactive UDL design and reactive accommodation

## Texas TEKS Alignment

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 7 | **The student creates an effective learning environment** - Universal Design for Learning |
| 4 | **The student understands the learner and the learning process** - meeting needs of diverse learners |

## Materials Needed

- Slides presentation (Google Slides)
- Reading handout or projected text
- Worksheet for group discussion
- Quiz (Google Forms)

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Show image of a curb cut
- Ask: "Who does this help?" (Collect responses: wheelchairs, strollers, bikes, luggage...)
- Introduce the curb cut effect: design for some helps all
- Connect to education: What if we designed lessons this way?

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce CAST and the UDL framework
- Present the three principles with concrete examples:
  - Engagement: WHY should students care? (choice, relevance)
  - Representation: WHAT information? (multiple formats)
  - Action & Expression: HOW show learning? (flexible demonstration)
- Address the "myth of average" (Air Force cockpit example)
- Clarify what UDL is NOT (lowering standards, three different lessons)

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause to reinforce the curb cut effect examples

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Groups design a UDL-friendly version of a lesson topic
- Instructor circulates to ensure all three principles are addressed

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share their UDL lesson designs
- Address the rigor/flexibility tension
- Discuss why proactive design beats reactive accommodation

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: You know your class will have variability—design for it from the start
- Challenge: This week, notice when something designed for "some" helps you too

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of UDL lesson designs during group work; accurate identification of the three principles
- **Summative**: Quiz on UDL principles and the curb cut effect

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide a graphic organizer with the three principles; use more concrete examples
- **For advanced students**: Research CAST's detailed UDL Guidelines and present additional strategies
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (universal, accommodation, proactive, variability)

---

## Instructor Notes

This lesson should MODEL UDL principles:
- **Engagement**: Offer choice in which topic groups design their UDL lesson around
- **Representation**: Provide both verbal explanation and visual slides/handouts
- **Action & Expression**: Let students share their designs through discussion, not just writing

Point out explicitly how this lesson uses UDL—make the meta-teaching visible. The group design activity is key because it requires students to apply all three principles, not just identify them.
