# Designing for All Learners from the Start

In the 1990s, researchers at CAST—the Center for Applied Special Technology—noticed something frustrating happening in schools everywhere. Teachers would design their lessons for "typical" students, then scramble to create accommodations when students with disabilities couldn't access the material. It was reactive, time-consuming, and often felt like an afterthought. What if teachers designed for everyone from the start? CAST borrowed a concept from architecture called "universal design." The classic example is the sidewalk curb cut—those small ramps at street corners originally mandated for wheelchair access. But curb cuts help everyone: parents pushing strollers, travelers pulling luggage, delivery workers with carts, cyclists, people with walkers. The accommodation became the standard because it turned out to be better design for all.

Anne Meyer and David Rose, CAST's co-founders, applied this insight to education. They developed the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework around a simple truth: learner variability is the norm, not the exception. Designing for the "average" student means designing for no one—because the average student doesn't exist. Todd Rose, a researcher at Harvard, demonstrated this by analyzing Air Force data: when the military designed cockpits for the pilot with average arm length, average leg length, and average torso, the cockpit fit exactly zero actual pilots. The solution wasn't different cockpits for different body types—it was adjustable seats. Education needs the same thing: adjustable curricula that work for the variability you know will be in every classroom.

UDL has three core principles. First, provide multiple means of ENGAGEMENT—this addresses the WHY of learning. Why should students care? Some students are motivated by competition; others freeze up under competitive pressure. Some thrive in collaboration; others prefer working alone. Design for both. Offer choices. Connect to student interests. Minimize threats. Second, provide multiple means of REPRESENTATION—this addresses the WHAT. How is information presented? Don't just lecture—also provide text, diagrams, videos, and hands-on materials. Offer alternatives: captions for auditory content, audio descriptions for visual content. Present multiple examples and non-examples. Third, provide multiple means of ACTION and EXPRESSION—this addresses the HOW. How do students demonstrate what they know? Let them show understanding through writing, drawing, speaking, building, or performing. Support planning and strategy development. Allow different physical means of interaction.

The "curb cut effect" appears everywhere in UDL. Captions were originally designed for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers, but they help everyone in a noisy gym, a quiet library, or learning a second language. Clear learning objectives were championed for students who struggle with ambiguity, but they help every student focus their attention. Graphic organizers were developed for students with executive function challenges, but they help all writers organize their thinking. When you design to remove barriers for some, you often improve the experience for all.

UDL is NOT about lowering standards—everyone works toward the same learning goals. It's NOT about creating three different lessons—it's about building flexibility into one lesson. It's NOT reactive accommodation after the fact—it's proactive design from the beginning. And it's NOT just about technology, though technology can certainly help. UDL is a mindset shift: instead of asking "how do I accommodate this student who can't access my lesson," you ask during planning, "who might this NOT work for, and how can I build in flexibility now?" You know your class will include visual learners and auditory learners, fast readers and slow readers, students who love to write and students who hate it. Design for that variability from the start.
