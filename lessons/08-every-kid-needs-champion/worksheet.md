# Group Discussion: Every Kid Needs a Champion

## Prompt 1: The Teacher Who Believed
Think about a teacher who believed in you—someone who made you feel capable, seen, or valued. What specific things did they do or say that showed their belief? How did it affect how you approached their class?

## Prompt 2: The +2 Approach
Rita Pierson wrote "+2" instead of "-18" on a student's test. Both communicate the same factual information, but the message is completely different. How might you apply this "+2" thinking in different subjects or situations? What are the limits of this approach?

## Prompt 3: Champions vs. Tolerators
Pierson describes the difference between teachers who champion students and those who merely tolerate them. What does it look like, day to day, to be a champion? How might a tolerator and a champion respond differently to the same struggling student?

## Prompt 4: The Power of Apology
Pierson said, "I came in on a Monday and said, 'I was wrong yesterday.'" Why does admitting mistakes build trust? When is it appropriate for teachers to apologize to students, and when might it not be?

## Prompt 5: Professional Boundaries
How do you build genuine relationships with students while maintaining professional boundaries? Where is the line between being a champion and being a friend?

## Prompt 6: The AI Question
An AI tutor can provide unlimited patience and instant feedback at any hour. It never has a bad day. What can it NOT provide that Pierson's students received from her? As future teachers, what parts of teaching should you never outsource to technology?
