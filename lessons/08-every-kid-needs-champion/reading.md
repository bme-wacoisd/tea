# Every Kid Needs a Champion

Think about a teacher who believed in you. Not one who just taught you content, but one who made you feel capable of things you doubted. What did they do differently? Research confirms what you probably felt: the relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of learning. James Comer, the child psychiatrist, put it plainly: "No significant learning can occur without a significant relationship." Kids don't learn from people they don't like. They don't take risks for teachers who don't seem to care whether they succeed.

Consider what happens when a student misses eighteen out of twenty questions on a test. One teacher writes "-18" at the top. Another writes "+2" with a smiley face and says, "You got two right. You didn't miss them all." Same factual information, completely different message. One says "you failed." The other says "you started—keep going." Rita Pierson, a third-generation educator whose TED Talk has been viewed over fifteen million times, made this simple reframing famous. But every effective teacher knows some version of this truth: how we frame feedback shapes how students see themselves.

The teachers who become champions do something else that feels risky: they show vulnerability. They come in on a Monday and say, "I was wrong yesterday. I apologize." That simple admission builds trust. It models what we want students to learn about admitting mistakes. It shows them we're human, that we care about the relationship enough to be honest. Some teachers worry this undermines their authority. In practice, it strengthens it.

What separates teachers who champion students from those who merely tolerate them? Champions believe improvement is possible. They see potential, not just current performance. They build relationships intentionally—learning names quickly, greeting students at the door, remembering details about their lives. They celebrate small wins and refuse to give up on struggling students. Tolerators keep professional distance, focus on behavior rather than growth, and move difficult students along to the next grade.

In the years to come, students will have access to AI tutors that are infinitely patient, available at any hour, and never have a bad day. These tools can explain concepts in forty different ways without getting frustrated. But they cannot believe in a student. They cannot look at a child who just failed and genuinely think, "I know you can do better." They cannot witness growth over time and feel proud. They cannot be a champion. That remains the irreplaceable work of human teachers—seeing students, believing in them, and never giving up.
