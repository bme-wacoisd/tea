## Instructor Notes

This lesson should EMBODY Pierson's approach. Greet students warmly. Use their names. Communicate belief in their potential as future educators. The way you teach this lesson is itself a model of what you're teaching.

Consider showing a 2-3 minute clip from Pierson's TED Talk if time allows—her delivery is powerful and students respond to her warmth.
