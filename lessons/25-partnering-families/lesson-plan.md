## Instructor Notes

This lesson models clear, respectful communication. Use plain language in the slides and reading—avoid the jargon the lesson warns against.

The angry parent scenario (Prompt 3) is important. Common student responses:
- "Explain why the grade is fair" (misses the need to listen first)
- "Tell them to calm down" (escalates the situation)
- Better: Listen, acknowledge feelings, then problem-solve together

When discussing invisible families, challenge assumptions gently. Families may have work schedules, lack transportation, feel unwelcome, or have past negative experiences. Invisibility doesn't equal apathy.

The expertise conflict scenario (Prompt 6) has no easy answer. The goal is thoughtful consideration of both perspectives.
