# Group Discussion: Partnering with Families

## Prompt 1: Communication You've Received
Think about communication you've received from schools—as a student or from a family member's school. What made some messages effective? What made others fall flat or feel impersonal?

## Prompt 2: Why "Positive First" Matters
Why is contacting families with positive news first a strategic choice, not just a "nice" thing to do? What happens when a family's only experience with teacher contact is bad news?

## Prompt 3: The Angry Parent
A parent comes to you, visibly angry about their child's grade. They feel their child was treated unfairly. How do you de-escalate this situation and move toward a productive conversation? What do you say first?

## Prompt 4: Language Barriers
How might a teacher need to adapt their communication for a family where English is not the home language? What resources should be available? What should teachers avoid doing?

## Prompt 5: Invisible Doesn't Mean Uninvolved
Some families don't attend back-to-school nights, conferences, or school events. What assumptions might teachers make about these families? What might actually be preventing their presence? How do you reach families who aren't visible?

## Prompt 6: When Expertise Conflicts
You believe a student would benefit from being evaluated for a learning disability. The family disagrees—they worry about labels and stigma. How do you balance respecting family expertise and concerns with your professional judgment about what the student needs?
