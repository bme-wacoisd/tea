# Partnering with Families

Building Relationships That Support Student Learning

---

## The Research

Family engagement is one of the strongest predictors of student success.

Stronger than family income. Stronger than parent education level.

When teachers and families partner, students thrive.

Speaker notes: This isn't just feel-good advice—it's research-backed strategy.

## The "Positive First" Principle

Many families only hear from school when something's wrong.

Phone rings → Brace for bad news.

Transform this by making positive contacts FIRST.

Speaker notes: Build a history of positive interactions before difficult conversations.

---

## Positive Contact Examples

- "I wanted you to know how well Marcus participated today."
- "Jasmine helped another student with math—I thought you'd want to hear."
- "Carlos was so engaged in our science experiment!"

When families know you see their child's strengths, difficult conversations are easier.

Speaker notes: These calls take 2 minutes but build lasting trust.

## One-Way vs. Two-Way Communication

| One-Way | Two-Way |
|---------|---------|
| Newsletters | Conversations |
| Announcements | Phone calls |
| Websites | Conferences |
| Syllabi | Listening |

Both matter—but two-way builds relationships.

Speaker notes: Information is necessary but not sufficient.

## Breaking Down Barriers

| Barrier | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| Language | Translation services (not students) |
| Time | Flexible meeting times, multiple channels |
| Trust | Consistency, listening, respect |
| Culture | Learn about communities you serve |

Speaker notes: Different families need different approaches.

## Common Mistakes

- Using jargon: "phonemic awareness" instead of "letter sounds"
- Only focusing on problems
- Assuming absent families don't care
- Same communication for all families
- Implying problems are the family's fault

Speaker notes: Check your messages for these patterns.

## Conference Structure

1. Start positive — something genuine
2. Share data — where the student is
3. Identify goals — what we're working on
4. Listen — what do you see at home?
5. Plan together — next steps for school AND home
6. End with hope — express belief in the student

Speaker notes: 15-20 minutes. Keep it focused.

---

## When Conversations Are Difficult

Frame as partnership: "I need your help understanding..."

Be specific: Describe behaviors, not character.

Listen first: "What do you see at home?"

Focus on solutions: What can we try?

Follow up: Don't drop the ball.

Speaker notes: Hard news requires extra care with relationship.

---

## The Angry Parent

A parent is upset about their child's grade.

**Wrong approach**: Explain why you're right.

**Better approach**: Listen first. Acknowledge feelings. Problem-solve together.

Speaker notes: They need to feel heard before they can hear you.

---

## Invisible ≠ Uninvolved

Families who don't attend events may have:
- Work schedules that conflict
- Transportation challenges
- Past negative school experiences
- Childcare for other children

Reach out to them—don't wait for them to appear.

Speaker notes: Don't mistake visibility for caring.

---

## Closing

Communication is partnership, not announcement.

Make positive contacts before negative ones. Listen more than you talk. Honor family expertise about their child.

Speaker notes: Strong family relationships support everything else you do.
