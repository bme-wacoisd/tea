## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask: "Have you ever been in a situation where you needed something different to succeed?"
- Collect responses—examples might include glasses, tutoring, accommodations for testing
- Connect: Some students need specific supports built into their school experience

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce IDEA (creates IEPs) and Section 504 (creates 504 Plans)
- Explain key difference: specialized instruction vs. accommodations for access
- Define accommodation vs. modification with examples
- Walk through common accommodation categories (presentation, response, setting, scheduling)
- Clarify teacher responsibilities and legal requirements

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at the "fair doesn't mean same" concept for emphasis

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key discussions: accommodation vs. modification, responding to "that's not fair"
- Instructor circulates to ensure accurate understanding

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share responses to the "that's not fair" scenario
- Clarify any confusion about when to use accommodations vs. modifications
- Emphasize: these are legal requirements, not suggestions

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Fair means everyone gets what they need
- Preview: You will read actual IEPs and 504 Plans for every student in your future classes
- Remind: Implementation is required every day, not just during observations

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Accuracy of understanding during discussions; ability to distinguish IEP from 504
- **Summative**: Quiz on key concepts, accommodations vs. modifications, and teacher responsibilities

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide comparison chart of IEP vs. 504 as reference
- **For advanced students**: Research the 13 IDEA disability categories
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (accommodation, modification, individualized, disability)

## Instructor Notes

Approach this topic from a mindset of genuine inclusion, not compliance. The goal is for future teachers to see accommodations as essential supports, not burdens or unfair advantages.

When discussing the "that's not fair" scenario, emphasize what teachers CAN and CANNOT say:
- You CAN discuss fairness as meeting individual needs
- You CANNOT disclose another student's disability status

If students ask about their own experiences with IEPs or 504 Plans, allow voluntary sharing but don't pressure anyone to disclose personal information.

Remind students: Before school starts each year, request and read every IEP and 504 for students in your classes.
