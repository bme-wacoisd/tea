# Group Discussion: Meeting Students Where They Are

## Prompt 1: Accommodation vs. Modification
What's the difference between an accommodation (changing HOW a student learns) and a modification (changing WHAT a student learns)? Come up with two examples of each. When would you use one vs. the other?

## Prompt 2: Least Restrictive Environment
The law requires that students with disabilities be educated in the "Least Restrictive Environment" (LRE)—with non-disabled peers as much as possible. Why do you think this principle matters? What are the benefits and challenges of inclusion?

## Prompt 3: The Unused Accommodation
A student has extended time on tests as an accommodation, but they never actually use it—they turn in tests early and seem to rush through. What might be going on? What would you do?

## Prompt 4: "That's Not Fair!"
A classmate says to you: "Why does she get extra time? That's not fair—I want extra time too!" How would you respond? What language would you use? What can you NOT say?

## Prompt 5: Implementation Failure
What happens if a teacher consistently fails to implement a student's IEP or 504 accommodations? Who is affected? What are the potential consequences—for the student and for the teacher?

## Prompt 6: Normalizing Support
How can you build a classroom culture where accommodations are normalized instead of stigmatized? What practices, language, or structures would help ensure that students with IEPs or 504 Plans feel included rather than singled out?
