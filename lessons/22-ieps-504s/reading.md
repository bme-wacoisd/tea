# Meeting Students Where They Are

Every child deserves access to education. For most students, showing up to class and following along is enough. But for some students, learning works differently. Maybe they need information presented in a particular way. Maybe they need extra time to process ideas. Maybe they need a quieter space to think. These aren't problems to fix—they're realities to accommodate. And in the United States, the law guarantees that schools must meet these students where they are. Two key legal frameworks make this happen: the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which creates Individualized Education Programs or IEPs, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which creates 504 Plans. As a teacher, you will work with students who have both.

An IEP is for students who need specialized instruction—not just adjustments to how they learn, but actual changes to what or how they are taught. To qualify, a student must have a disability in one of 13 categories defined by federal law, and that disability must affect their educational performance. IEPs are detailed documents. They describe where the student currently is academically and functionally, set specific measurable goals for the year, and spell out exactly what services and supports will be provided. This might include time with a special education teacher, speech therapy, occupational therapy, or counseling. It also includes accommodations—like extended time or preferential seating—and sometimes modifications, which actually change the content or expectations of assignments. IEPs are created by teams that include parents, general education teachers, special education teachers, and administrators. They are reviewed annually and updated as the student's needs change.

A 504 Plan is simpler but equally important. It's for students who have a disability that affects a major life activity (including learning) but who don't need specialized instruction—they just need accommodations to access the same curriculum as everyone else. A student with ADHD might have a 504 Plan that gives them preferential seating and extra time on tests. A student with diabetes might have a plan allowing them to eat snacks and access the nurse. A student with anxiety might be allowed breaks or a quiet testing space. The accommodations remove barriers so the student can demonstrate what they know.

As a teacher, you are legally required to implement the accommodations in every IEP and 504 Plan for every student in your class—every day, not just during observations. You must read these documents, understand them, and follow them. Failing to do so isn't just poor teaching—it's a violation of civil rights law. But more importantly, these plans exist because every student deserves a fair shot at learning. When you provide accommodations, you're not giving a student an unfair advantage. You're leveling a playing field that was uneven to begin with. Fair doesn't mean everyone gets the same thing. Fair means everyone gets what they need.
