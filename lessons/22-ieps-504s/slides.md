# Meeting Students Where They Are

IEPs and 504 Plans

---

## Every Child Deserves Access

Some students need specific supports to access education. These aren't favors—they're rights.

Speaker notes: This isn't about giving advantages. It's about leveling uneven playing fields.

---

## Two Key Laws

| Law | What It Creates | Who Qualifies |
|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| IDEA | IEP (Individualized Education Program) | 13 specific disability categories |
| Section 504 | 504 Plan | Any disability affecting major life activity |

Speaker notes: Both are federal civil rights protections.

---

## IEP vs. 504 Plan

| Feature | IEP | 504 Plan |
|---------|-----|----------|
| Purpose | Specialized instruction | Accommodations for access |
| Detail Level | Comprehensive (goals, services, placement) | Simpler (disability description, accommodations) |
| Meeting | Annual IEP meeting required | Periodic review |

Speaker notes: IEP students need different instruction; 504 students need same instruction, different access.

---

## Key Vocabulary

- **Accommodation**: Change in HOW a student accesses learning (same expectations)
- **Modification**: Change in WHAT a student learns (different expectations)

Speaker notes: This is a critical distinction.

---

## Common Accommodations

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Presentation | Extended time, larger print, text read aloud |
| Response | Verbal instead of written, use of calculator |
| Setting | Preferential seating, separate testing room |
| Scheduling | Breaks during tests, multiple sessions |

Speaker notes: These don't change WHAT is learned, only HOW it's accessed.

---

## Accommodation vs. Modification

| Accommodation | Modification |
|---------------|--------------|
| Extra time on 20 vocabulary words | Fewer vocabulary words (10 instead of 20) |
| Calculator allowed on math test | Simpler math problems on test |
| Audiobook version of novel | Shorter, adapted version of novel |

Speaker notes: Accommodations = same goal, different path. Modifications = different goal.

---

## What's in an IEP?

- **Present Levels**: Where is the student now?
- **Annual Goals**: What will they work toward?
- **Services**: What support will be provided?
- **Accommodations/Modifications**: What changes to instruction?
- **Placement**: Where will services be delivered?

Speaker notes: IEPs are detailed legal documents.

---

## Your Responsibilities

- Read every IEP and 504 for your students
- Implement accommodations consistently—every day
- Document that you provided accommodations
- Communicate concerns to the special education team
- Attend IEP meetings when invited
- Protect student confidentiality

Speaker notes: Failing to implement is a violation of federal law.

## "That's Not Fair!"

A classmate says: "Why does she get extra time?"

What you CAN say: "Fair means everyone gets what they need to succeed."

What you CANNOT say: Anything about the other student's disability.

Speaker notes: Redirect to general fairness, never disclose individual student information.

---

## Fair Doesn't Mean Same

"Some students wear glasses to see. Some students get extra time to show what they know. We all have different needs."

Speaker notes: This framing helps normalize accommodations.

---

## Quote

"When you provide accommodations, you're not giving an unfair advantage. You're leveling a playing field that was uneven to begin with."

---

## Closing

Before each school year: Request and read every IEP and 504 for students in your classes.

Every day: Implement what those documents require.

Speaker notes: This is both a legal requirement and the right thing to do.
