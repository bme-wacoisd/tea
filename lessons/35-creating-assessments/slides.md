# Creating Assessments That Measure What Matters

Rubrics and Checklists for Clear Expectations

---

## The Grading Problem

Monday: Essay gets a B+
Friday: Similar essay gets a B-

Student asks: "What do you WANT from me?"

Teacher struggles to explain why one is better than the other.

Speaker notes: This inconsistency frustrates everyone and isn't fair to students.

## Two Assessment Tools

| Tool | Format | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| Checklist | Yes/No list | Required elements |
| Rubric | Grid with levels | Quality of work |

Checklist: "Includes thesis statement" ✓
Rubric: "Thesis is clear and arguable" (4) vs. "Thesis is present but vague" (2)

Speaker notes: Both make expectations explicit. Choose based on what you're assessing.

## Anatomy of a Rubric

**Criteria**: The dimensions being assessed (what matters)

**Performance Levels**: Descriptions of quality (how good)

**Descriptions**: What each level actually looks like

Speaker notes: The descriptions are the hard part—they need to be specific enough that two graders would agree.

---

## Building a Rubric: Four Steps

1. **Identify Criteria** - 3-5 things that matter most
2. **Define Levels** - Usually 3-5 levels (4/3/2/1 or Exceeds/Meets/Approaching/Beginning)
3. **Write Descriptions** - Specific behaviors, not vague labels
4. **Test and Refine** - Grade sample work, revise where unclear

Speaker notes: Start with your learning objective. What are the key components?

## Bad vs. Good Descriptions

**Bad (too vague):**
- 4 = Excellent
- 3 = Good
- 2 = Fair
- 1 = Poor

**Good (specific):**
- 4 = Evidence is relevant, sufficient, and explained
- 3 = Evidence is relevant and sufficient but not fully explained
- 2 = Evidence is present but may be insufficient or unexplained
- 1 = Little or no evidence used

Speaker notes: Specific descriptions allow consistent grading and clear feedback.

## The Single-Point Rubric

| Concerns | Proficient | Strengths |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Notes below standard | Describes meeting the standard | Notes exceeding standard |

Benefits:
- Simpler format
- More individualized feedback
- Less constraining

Speaker notes: An alternative format that some teachers prefer.

## Share BEFORE the Assignment

Rubrics aren't just grading tools—they're learning tools:
- Share before students begin
- Review what each criterion means
- Show examples at different levels
- Have students self-assess before submitting

Speaker notes: When students know the target, they hit it more often.

---

## Student-Friendly Language

Teacher version: "Demonstrates sophisticated synthesis of multiple primary sources"

Student version: "Uses information from at least 3 different sources and explains how they connect"

Write rubrics students can understand.

Speaker notes: Create student-friendly versions or write in plain language from the start.

## Closing

When students know the target, they hit it more often.

Rubrics answer "What do you WANT?" before students even have to ask.

Speaker notes: Good assessment tools help students succeed, not just measure their success.
