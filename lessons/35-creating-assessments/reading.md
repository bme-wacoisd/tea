# Creating Assessments That Measure What Matters

When teachers grade student work without clear criteria, something troubling happens. On Monday, an essay might earn a B+. By Friday, the same teacher might give a similar paper a B-. When students ask "What do you want from me?", the teacher struggles to explain exactly why one paper is better than another. This inconsistency frustrates everyone—students feel like they're aiming at a moving target, and teachers know they're being unfair but don't know how to fix it.

The solution is to create assessment tools that make expectations explicit before students begin working. A rubric is a scoring guide that describes both what you're looking for (criteria) and what different levels of quality look like (performance levels). A checklist is simpler—a list of required elements that are either present or absent. Both tools serve the same purpose: they translate vague expectations like "write a good essay" into specific, observable features like "thesis statement is clear and debatable" or "uses evidence from at least three sources."

Building effective rubrics requires careful thought. Start by identifying 3-5 criteria that matter most for the assignment—more than that becomes overwhelming. Then define what each performance level actually looks like. The descriptions should be specific enough that two different teachers, grading the same work, would give it the same score. Vague labels like "Excellent" or "Good" don't help anyone. Instead, describe what excellence looks like: "Evidence is relevant, sufficient, and clearly explained" versus "Evidence is present but may be insufficient or unexplained." The specificity matters.

The most powerful move is sharing your rubric with students before they start working. When students know exactly what you're looking for, they can aim for it. Review each criterion. Show examples of work at different levels. Have students assess their own drafts using the rubric before submitting. The rubric becomes a learning tool, not just a grading tool. When students know the target, they hit it more often—and they stop asking "What do you WANT?" because the rubric tells them clearly.
