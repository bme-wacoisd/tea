## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Present scenario: Same teacher grades same quality essay differently on Monday vs. Friday
- Ask: "Why does this happen? How would you feel as a student?"
- Frame: Good assessment tools solve the consistency problem

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Define key terms: rubric, checklist, criteria, performance levels
- Compare checklists (yes/no) vs. rubrics (levels of quality)
- Walk through rubric-building steps:
  - Identify 3-5 criteria from learning objective
  - Define performance levels (usually 3-5)
  - Write specific descriptions, not vague labels
  - Test on sample work and refine
- Show single-point rubric alternative

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the "translate vague expectations" section for emphasis

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Improve the vague "Organization" rubric criterion
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share improved rubric descriptions from groups
- Discuss student-friendly language rewrites
- Address the "too many criteria" problem

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: When students know the target, they hit it more often
- Rubrics are learning tools, not just grading tools
- Challenge: Draft a rubric for your next observation

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of rubric improvement activity; understanding of rubric vs. checklist distinction
- **Summative**: Quiz on rubric components and best practices

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide rubric template with structure already in place
- **For advanced students**: Research analytic vs. holistic rubrics
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (rubric, criteria, performance, consistent)

## Instructor Notes

Students may have experienced frustration with vague grading. Validate that experience—it motivates learning to do better.

The key insight is that rubrics serve two purposes: they help teachers grade consistently AND they help students know what to aim for. Many teachers treat rubrics as grading tools only and miss the learning opportunity.

Common mistakes to address:
- Too many criteria (overwhelming for students and teachers)
- Vague descriptions ("Good" vs. specific behaviors)
- Not sharing rubrics before the assignment
- Different language for teachers vs. students

The single-point rubric is worth introducing as a simpler alternative that some teachers prefer. It describes "proficient" and leaves space for individual feedback.
