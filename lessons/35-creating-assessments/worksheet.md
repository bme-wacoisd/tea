# Group Discussion: Creating Assessments

## Prompt 1: Rubric vs. Checklist
What's the difference between a rubric and a checklist? When would you use each one? Think of a specific assignment where a checklist would work better than a rubric, and vice versa.

## Prompt 2: Improving Vague Criteria
Look at this vague rubric criterion: "Organization - 4: Excellent, 3: Good, 2: Fair, 1: Poor." What's wrong with this? How would you rewrite the descriptions to make them actually useful for grading?

## Prompt 3: Sharing Before the Assignment
Why should rubrics be shared with students BEFORE they complete an assignment? What might happen if you only show students the rubric after they've turned in their work?

## Prompt 4: Consistency Across Graders
How do rubrics help teachers grade more consistently? Imagine two teachers grading the same set of essays—how does having a detailed rubric help them give similar scores?

## Prompt 5: Too Many Criteria
What happens if you try to assess too many criteria at once? If you could only grade a student presentation on THREE things, what would they be and why?

## Prompt 6: Student-Friendly Language
Here's a rubric criterion written in teacher language: "Demonstrates sophisticated synthesis of multiple primary sources." How would you rewrite this so a 4th grader could understand it? What about an 8th grader?
