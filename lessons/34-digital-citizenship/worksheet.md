# Group Discussion: Digital Citizenship

## Prompt 1: Native vs. Citizen
What's the difference between being a "digital native" (someone who grew up with technology) and being a "digital citizen" (someone who uses technology responsibly)? Can you be one without the other?

## Prompt 2: Modeling Matters
Why is it important for teachers to MODEL digital citizenship, not just teach about it? What happens when teachers violate the rules they teach?

## Prompt 3: Age-Appropriate Teaching
Choose one element of digital citizenship (etiquette, security, literacy, etc.). How would you teach it to elementary students versus high school students? What would change?

## Prompt 4: Teacher's Digital Life
How might a teacher's personal social media use affect their professional life? What should teachers consider about their own digital footprint?

## Prompt 5: The Cyberbullying Scenario
You discover that students in your class are cyberbullying another student—posting mean comments on social media outside of school. What do you do? Is this a school matter if it happened outside school?

## Prompt 6: "If It's Online, It's True"
How do you teach critical evaluation of online sources to students who believe "if it's on the internet, it's true"? What specific strategies or activities would help?
