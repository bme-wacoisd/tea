## Instructor Notes

This topic connects to students' lives immediately. They may have personal experiences with cyberbullying, privacy violations, or managing their digital presence.

The cyberbullying scenario (Prompt 5) raises important questions:
- Is it a school matter if it happened outside school? → Often yes, if it affects the learning environment
- What's the reporting responsibility? → Know your school's policy
- How do you support the victim while addressing the behavior?

On teacher digital footprint: Be direct that what they post publicly can affect employment. This isn't about limiting expression—it's about being intentional.

Model during this lesson: If you search something or share a resource, verbalize your thinking about digital citizenship choices.
