# Digital Citizenship

Teaching Students to Navigate the Online World

## Digital Native vs. Digital Citizen

**Digital Native**: Grew up with technology—knows how to USE it

**Digital Citizen**: Uses technology responsibly, ethically, and safely

Being a native doesn't make you a citizen.

Speaker notes: Skills ≠ wisdom.

## What Is Digital Citizenship?

The responsible, ethical, and safe use of technology—including:
- Protecting yourself and your data
- Respecting others online
- Evaluating information critically
- Understanding consequences of digital actions

Speaker notes: Future teachers must model AND teach this.

## Key Elements

| Element | What It Covers |
|---------|---------------|
| Literacy | Evaluating sources, understanding algorithms |
| Etiquette | Treating others with respect online |
| Security | Passwords, phishing, protection |
| Law | Copyright, privacy, consequences |
| Health | Screen time, digital wellness |

Speaker notes: Mike Ribble's framework identifies nine elements.

## Age-Appropriate Instruction

| Age | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Elementary | Being kind, asking permission, telling adults |
| Middle School | Reputation, cyberbullying, permanence |

Speaker notes: Same concepts, different emphasis.

## Your Digital Footprint

Everything you do online leaves a trail:
- Posts and comments
- Photos and videos
- Searches and sites visited
- Messages and emails

This footprint is permanent and searchable.

Speaker notes: This applies to teachers AND students.

---

## Teaching Through Scenarios

Don't just tell—create dilemmas to discuss:

"A classmate posts something mean about a teacher online. What do you do?"

"You find a website with perfect information but no author. How do you evaluate it?"

Speaker notes: Scenarios develop judgment, not just compliance.

---

## Model Your Thinking Aloud

"Before I share this image, let me check if it's licensed for reuse..."

"I'm removing students' last names from this newsletter for privacy..."

Students learn by watching how YOU make digital decisions.

Speaker notes: What you do teaches more than what you say.

## When Teachers Don't Practice What They Preach

Students notice when teachers:
- Violate copyright they tell students to respect
- Post inappropriately on social media
- Share student information carelessly
- Mock people online

Your behavior IS a lesson.

Speaker notes: Modeling matters.

---

## Cyberbullying Response

When students cyberbully:
- Take it seriously even if it happened "outside school"
- Document what you see
- Report according to school policy
- Support the victim
- Address the behavior with the perpetrator

Speaker notes: It affects the learning environment regardless of location.

## Closing

Model what you teach. Students are watching.

Digital citizenship isn't a single lesson—it's embedded in everything you do with technology.

Speaker notes: Your digital behavior teaches every day.
