# Teaching Students to Navigate the Online World

Students today are often called "digital natives"—they've grown up with smartphones, social media, and constant connectivity. But knowing how to use technology isn't the same as knowing how to use it responsibly, ethically, and safely. Digital citizenship is this broader skill set: the ability to navigate the online world in ways that protect yourself and respect others. Future teachers must both model digital citizenship and explicitly teach it. You can't just tell students to be responsible online; you have to show them what that looks like and create opportunities to practice.

Digital citizenship covers a wide range of areas. Mike Ribble's framework identifies nine elements: access (recognizing that not everyone has equal technology access), communication (appropriate tone and platform choices), literacy (evaluating sources and understanding algorithms), etiquette (treating others with respect online), law (copyright, privacy, consequences), rights and responsibilities (freedoms come with duties), health and wellness (screen time, digital anxiety), and security (passwords, phishing, protecting yourself). Each element requires different teaching approaches for different ages. Elementary students need basics: asking permission, being kind, telling adults about scary content. Middle schoolers need to understand cyberbullying, reputation, and permanence. High schoolers should manage their digital footprint for college and career, understand intellectual property, and engage civically online.

Teaching digital citizenship works best through scenarios, modeling, and authentic practice—not just telling students rules. Present dilemmas: "A classmate posts something mean about a teacher online. What do you do?" Show your own thinking: "Before I share this image, let me check if it's licensed for reuse." Let students create real digital content and reflect on their choices. Most importantly, model what you teach. Students notice when teachers violate the rules they proclaim. How you use social media, how you communicate digitally with families, how you protect student privacy—all of it teaches. Your digital behavior is a lesson every day, whether you intend it to be or not. Digital citizenship isn't a topic for a single lesson; it's a disposition to cultivate across everything you do with technology in your classroom.
