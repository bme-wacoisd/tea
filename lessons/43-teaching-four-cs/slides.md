# Teaching the 4 Cs

Skills for an Uncertain Future

---

## The Challenge

What jobs will exist when today's students are mid-career?

We don't know.

What we DO know: Adaptable thinkers who can collaborate, communicate, and create will thrive regardless of what changes.

Speaker notes: We're preparing students for jobs that don't exist yet.

## The 4 Cs Framework

| Skill | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| Critical Thinking | Analyzing, evaluating, making reasoned judgments |
| Collaboration | Working effectively with diverse teams |
| Communication | Articulating clearly, adapting to audience |
| Creativity | Generating novel ideas, seeing new possibilities |

Speaker notes: These aren't add-ons—they're how we should teach everything.

## Why Content Knowledge Isn't Enough

"Just Google it." Now: "Just ask ChatGPT."

Facts can be looked up. Procedures can be automated.

What CAN'T be replaced:
- Asking the right questions
- Judging what's true
- Working with others
- Seeing possibilities

Speaker notes: These skills require deliberate instruction.

---

## Critical Thinking

Not just "thinking hard"—thinking systematically and skeptically.

Teach students to:
- Analyze arguments (claim, evidence, reasoning)
- Evaluate sources (who wrote this? why?)
- Question assumptions—including their own
- Ask: "What would make me change my mind?"

Speaker notes: Don't tell students what to think. Teach them HOW to think.

---

## Collaboration

Not just "working in groups"—achieving together what no one could alone.

Teach students to:
- Contribute fairly, not dominate or hide
- Resolve disagreements productively
- Be accountable to teammates
- Reflect on process, not just product

Speaker notes: Collaboration requires explicit instruction, not just grouping.

---

## Communication

Not just "talking and writing"—connecting and being understood.

Teach students to:
- Adapt message to audience
- Listen actively
- Use multiple formats (written, spoken, visual)
- Check: "Did my audience understand?"

Speaker notes: Create authentic communication opportunities.

---

## Creativity

Not just "being artistic"—approaching challenges with originality.

Teach students to:
- Generate multiple solutions, not just one
- Take productive risks
- Learn from failure
- Ask "what if" and "what else"

Speaker notes: Every subject can include creative thinking.

---

## Integration, Not Addition

The 4 Cs aren't separate subjects. They're embedded in how you teach everything.

| Subject | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Math | "Solve this three different ways" |
| Science | "Communicate findings to a different audience" |
| History | "Evaluate these conflicting accounts" |
| English | "Collaborate on peer feedback" |

Speaker notes: Don't add more—change how you teach what you already have.

---

## The AI Question

AI can answer questions and generate content.

This makes the 4 Cs MORE important:
- Critical Thinking: AI can be wrong—students must evaluate
- Creativity: AI generates options—humans choose and combine
- Communication: AI writes—humans connect authentically
- Collaboration: AI helps individuals—humans build teams

Speaker notes: Human skills become more valuable, not less.

## Closing

The 4 Cs aren't separate subjects—they're how you teach everything.

Skills for uncertain futures require intentional teaching.

Speaker notes: Embed, don't add. Every lesson is an opportunity.
