## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify and define the 4 Cs (Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Communication, Creativity)
2. Explain why content knowledge alone is insufficient for students' future success
3. Describe how to embed the 4 Cs across subjects rather than treating them as separate add-ons

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask: "What jobs exist today that didn't exist 20 years ago?"
- Follow up: "What skills do those jobs require?"
- Frame: We're preparing students for jobs that don't exist yet

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce the 4 Cs with definitions:
  - Critical Thinking: Analyzing, evaluating, reasoning
  - Collaboration: Working effectively with diverse teams
  - Communication: Articulating clearly, adapting to audience
  - Creativity: Generating novel ideas, seeing new possibilities
- Discuss why content knowledge isn't enough (facts can be looked up)
- Show how 4 Cs are embedded, not added
- Present teaching strategies for each C

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the embedding examples

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Design a lesson activity that embeds one of the 4 Cs
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share lesson activity ideas from groups
- Discuss how AI changes (but doesn't eliminate) the 4 Cs
- Address assessment challenges

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: The 4 Cs aren't separate subjects—they're how you teach everything
- Skills for uncertain futures require intentional teaching
- Challenge: In your next observation, look for 4 Cs teaching

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of embedded lesson activity ideas; understanding of each C
- **Summative**: Quiz on 4 Cs definitions and teaching strategies

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide 4 Cs reference card with definitions and examples
- **For advanced students**: Research P21 framework or World Economic Forum future skills
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (collaborate, critical, novel, articulate)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson connects directly to students' futures—both as teachers and as people living in a rapidly changing world. The 4 Cs framework provides language for skills that matter.

Key misconceptions to address:
- "Critical thinking" doesn't mean "criticizing"—it means analyzing carefully
- "Creativity" isn't just for art class—it applies to every subject
- "Collaboration" requires teaching, not just grouping

The AI angle is increasingly relevant. Students should consider: What can AI do? What can't it do? What human skills become more valuable, not less, when AI can answer factual questions and generate content?

Integration is the key point. The 4 Cs shouldn't be separate lessons or add-ons. They should be embedded in how every lesson is taught. "Solve this problem three different ways" (creativity). "Explain your reasoning to a partner" (communication). "Evaluate these sources" (critical thinking). "Build this together" (collaboration).
