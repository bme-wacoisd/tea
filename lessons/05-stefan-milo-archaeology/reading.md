# Teaching Archaeology and Anthropology Through Stefan Milo

First, let's be precise about what we're studying.

**Archaeology** is the study of the human past through physical remains—the things people left behind. Bones. Tools. Pottery. The ash from ancient fires. If you can dig it up, it's archaeology.

**Anthropology** is broader: the study of humans and human societies, past and present. It asks: What does it mean to be human? How have humans lived, worked, believed, and organized themselves across time and cultures?

**Prehistory** means the time before written records. Most of human existence happened in prehistory—hundreds of thousands of years of living, dying, loving, and inventing, with no one writing any of it down. To know anything about prehistory, we rely on physical evidence. We rely on archaeology.

Stefan Milo makes videos about this world. He has a BA in Archaeology and Anthropology from the University of Sheffield, and he's built a YouTube channel reaching hundreds of thousands of people who want to understand where we came from. His motto is direct: "No Atlantis. No Aliens. No Nonsense."

What makes Milo effective is not just his knowledge—it's how he connects you to the people he studies. When he talks about Neanderthals, he doesn't describe them as "extinct hominins who lived 400,000 to 40,000 years ago." He makes you imagine what it was like to *be* a Neanderthal. Imagine waking up in a cave, ice outside, your family group around you. Imagine making a stone tool with your hands—the same shape your father made, and his father before him. Imagine meeting a different kind of human, one who looked almost like you but not quite.

This is his gift: he makes ancient people real. He talks about their deaths, their injuries, their children. DNA from a 40,000-year-old bone tells us a Neanderthal girl's parents were closely related. What story does that tell about her small, isolated family group? Ancient DNA research has revealed that our ancestors didn't just coexist with Neanderthals and Denisovans—they had children together. We carry their genes today.

The lesson for teachers: facts matter, but connection makes facts live. When you teach about the past, don't just deliver information. Help students imagine being there.
