# Group Discussion: Teaching Archaeology and Anthropology Like Stefan Milo

**Instructions**: Discuss these prompts verbally with your group. One person should take notes summarizing your key points.

## Prompt 1: Defining the Field

Archaeology studies the past through physical remains. Anthropology studies humans and human societies.

**Discuss**: Why does it matter to define these terms precisely at the start of a lesson? What could go wrong if you assume students already know what archaeology means? What other terms would you need to define before teaching about prehistory?

## Prompt 2: Making Ancient People Real

Milo's signature move is helping viewers imagine being an ancient person—not just learning facts about them.

**Discuss**: Pick an ancient human topic (Neanderthals, early farmers, ice age hunters). What specific details would help students imagine actually BEING that person? What did they see when they woke up? What did they eat? What were they afraid of?

## Prompt 3: "No Atlantis, No Aliens, No Nonsense"

Milo insists on academic sources, lists his sources, and marks his opinions clearly.

**Discuss**: Why is rigor especially important when teaching about prehistory? What nonsense claims about ancient humans have you encountered (TV shows, social media)? How would you address it if a student brought up a claim that isn't supported by evidence?

---

## Prompt 4: The Story DNA Tells

Ancient DNA reveals that humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans didn't just meet—they had children together. We carry their genes today.

**Discuss**: How does DNA evidence change how we teach about human evolution? What does it mean for the "us vs. them" way prehistory is sometimes taught? How might this connect to discussions about human diversity today?

## Prompt 5: Adapting for Your Students

Think about the grade level you most want to teach.

**Discuss**: How would you introduce prehistory to a 1st grader? What changes for an 8th grader? What physical objects or visuals could make prehistoric life tangible for your students?

## Prompt 6: Connection Over Content

Milo argues that making students care about ancient people matters more than memorizing dates.

**Discuss**: What's the difference between a student who memorizes "Neanderthals went extinct 40,000 years ago" and a student who wonders what it felt like to be the last Neanderthal? How do you build the second kind of understanding?
