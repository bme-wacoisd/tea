## Texas TEKS Alignment

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 4 | **The student understands the learner and the learning process** - applying learning theory to instruction |
| 5 | **The student understands instructional planning and delivery** - designing appropriately challenging lessons |

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask: "Think about learning to ride a bike. What kind of help did you need at first? How did that help change over time?"
- Brief discussion connecting to the concept of scaffolding
- Introduce the video game analogy: Level 1 is challenging but achievable

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Present the three zones (comfort, ZPD, frustration)
- Introduce Vygotsky and the Zone of Proximal Development
- Explain scaffolding with training wheels metaphor
- Show the "I Do, We Do, You Do" structure

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause to reinforce key concepts (scaffolding, fading, independence)

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Students discuss prompts verbally
- Instructor circulates to facilitate and probe deeper thinking

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share key insights
- Address: How do you find the zone for different students?
- Discuss the difference between helpful scaffolding and doing the work for students

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Aim for the zone—challenging with support
- Challenge: This week, notice when you're in YOUR zone as a learner

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Observation during group discussion; application to real scenarios
- **Summative**: Quiz on key concepts (Google Forms)

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling readers**: Reading passage uses concrete examples; partner reading option
- **For advanced students**: Compare Vygotsky's social view with Piaget's individual view
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (scaffold, zone, proximal, fading)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson should MODEL scaffolded instruction. Start with accessible examples (bike, video games), build to formal concepts, gradually release to student discussion.

The "I Do, We Do, You Do" structure can be demonstrated within this very lesson.
