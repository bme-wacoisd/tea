# Group Discussion: Teaching in the Zone

## Prompt 1: Your Own Experience
Think of something difficult you learned to do—an instrument, a sport, a skill like driving or coding. How did the support you received change as you improved? Who or what provided scaffolding, and when did it fade?

## Prompt 2: Too Hard Without Help
Describe a time when schoolwork felt frustratingly hard with no help available. What happened? What would have helped you succeed—what kind of scaffolding was missing?

## Prompt 3: When to Step Back
How do you know when a student needs more scaffolding versus when they're ready for you to step back? What signs would you look for to know a student is in their zone versus above or below it?

## Prompt 4: Peers as Teachers
Vygotsky said the "more knowledgeable other" doesn't have to be the teacher—it could be a classmate. How might you design activities where students teach each other? What are the benefits and risks of peer scaffolding?

## Prompt 5: Help vs. Doing It for Them
What's the difference between helpful scaffolding and doing the work for the student? How can a teacher provide support without taking over the thinking?

## Prompt 6: Different Zones, Same Classroom
In any classroom, students are at different levels—some need more scaffolding, others need more challenge. How might you figure out where each student's zone is, and how would you teach to different zones simultaneously?
