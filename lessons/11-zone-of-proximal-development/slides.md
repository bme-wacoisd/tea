# Teaching in the Zone

## Slide 1: Title
Teaching in the Zone
Finding the Sweet Spot for Learning

---

## Slide 2: Video Game Analogy
THINK ABOUT VIDEO GAMES
Level 1 is never impossible.
But it's not trivially easy either.
Each level builds on the last.
This is great learning design.

---

## Slide 3: Three Zones
- COMFORT ZONE: What I can do alone (too easy)
- THE ZONE: What I can do with help (just right)
- FRUSTRATION ZONE: What's beyond my reach (too hard)
- The best learning happens in THE ZONE

---

## Slide 4: Vygotsky Quote
"What a child can do with assistance today, she will be able to do by herself tomorrow."
— Lev Vygotsky

---

## Slide 5: Who Was Vygotsky
- Soviet psychologist
- Discovered: learning is fundamentally social
- We don't just develop, then learn
- We learn, and therefore develop
- Called this the "Zone of Proximal Development"

---

## Slide 6: Three Zones Table
| Zone | What It Feels Like | What Happens |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| Comfort (Too Easy) | "I already know this" | Boredom, no growth |
| THE ZONE (Just Right) | "Challenging but doable" | Engagement, growth |
| Frustration (Too Hard) | "I can't do this" | Shutting down, giving up |

---

## Slide 7: Key Insight
Find where help makes the difference.
The zone is the gap between what you can do alone and what you can do with support.

---

## Slide 8: Scaffolding
- Temporary support that enables success
- Like training wheels on a bike
- The goal: remove the scaffold
- As learners improve, support fades
- Independence is always the destination

---

## Slide 9: Scaffolding Comparison
EFFECTIVE:
- Temporary support
- Gradually removed (fading)
- Student does the thinking
- Builds toward independence

INEFFECTIVE:
- Permanent crutch
- Never removed
- Teacher does the work
- Creates dependency

---

## Slide 10: I Do, We Do, You Do
- I DO: Teacher models (full support)
- WE DO: Guided practice together (shared support)
- YOU DO: Independent practice (support removed)
- This IS scaffolding made explicit

---

## Slide 11: More Knowledgeable Other
- The teacher
- A classmate who understands
- A tutor or mentor
- A well-designed resource
- An AI tutor (with limitations)
- Anyone who knows more about THIS task

---

## Slide 12: Finding the Zone Table
| If You See... | The Student Is... | What To Do |
|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Boredom, rushing through | Below their zone | Increase challenge |
| Engaged struggle with progress | IN the zone | Keep going! |
| Frustration, shutdown | Above their zone | Add scaffolding |

---

## Slide 13: Productive Struggle
The right amount of difficulty promotes growth.
Not comfortable. Not crushing.
Challenging with support available.

---

## Slide 14: Finding Each Student's Zone
- Pre-assess before teaching
- Watch for signs of boredom or frustration
- Ask: "What's confusing? What's too easy?"
- Differentiate scaffolds by readiness
- Check in frequently during work

---

## Slide 15: Closing
Aim for the zone.
Not too easy. Not too hard. Just right challenge with support.
