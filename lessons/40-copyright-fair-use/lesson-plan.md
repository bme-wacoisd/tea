## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Show an image from Google Images
- Ask: "Can I use this in my presentation?"
- Reveal: "Freely available" ≠ "free to use"
- Frame: Copyright law applies to teachers too

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Explain copyright basics (automatic protection for original works)
- Present the four factors of fair use:
  1. Purpose and character (educational, transformative)
  2. Nature of original work (factual vs. creative)
  3. Amount used (portion of whole)
  4. Effect on market (does it substitute for purchase?)
- Show what teachers CAN and CANNOT do
- Introduce legal sources:
  - Public domain
  - Creative Commons licenses (CC-BY, CC-BY-NC, CC0)
  - OER repositories

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the "model the behavior" section

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Develop a search strategy for finding legal images
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share search strategies for legal resources
- Discuss the "it's educational" myth
- Address AI-generated content questions

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Respecting creators is legally required and ethically right
- Model what you expect from students
- Challenge: Audit one of your presentations for proper attribution

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of search strategies; understanding of fair use factors
- **Summative**: Quiz on copyright law and legal resources

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide Creative Commons license cheat sheet
- **For advanced students**: Research the TEACH Act for online education
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (copyright, fair use, attribution, license)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson often surprises students—they may not realize how much of their everyday internet use involves copyrighted material. Many assume "it's on the internet, so it's free" or "it's for school, so it's legal."

The four factors of fair use are complex. For this introductory lesson, focus on the big picture: fair use is a defense, not a blanket permission. When in doubt, find alternatives.

Practical emphasis: Show students HOW to search for Creative Commons or public domain images. Search.creativecommons.org, Google Advanced Search (usage rights filter), Unsplash, Pexels, and Wikimedia Commons are all good starting points.

The modeling section is important. Teachers who tell students to cite sources but don't attribute images in their own slides send a contradictory message. Practice what you preach.

AI-generated content is an emerging area with evolving legal questions. Acknowledge uncertainty while emphasizing that the underlying principle—respecting creators and understanding rights—remains constant.
