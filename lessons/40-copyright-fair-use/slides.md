# Copyright, Fair Use, and Finding Legal Resources

What Teachers Need to Know

---

## The Problem

You find a great image on Google Images.
Can you use it in your presentation?

"Freely available" ≠ "Free to use"

Copyright law applies to teachers too.

Speaker notes: Most images online are copyrighted. Someone owns them.

---

## Copyright Basics

When someone creates something original—photo, song, article, video:
- Copyright is automatic
- No registration needed
- The creator controls use
- Copying without permission = infringement

This applies to Google Images, YouTube videos, song lyrics, articles, even student work.

Speaker notes: The internet is full of copyrighted material.

---

## Fair Use: The Exception

Teachers have SOME flexibility under fair use.

But "educational use" doesn't automatically make copying legal.

Fair use is a legal DEFENSE, not a guarantee.

Speaker notes: Many teachers believe education is a free pass. It's not.

---

## Four Factors of Fair Use

| Factor | Favors Fair Use |
|--------|-----------------|
| Purpose | Educational, nonprofit, transformative |
| Nature of work | Factual, published |
| Amount used | Small portion, not the "heart" |
| Market effect | No harm to creator's income |

Speaker notes: All four factors are weighed together.

## What Teachers CAN Do

- Show a video clip for class discussion
- Display an image briefly for instruction
- Quote short passages for analysis
- Make limited copies for classroom distribution

Speaker notes: These are generally acceptable uses.

---

## What Teachers Should NOT Do

- Copy entire textbooks
- Post copyrighted videos to public websites
- Use copyrighted music in publicly shared projects
- Assume "educational" makes everything legal

Speaker notes: These cross the line into infringement.

## Finding Legal Resources

**Public Domain**: No copyright protection
- Expired copyrights, government works
- Project Gutenberg, Library of Congress

**Creative Commons**: Sharing with conditions
- CC-BY: Use with attribution
- CC-BY-NC: Non-commercial only
- CC0: Public domain dedication

**OER**: Open Educational Resources
- Materials created for free educational use

Speaker notes: Abundant legal resources exist—you just need to know where to look.

- OER Commons, OpenStax

Learn to find legal resources—it's a professional skill.

Speaker notes: Make this part of your lesson preparation routine.

## Model the Behavior

If you teach students to cite sources and avoid plagiarism...
You should do the same.

- Credit images in your presentations
- Show students HOW to find legal materials
- Students who see teachers cut corners learn to cut corners

Speaker notes: Your behavior teaches more than your words.

## Closing

Respecting creators is legally required and ethically right.

Model what you expect from students.

Speaker notes: Find legal resources. Give credit. Practice what you preach.
