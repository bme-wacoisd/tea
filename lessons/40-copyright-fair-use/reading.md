# Copyright, Fair Use, and Finding Legal Resources

Teachers need resources—images for presentations, videos for lessons, articles for analysis. The internet has millions of options freely available for viewing. But "freely available" doesn't mean "free to use." When someone creates something original—a photo, a song, an article, a video—copyright protection is automatic. No registration needed. The creator controls how their work is used, and copying without permission is infringement. That image you found on Google? Someone owns it. That YouTube video? Copyright protected. Teachers are not exempt from these laws.

Fair use is a limited exception that allows use without permission for certain purposes—including education. But it's more complex than "educational = legal." Courts consider four factors: the purpose of use (teaching and commentary are favored), the nature of the original work (factual works are more freely usable than creative ones), how much you use (small portions of the whole are favored), and whether your use harms the creator's market (if it substitutes for purchasing the original, that's a problem). Fair use is a legal defense, not a guarantee. Teachers can generally show video clips for discussion, display images for instruction, and quote short passages for analysis. But copying entire textbooks, posting copyrighted videos publicly, or building lessons entirely from others' materials crosses the line.

The good news is that abundant legal resources exist. Public domain works—those with expired copyrights or created by the U.S. government—are free to use. Creative Commons licenses allow creators to share work under specific conditions; CC-BY means use with attribution, CC-BY-NC adds non-commercial restrictions, and CC0 releases work to the public domain. Sites like Unsplash, Pexels, Wikimedia Commons, Project Gutenberg, and OER Commons offer materials explicitly available for educational use. Learning to find these resources is a professional skill.

Finally, model the behavior you expect from students. If you teach them to cite sources and avoid plagiarism, you should do the same. Credit images in your presentations. Show students HOW you found legally usable materials. Students who see teachers cut corners learn to cut corners. Respecting creators isn't just legally required—it's ethically right and pedagogically powerful.
