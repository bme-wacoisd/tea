# Resolving Conflicts in the Classroom

Teaching Students to Resolve Disputes

---

## Conflicts Will Happen

Students argue. Friends fall out. Misunderstandings escalate.

The question isn't whether conflicts occur—it's whether students learn from them.

Speaker notes: Teachers who mediate teach life skills.

## The Four-Step Mediation Model

1. Cool Down
2. Share Perspectives
3. Identify the Problem
4. Generate Solutions

Speaker notes: This structure guides productive conversation.

---

## Step 1: Cool Down

Before productive conversation, emotions must settle.
- Separate students if needed
- Allow time to calm down
- "We'll talk when everyone is ready"

Speaker notes: Skip this step and nothing else works.

---

## Step 2: Share Perspectives

Each person describes what happened from their view.
- One person at a time
- No interrupting
- Teacher paraphrases: "So you're saying..."
- Both feel heard before problem-solving

Speaker notes: People can't move forward until they feel understood.

---

## Step 3: Identify the Problem

Name the actual issue, not just positions.
- What does each person need?
- What's the underlying concern?

Surface arguments often hide deeper issues.

Speaker notes: Positions vs. interests is the key insight.

---

## Positions vs. Interests

Two students want the same seat.

**Position**: "I want that seat."

**Interests might differ**:
- One needs to see the board
- One wants to sit by a friend

Understanding interests opens solutions positions hide.

Speaker notes: This insight changes everything.

---

## Step 4: Generate Solutions

Brainstorm ways to resolve.
- Both parties contribute ideas
- Evaluate options together
- Agree on a specific plan
- Check in later

Speaker notes: Both parties own the solution.

---

## Teacher Role in Mediation

**Do**: Stay neutral, listen actively, paraphrase, ask questions, guide

**Don't**: Take sides, rush to judgment, impose solutions, minimize feelings

Speaker notes: Guide, don't dictate.

---

## Teaching "I" Statements

"You made me feel angry!" → Blaming

"I felt hurt when that happened because..." → Expressing

"I" statements own feelings without attacking.

Speaker notes: Teach this language explicitly.

---

## When Mediation Isn't Appropriate

- **Bullying**: Patterns of power imbalance need intervention
- **Safety threats**: Immediate action required
- **Serious offenses**: Consequences may be needed
- **One party refuses**: Both must be willing

Speaker notes: Mediation is for conflicts between relative equals.

## Closing

The goal isn't just to resolve THIS conflict.

It's to teach skills for resolving FUTURE conflicts—skills they'll use for life.

Speaker notes: Teach resolution, don't just end disputes.
