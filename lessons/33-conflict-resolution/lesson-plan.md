## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Present scenario: Two students both want the same seat. Both say "I want that seat."
- Ask: "How would you resolve this?"
- Collect responses—note who punishes vs. who investigates further

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Present the four-step mediation model
- Explain the teacher's role: neutral, listening, guiding
- Distinguish positions from interests (seat example)
- Introduce "I" statements
- Discuss when mediation isn't appropriate (bullying, safety, serious offenses)

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at the positions vs. interests concept

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key discussion: Transform positions into interests in example scenarios
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share examples of when mediation wouldn't fit
- Discuss the "I didn't start it" response
- Address how these skills serve students in adult life

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Teach conflict resolution, don't just resolve conflicts
- The goal is building lifelong skills, not just ending disputes
- Challenge: Notice conflicts this week and consider how mediation could apply

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of position vs. interest analysis in discussion
- **Summative**: Quiz on four steps, teacher role, and mediation appropriateness

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide four-step mediation model as a reference card
- **For advanced students**: Research peer mediation programs
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (mediation, neutral, perspective, resolution, underlying)

## Instructor Notes

Consider using role-play if time allows. Have two students act out a minor conflict while a third practices mediation.

Common student questions:
- "What if one student won't participate?" → Mediation requires willingness; if one refuses, different approach needed
- "What about consequences?" → Mediation isn't about avoiding consequences—serious offenses still have consequences
- "How do you stay neutral when one student is clearly wrong?" → Your job is to help them see it, not to declare it

The "I didn't start it" response (Prompt 4) is common. Help students see that conflict resolution isn't about assigning blame but about moving forward productively.
