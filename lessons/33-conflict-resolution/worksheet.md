# Group Discussion: Resolving Conflicts in the Classroom

## Prompt 1: Resolution That Worked
Think of a conflict you witnessed—between peers, at home, anywhere—that was handled well. What made the resolution effective? What did the mediator or peacemaker do right?

## Prompt 2: Why Cool Down First?
Why is "cooling down" necessary before mediation can happen? What happens if you try to mediate while emotions are still running high?

## Prompt 3: Position vs. Interest
What's the difference between a student's "position" and their "interest"? Think of a classroom conflict and identify both. How might understanding interests open up solutions that positions hide?

## Prompt 4: "I Didn't Start It!"
A student says, "It's not fair—I didn't start it! Why am I in trouble?" How might you respond? What does this reveal about how the student understands conflict resolution?

## Prompt 5: When Mediation Doesn't Fit
When is mediation NOT the right approach? Describe a situation where you wouldn't use the four-step mediation model. What would you do instead?

## Prompt 6: Skills for Life
How does teaching conflict resolution fit into preparing students for adult life? What situations might they face as adults where these skills matter?
