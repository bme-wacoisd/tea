## Instructor Notes

This topic can feel heavy or scary. Frame it positively: understanding ethics protects future teachers from making mistakes, not just from punishment. The goal is confident, ethical practice.

Use realistic scenarios with genuine tension, not extreme cases. Most students won't encounter dramatic violations, but many will face the gray area situations.

The social media discussion usually generates strong opinions—let students disagree and work through the reasoning. There isn't always one right answer in gray areas, but there are principles to apply.

Be prepared for students who have witnessed boundary violations in their own schooling. Handle disclosures appropriately and refer to counseling if needed.
