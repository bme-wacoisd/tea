# The Professional Boundary

Ethics in Teaching

---

## The Responsibility

Teachers hold enormous power over children's lives.

With that power comes responsibility—and difficult dilemmas without easy answers.

Speaker notes: Teachers spend more waking hours with children than many parents.

---

## Texas Educators' Code of Ethics

- Standard 1: Professional ethical conduct
- Standard 2: Ethical conduct toward colleagues
- Standard 3: Ethical conduct toward students
- Violations can cost you your teaching certificate

Speaker notes: This isn't a suggestion—it's legally binding.

---

## The Three Standards

| Standard | Core Requirements |
|----------|-------------------|
| Toward Profession | Be worthy of trust, honest, comply with law |
| Toward Colleagues | Respect confidentiality, don't make false statements |
| Toward Students | Protect from harm, don't exploit position, maintain confidentiality |

Speaker notes: All three matter—not just conduct toward students.

---

## Clear Lines vs. Gray Areas

| Clearly Unethical | Requires Judgment |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Romantic conduct with students | How much personal info to share |
| Providing alcohol or drugs | Social media friend requests |
| Falsifying grades or records | Giving students your phone number |
| Physical punishment | Attending student events outside school |

Speaker notes: The gray areas are where you need frameworks for thinking.

## Dilemma: The Secret

A student confides they're being bullied but begs you not to tell.

You want to honor trust. But the student is in danger.

**Principle**: Safety trumps confidentiality.

Speaker notes: Explain you must involve help, but you'll support them through it.

---

## Dilemma: The Favor

Your principal asks you to change a grade for a star athlete.

You could lose favor by refusing.

**Principle**: Academic integrity cannot be compromised. Document your refusal and the request.

Speaker notes: Pressure from authority doesn't change what's right.

---

## The Slippery Slope

- Most violations don't start with dramatic bad decisions
- They start with small boundary crossings
- A personal text here, a private joke there
- Until the line is far behind you
- "But I was just trying to help" is a common excuse

Speaker notes: Well-intentioned over-involvement is still a violation.

---

## The Newspaper Test

"Would I be comfortable if this appeared in tomorrow's newspaper?"

Speaker notes: If you'd need to explain or defend the action, reconsider.

---

## When In Doubt

- Ask a mentor or administrator
- Document concerning situations
- Prioritize student safety over other concerns
- Remember: caring about students is good
- Becoming personally entangled is not

Speaker notes: There's always someone to consult—don't go it alone.

---

## The Cost of Silence

Some violations occur because colleagues stay silent.

The professional community has responsibility to address misconduct, even when uncomfortable.

Speaker notes: You have an obligation to speak up.

---

## Key Principles

- Know the Code of Ethics before you teach
- Maintain clear professional boundaries
- Student safety always comes first
- When something feels off, it probably is
- Document, consult, and protect yourself

Speaker notes: These principles protect students AND teachers.

## Closing

Ethics aren't about restricting your teaching.

They're about protecting students—and you.
