# Group Discussion: The Professional Boundary

## Prompt 1: Social Media Dilemma
A student asks to be friends on social media. Walk through your decision-making process. What factors matter? Would your answer be different for different platforms? For different grade levels? What are the risks of accepting? Of refusing?

## Prompt 2: The Caring Teacher Line
Where is the line between being a "caring teacher" who connects with students and inappropriate personal involvement? Can you care too much? What does healthy caring look like versus problematic over-involvement?

## Prompt 3: The Colleague Concern
A colleague tells you something concerning they did with a student—maybe not clearly wrong, but questionable. What are your obligations? Do you talk to them? Report it? Stay silent? What factors affect your decision?

## Prompt 4: Why the Code Exists
Why do you think the Code of Ethics exists? Who does it protect? Some teachers feel these rules restrict their ability to connect with students. How would you respond to that concern?

## Prompt 5: The Slippery Slope
What's an example of a decision that seems harmless but could start a slippery slope toward boundary violations? How do small boundary crossings lead to larger ones?

## Prompt 6: Trust and Boundaries
How do you maintain trust with students while also maintaining professional boundaries? Can you have strong relationships with students while keeping appropriate distance? What does that look like in practice?
