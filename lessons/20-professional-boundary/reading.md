# The Professional Boundary

Teachers hold enormous power. They spend more waking hours with children than many parents do. They make countless decisions that affect students' futures—what to teach, how to encourage, when to push, when to comfort. With that power comes responsibility, and with responsibility come difficult dilemmas. The Texas Educators' Code of Ethics exists not to restrict teachers but to protect everyone: students from harm, teachers from accusations, and the profession from losing public trust. Understanding professional boundaries isn't optional—violations can cost you your teaching certificate and your career.

The Code of Ethics has three standards. The first addresses professional ethical conduct generally: educators must be worthy of public trust, honest in all professional dealings, and compliant with the law. The second addresses conduct toward colleagues: don't reveal confidential information about other educators, don't make false statements, don't interfere with colleagues' rights. The third—and most detailed—addresses conduct toward students: protect them from harm, don't reveal confidential information, don't deliberately distort facts, and never use your professional position for personal benefit. Some lines are clear. Romantic or sexual conduct with students is always wrong, at any age, regardless of consent. Providing alcohol or drugs, falsifying grades, physical punishment—these are unambiguous violations. But many situations fall into gray areas that require judgment.

Consider common dilemmas. A student confides that they're being bullied but begs you not to tell anyone. You want to honor their trust, but they're in danger. The principle: student safety trumps confidentiality. You explain that you must involve help, but you'll support them through the process. Or consider: your principal asks you to change a grade for a star athlete. You could lose favor by refusing—or worse. The principle: academic integrity cannot be compromised. Document your refusal and the request. These scenarios have right answers once you know the underlying principles. Other situations are genuinely ambiguous: How much personal information should you share with students? Should you accept friend requests on social media? Is it okay to give students your phone number? To attend their events outside school? To offer a comforting hug? The "newspaper test" helps: Would you be comfortable if this appeared in tomorrow's newspaper? If you'd need to explain or defend the action, reconsider.

Most ethics violations don't begin with dramatic bad decisions. They start with small boundary crossings that seem harmless—a personal text here, a private joke there, special attention that feels like mentoring. Each small step makes the next one easier until the line is far behind. "But I was just trying to help" is the most common explanation teachers give when they've crossed boundaries. Well-intentioned over-involvement with students' personal lives is still a violation. Caring about students is good and necessary; becoming personally entangled with them is not. The professional relationship is different from a personal one, and that difference protects everyone.

Finally, remember the cost of silence. Some violations occur because colleagues stay silent about misconduct they observe. The professional community has a responsibility to address concerning behavior, even when it's uncomfortable. If you see something wrong—a colleague crossing boundaries, a supervisor making inappropriate requests, another teacher treating students poorly—you have an obligation to speak up through appropriate channels. Know the Code of Ethics before you start teaching. When in doubt, ask a mentor or administrator. Document concerning situations. Prioritize student safety above all other concerns. And remember: ethics aren't about restricting your teaching. They're about protecting students—and protecting you.
