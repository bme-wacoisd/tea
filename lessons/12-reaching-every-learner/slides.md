# Reaching Every Learner

## Slide 1: Title
Reaching Every Learner
Same Destination, Different Paths

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
One classroom. 25 different students.
Some read at 3rd grade level.
Some read at 10th grade level.
"Just teach to the middle?"

---

## Slide 3: Tomlinson Quote
"Differentiation is teaching with an eye on the student, not just on the standard."
— Carol Tomlinson

---

## Slide 4: Tomlinson's Solution
- Don't lower expectations
- Don't teach 25 different lessons
- Adjust the PATH to the same destination
- All students reach high standards
- Different routes to get there

---

## Slide 5: The Metaphor
Same mountaintop. Different trails.
Some take the steep path.
Some take the switchbacks.
Everyone reaches the summit.

---

## Slide 6: Four Things You Can Change
| Element | What It Means | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| CONTENT | What students learn | Same topic, different complexity |
| PROCESS | How they learn it | Different activities for same skill |
| PRODUCT | How they show learning | Essay, video, presentation—choice |
| ENVIRONMENT | Where/with whom | Flexible grouping and seating |

---

## Slide 7: Differentiating Content
- Same concept, different complexity
- All study American Revolution
- Struggling readers: graphic novels, annotated sources
- Advanced readers: original documents, competing interpretations
- Same destination, different texts

---

## Slide 8: Differentiating Process
- Different activities to practice the same skill
- Learning fractions:
- Some use manipulatives (hands-on)
- Some use drawings (visual)
- Some jump to computation (abstract)
- All learn fractions

---

## Slide 9: Differentiating Product
- Choice in demonstrating mastery
- Show understanding of character development:
- Write an essay
- Create a comic strip
- Perform a dramatic monologue
- Record a video analysis

---

## Slide 10: IS vs. IS NOT
IS:
- Same high expectations for all
- Different paths to same goals
- Flexible, responsive grouping
- Based on readiness, interest, profile

IS NOT:
- Lower expectations for some
- More work or less work
- Permanent ability tracking
- Chaos with no shared goals

---

## Slide 11: What Students Bring
- READINESS: Where are they in their learning?
- INTEREST: What topics engage them?
- LEARNING PROFILE: How do they learn best?
- Teachers respond to all three

---

## Slide 12: Tiered Assignment Example
| Tier | Task |
|------|------|
| Tier 1 | Compare characters using this graphic organizer |
| Tier 2 | Compare characters, choosing your organization method |
| Tier 3 | Compare characters across texts, analyzing themes |

---

## Slide 13: AI and Differentiation
AI can differentiate content and process.
But only teachers can know the student, build belonging, and hold high expectations.

---

## Slide 14: Practical Strategies
- Pre-assess to understand where students are
- Build choice into assignments
- Create tiered versions of tasks
- Use flexible grouping (not permanent)
- Vary complexity, not quantity

---

## Slide 15: Closing
Every student can reach the summit.
Your job: ensure the right path exists for each one.
