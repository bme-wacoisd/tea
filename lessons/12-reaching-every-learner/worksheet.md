# Group Discussion: Reaching Every Learner

## Prompt 1: An Eye on the Student
Tomlinson says differentiation is about "teaching with an eye on the student, not just on the standard." What does she mean? How is this different from just covering the curriculum?

## Prompt 2: Your Own Experience
Think of a time you were in a class that moved too fast or too slow for you. What happened? What would have helped? How might differentiation have changed your experience?

## Prompt 3: Content, Process, or Product?
How is changing the "process" different from changing the "content"? How is changing the "product" different from lowering expectations? Give examples of each.

## Prompt 4: The Fairness Question
Some teachers worry differentiation is unfair—"Why does she get to draw while he has to write an essay?" How would you respond to a student who asks this? Is it fair to treat students differently?

## Prompt 5: Knowing Your Students
How might you figure out each student's readiness, interest, and learning profile? What would you look for? What would you ask? How would you keep track of 25 different students?

## Prompt 6: AI and Human Teachers
AI tutors can now adjust content to each student's level in real time. What parts of differentiation does this solve? What parts does it leave untouched? What remains that only a human teacher can provide?
