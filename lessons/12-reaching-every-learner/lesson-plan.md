- Pause to reinforce key concepts

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts

- Instructor circulates to facilitate deeper thinking

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share key insights
- Address the fairness question

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Observation during group discussion; quality of examples generated
- **Summative**: Quiz on key concepts (Google Forms)

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling readers**: Reading passage uses accessible language; partner reading option
- **For advanced students**: Research UDL and compare to Tomlinson's framework
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (differentiate, readiness, tiered)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson should MODEL differentiation. Offer choice in how students share group insights. Provide graphic organizers for those who need them. Allow varied grouping.

The "fairness" discussion is often rich—students have strong opinions about whether treating students differently is fair.
