# Leading Discussions That Make Students Think

Socratic Seminars and Facilitation

---

## The Shift

**Traditional Classroom**: Teachers talk, students listen

**Socratic Seminar**: Students talk, teachers... mostly stay quiet

This is uncomfortable at first. It's also powerful.

Speaker notes: The teacher's role shifts from delivering to facilitating.

## What Is a Socratic Seminar?

Named for **Socrates** (469-399 BCE), who taught by asking questions, not giving answers.

Students:
- Read a shared text beforehand
- Sit in a circle, facing each other
- Respond to each other, not the teacher
- Build ideas through dialogue

Speaker notes: Students discover ideas rather than receive them.

## Seminar Structure

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| Before | Students read/analyze shared text, prepare thoughts |
| During | Circle seating, opening question, student-led dialogue |
| After | Debrief process, connect to learning, individual reflection |

Speaker notes: Preparation is essential—students need something to discuss.

---

## What Teachers DO

- Pose provocative opening questions
- Allow silence (students are thinking)
- Redirect to text: "Where do you see evidence?"
- Invite quiet voices: "Who hasn't spoken yet?"
- Ask follow-up questions: "Why do you think that?"
- Track participation

Speaker notes: Active facilitation, not active talking.

---

## What Teachers DON'T Do

- Give your opinion
- Answer questions directly
- Rescue awkward silences too quickly
- Let one student dominate
- Summarize conclusions
- Force consensus

Speaker notes: Restraint is strategic. Let students do the thinking work.

## Types of Questions

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Opening | Big, open-ended | "Was the character's choice justified?" |
| Follow-Up | Push deeper | "What makes you say that?" |
| Closing | Synthesize | "How has your thinking changed?" |

Speaker notes: Prepare questions, but follow the conversation.

## The Fishbowl Format

**Inner circle**: Active discussants
**Outer circle**: Observers, note-takers

Switch halfway through.

Works well for larger classes—everyone gets a turn.

Speaker notes: Outer circle can provide feedback on discussion quality.

## Student Skills to Teach First

Before Socratic seminars work well, students need:
- Speaking to each other (not the teacher)
- Building on ideas: "I agree with Maria, and also..."
- Respectfully disagreeing: "I see it differently because..."
- Using evidence from the text
- Making space for others

Speaker notes: These skills require explicit instruction and practice.

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Silence | Wait longer than feels comfortable |
| One student dominates | Use talking chips or structured turns |
| Off-topic | Redirect gently to text |
| Wrong answer | Ask follow-up questions; let others respond |

Speaker notes: Most problems come from not waiting long enough.

## Closing

Facilitation means restraint. Let students discover.

Discussion skills must be explicitly taught first.

Speaker notes: Start small. Practice. Trust the process.
