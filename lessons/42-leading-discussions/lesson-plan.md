## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask: "In most classrooms, who does more talking—teachers or students?"
- Introduce the concept of Socratic seminars: students talk, teachers listen
- Frame: This is uncomfortable at first, but powerful

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce Socrates and the questioning method
- Present Socratic seminar structure:
  - Before: Shared text, preparation
  - During: Circle, student-to-student, minimal teacher intervention
  - After: Debrief, reflect
- Review teacher DO's and DON'Ts
- Present question types (opening, follow-up, closing)
- Introduce the fishbowl format
- Discuss student skills needed

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the "strategic restraint" section

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: How to handle incorrect answers without taking over
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share strategies for drawing out quiet students
- Discuss the value of teacher silence
- Practice crafting an opening question

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Facilitation means restraint—let students discover
- Discussion skills must be explicitly taught
- Challenge: Next time you see a discussion, notice the teacher's role

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of opening questions generated; understanding of teacher role
- **Summative**: Quiz on Socratic seminar principles and practices

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide question stems for opening, follow-up, closing
- **For advanced students**: Research Harkness method or accountable talk
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (facilitate, seminar, fishbowl, probe)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson introduces a discussion method that feels counterintuitive—teachers stepping back while students lead. Validate that discomfort while emphasizing the benefits.

The key insight is that teacher restraint creates space for student thinking. When we rush to explain, clarify, or correct, we rob students of the chance to discover.

Common concerns to address:
- "What if they go off-topic?" → Redirect gently to text
- "What if someone is wrong?" → Ask probing questions; let other students respond
- "What if no one talks?" → Wait longer than feels comfortable; silence is thinking time

Practice matters. Socratic seminars work better with practice. Students need to learn discussion skills explicitly—speaking to each other, building on ideas, using evidence, respectfully disagreeing.

The fishbowl format is practical for large classes. Inner circle discusses while outer circle observes and provides feedback. Switch halfway through so everyone participates.
