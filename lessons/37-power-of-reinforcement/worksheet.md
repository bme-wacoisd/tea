# Group Discussion: The Power of Reinforcement

## Prompt 1: Finding the Reinforcer
Think of a disruptive behavior you've seen in a classroom. What was reinforcing it? What was the student getting from the behavior that made it worth continuing?

## Prompt 2: Reinforcement vs. Punishment
Why is positive reinforcement more effective than punishment for long-term behavior change? What are the downsides of punishment-heavy classroom management systems?

## Prompt 3: The Calling-Out Student
A student constantly calls out answers without raising their hand. What might be reinforcing this behavior? How could you reduce it while teaching a replacement behavior?

## Prompt 4: The "Shouldn't Have To" Argument
Some teachers say "I shouldn't have to reward students for doing what they're supposed to do." What's problematic about this thinking? How would you respond?

## Prompt 5: Specific vs. General Praise
Why is specific praise ("I noticed you stayed focused during the entire work period") more effective than general praise ("Good job!")? What makes the difference?

## Prompt 6: Not Taking It Personally
How does understanding reinforcement help you not take student behavior personally? If a student is doing what "works" to get their needs met, what does that tell you about your response?
