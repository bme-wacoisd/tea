# The Power of Reinforcement

How Consequences Shape Behavior

---

## Skinner's Key Insight

"Behavior that gets reinforced gets repeated."

B.F. Skinner (1904-1990) demonstrated that consequences determine whether behavior continues.

We don't need to know what's inside someone's head to change their behavior—we need to understand what happens AFTER the behavior.

Speaker notes: This simple insight explains so much classroom behavior.

## Key Definitions

**Reinforcement**: Consequence that INCREASES behavior
**Punishment**: Consequence that DECREASES behavior

**Positive**: ADDING something
**Negative**: REMOVING something

Note: Positive ≠ good, Negative ≠ bad

Speaker notes: The positive/negative distinction trips people up. It's add/remove, not good/bad.

## The Four Quadrants

| | Add Something | Remove Something |
|--|--------------|------------------|
| INCREASES behavior | Positive Reinforcement (praise, reward) | Negative Reinforcement (remove demand) |
| DECREASES behavior | Positive Punishment (add consequence) | Negative Punishment (remove privilege) |

Speaker notes: All four exist in classrooms. Teachers should rely most on positive reinforcement.

## Accidental Reinforcement

Teachers accidentally reinforce unwanted behavior:
- Student calls out → Teacher responds (attention)
- Student whines → Teacher gives in (gets what they want)
- Student jokes → Class laughs (peer attention)

Ask: "What is this student GETTING from this behavior?"

Speaker notes: This is why the behavior keeps happening!

## The Problem with Punishment-Heavy Systems

Punishment can stop behavior short-term, BUT:
- Doesn't teach what TO do
- Can damage relationships
- May create anxiety or avoidance
- Requires escalation over time
- Only works when the punisher is present

Speaker notes: Reinforcement-based approaches build skills AND relationships.

## Specific, Timely Praise

The most powerful classroom tool:

**General**: "Good job!"
**Specific**: "I noticed you helped Maria understand the directions without being asked."

Be specific: What exactly did they do?
Be timely: Reinforce immediately after the behavior

Speaker notes: Specific praise teaches students what behavior to repeat.

## The Fair Pair

When eliminating a behavior, teach what to do INSTEAD:

| DON'T... | DO... |
|----------|-------|
| Call out | Raise your hand |
| Run | Walk |
| Interrupt | Wait for a pause |

Punishment without replacement creates a vacuum.

Speaker notes: Always pair a "stop" with a "start."

---

## Schedules of Reinforcement

**New behavior**: Reinforce every time (continuous)
**Established behavior**: Reinforce sometimes (intermittent)
**Most persistent**: Unpredictable reinforcement (variable)

Slot machines use variable reinforcement—that's why they're addictive.

Speaker notes: Shift from continuous to intermittent as behavior becomes established.

## Don't Take It Personally

Students aren't being "bad"—they're doing what works.

Your job: Make appropriate behavior work BETTER than inappropriate behavior.

Understanding reinforcement → Understanding behavior → Solving problems

Speaker notes: This reframe helps teachers stay calm and strategic.

## Closing

Students do what works. Make appropriate behavior work better.

This week, catch students being good.

Speaker notes: Shift your attention from catching problems to catching successes.
