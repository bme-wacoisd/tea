# The Power of Reinforcement

Here's a principle that sounds obvious but changes everything when you truly understand it: behavior that gets reinforced gets repeated, and behavior that isn't reinforced eventually fades. What's not obvious is this—teachers accidentally reinforce unwanted behaviors all the time. A student calls out an answer without raising their hand, and the teacher responds. The attention, even negative attention, reinforces the calling out. A student whines about an assignment, and the teacher reduces the workload. Getting what they wanted reinforces the whining. Understanding reinforcement means understanding what students are getting from their behavior.

B.F. Skinner, a Harvard psychologist who studied learning in the mid-20th century, discovered these principles through experiments with animals—and they apply directly to every classroom.

Reinforcement increases the likelihood that a behavior will happen again. It can be positive (adding something desirable, like praise or a privilege) or negative (removing something aversive, like an uncomfortable demand). Punishment decreases behavior—positive punishment adds an unpleasant consequence, while negative punishment removes something desirable. The words "positive" and "negative" don't mean good or bad; they mean adding or removing. This matters because many teachers rely too heavily on punishment-based systems. Punishment can stop behavior in the short term, but it doesn't teach students what TO do instead. It can damage relationships, create anxiety, and requires constant escalation. Reinforcement-based approaches build skills while preserving trust.

The most powerful tool for classroom teachers is positive reinforcement—specifically, specific and timely praise. "I noticed you helped Maria understand the directions without being asked" teaches more than "Good job." Immediate reinforcement works better than delayed reinforcement. When starting a new behavior, reinforce every time; once it's established, shift to intermittent reinforcement to maintain it. Variable reinforcement (unpredictable timing) is most resistant to extinction—which is why slot machines are so addictive and why occasional praise can be more powerful than constant praise.

When you want to eliminate an unwanted behavior, don't just punish it—teach and reinforce the replacement. This is called the "fair pair": for every behavior you want to stop, identify what you want the student to do instead. Don't call out becomes raise your hand. Don't run becomes walk. Don't interrupt becomes wait for a pause. Punishment without a replacement just creates a vacuum. Understanding reinforcement also helps you not take behavior personally—students aren't being "bad," they're doing what works to get their needs met. Your job is to make appropriate behavior work better.
