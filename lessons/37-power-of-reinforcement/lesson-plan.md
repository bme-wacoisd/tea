## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the four quadrants of behavioral consequences (positive/negative reinforcement/punishment)
2. Identify what is reinforcing a given classroom behavior
3. Apply the "fair pair" principle by pairing unwanted behaviors with replacement behaviors

## Texas TEKS Alignment

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| IP 4 | **The student understands the learner** - how behavior is shaped by consequences |
| IP 7 | **The student creates an effective learning environment** - positive behavior supports |
| IP 6 | **The student understands instructional theories** - behaviorist foundations |

## Materials Needed

- Slides presentation (Google Slides)

- Quiz (Google Forms)

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Scenario: Student calls out answer, teacher responds. What just happened?
- Introduce Skinner's key insight: "Behavior that gets reinforced gets repeated"
- Frame: Understanding this helps you work WITH behavior, not against it

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Define key terms: reinforcement, punishment, positive (add), negative (remove)
- Present the four quadrants with examples
- Discuss accidental reinforcement (teacher attention, giving in to whining)
- Introduce specific, timely praise as the most powerful tool
- Present the "fair pair" principle: replace, don't just punish
- Address schedules of reinforcement (continuous vs. intermittent)

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the "fair pair" section for emphasis

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Analyze what's reinforcing a problem behavior
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share analysis of reinforcers from group discussions
- Address the "shouldn't have to reward" objection
- Discuss how understanding reinforcement prevents taking behavior personally

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Students do what works—make appropriate behavior work better
- Reinforcement builds skills AND relationships
- Challenge: This week, catch students being good

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of behavior analysis; understanding of four quadrants
- **Summative**: Quiz on reinforcement principles and applications

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide four quadrants chart as reference
- **For advanced students**: Research Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or token economies
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (reinforcement, punishment, consequences, extinction)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson presents behaviorism as ONE lens, not THE lens. Students may have heard criticisms of behaviorism or feel it's manipulative. Acknowledge these concerns—later lessons explore constructivist alternatives. Both have value.

The "positive = adding" and "negative = removing" distinction often confuses students. Spend time on this—it's not about good/bad.

Common objections to address:
- "I shouldn't have to reward students for doing what they're supposed to do" → External motivation can build habits that become intrinsic; also, adults get paid to do their jobs
- "This seems manipulative" → All teaching involves influencing behavior; the question is whether you do it intentionally and ethically
- "Punishment works" → Short-term yes, but at costs to relationships and long-term change

The "fair pair" concept is practical and memorable. Have students practice it: "Don't run" → "Walk," "Don't call out" → "Raise your hand."
