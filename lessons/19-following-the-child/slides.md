# Following the Child

Child-Centered Education

---

## The Discovery

Children labeled "unteachable" thrived when given freedom within structure.

They chose challenging work. They preferred order to chaos. They repeated activities until mastered.

Speaker notes: This was Montessori's revolutionary finding in the slums of Rome.

## Maria Montessori (1870–1952)

- First female physician in Italy
- Asked to work with "unteachable" children in Rome, 1907
- Observed children instead of imposing lessons
- Developed method through scientific observation

Speaker notes: Her medical training led her to observe children scientifically.

## Quote

"The greatest sign of success for a teacher is to be able to say, 'The children are now working as if I did not exist.'"

— Maria Montessori

## The Prepared Environment

- Child-sized furniture — children can move and reach
- Materials on open shelves — children choose their work
- Mixed-age groups — younger learn from older
- Long work periods — no bells interrupting concentration
- Beautiful, orderly spaces — respect for environment

Speaker notes: The environment itself teaches and supports independence.

## Sensitive Periods

| Period | Age Range | What Children Are Drawn To |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Order | 1-3 years | Routine, predictability, things in their place |
| Language | Birth-6 years | Absorbing vocabulary effortlessly |
| Movement | Birth-4 years | Driven to move and refine motor skills |
| Small Objects | 1-4 years | Fascination with tiny things |

Speaker notes: Teaching during sensitive periods = learning with joy. Fighting them = frustration.

## The Teacher's Role

| Traditional Teacher | Montessori Guide |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Center of attention | Observer of children |
| Delivers content | Prepares environment |
| Decides what's next | Follows child's interest |
| Corrects errors | Materials self-correct |

Speaker notes: The teacher shifts from sage-on-the-stage to guide-on-the-side.

## Quote

"Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed."

— Maria Montessori

---

## Self-Correcting Materials

- Puzzle pieces only fit one way
- Counting materials show when something's wrong
- Children don't need teacher to say "right" or "wrong"
- Builds independence and internal motivation

Speaker notes: The materials provide feedback, freeing the teacher to observe.

## The "Explosion into Writing"

Children using tactile letter materials suddenly, spontaneously began writing.

Not because they were taught. Because they were ready.

Speaker notes: Montessori observed this spontaneous literacy around age 4-5.

## Teacher-Centered vs. Child-Centered

| Teacher-Centered | Child-Centered |
|------------------|----------------|
| Teacher plans lesson on fractions | Fraction materials are available |
| Teacher demonstrates | Child chooses to explore them |
| Students practice at desks | Child discovers relationships |
| Teacher grades papers | Teacher observes, introduces next challenge |

Speaker notes: The child drives the timing; the teacher prepares the opportunities.

---

## Practical Applications

- Observe students before planning lessons
- Create organized, accessible environments
- Build in opportunities for choice
- Design materials that give feedback
- Respect concentration — don't interrupt

Speaker notes: Even in traditional schools, these principles can shift practice.

## Closing

"Following the child" isn't letting them do whatever they want.

It's watching what they're ready for and meeting them there.
