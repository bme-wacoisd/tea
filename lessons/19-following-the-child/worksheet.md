# Group Discussion: Following the Child

## Prompt 1: Observation Before Teaching
Montessori observed children instead of imposing curriculum. What might teachers discover by watching before teaching? What could you learn about your students by simply observing them for a week before planning instruction?

## Prompt 2: The Prepared Environment
What does a "prepared environment" mean for your future classroom, even if you don't use official Montessori methods? How could you design your space to support student independence and choice?

## Prompt 3: The Choice Dilemma
If children choose their own work, how do teachers ensure they learn essential content? What if a child avoids math entirely? How do you balance following the child with meeting required standards?

## Prompt 4: Order and Chaos
Montessori said children prefer order to chaos. Does this match your experience? Why might children—who often seem chaotic—actually crave structure and predictability? What does "order" look like in a classroom?

## Prompt 5: Following vs. Permissiveness
How is "following the child" different from letting children do whatever they want? What's the difference between freedom within structure and no structure at all? Where are the boundaries?

## Prompt 6: Montessori in Public Schools
What aspects of Montessori's approach could work in a traditional public school classroom with 25 students, required curriculum, and standardized tests? What would you have to adapt or let go of?
