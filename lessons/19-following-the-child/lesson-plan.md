- Key discussion: How to balance following the child with required curriculum
- Instructor circulates to push thinking about practical applications

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of discussion about balancing child-centered approaches with requirements
- **Summative**: Quiz on prepared environment, sensitive periods, and Montessori teacher role

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide a Venn diagram comparing traditional and Montessori classrooms
- **For advanced students**: Research public Montessori schools and their outcomes
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (sensitive period, prepared environment, self-correcting)

## Instructor Notes

Model child-centered principles during this lesson: offer choice in discussion prompts, avoid interrupting student thinking, trust students to construct understanding.

The key tension to explore is the practical one: "How do I follow the child when I have required standards and 25 students?" Acknowledge this is genuinely hard while pointing out that even small shifts (more observation, more choice, more independence) can move toward child-centered practice.

The "prepared environment" concept applies even in traditional classrooms—organized materials, accessible resources, spaces for different kinds of work.
