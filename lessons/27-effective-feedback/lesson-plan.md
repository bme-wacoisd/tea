## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Distinguish between evaluative feedback (grades) and descriptive feedback (improvement-focused)
2. Identify characteristics of effective feedback (specific, work-focused, forward-looking, actionable)
3. Transform vague feedback into specific, actionable feedback
4. Evaluate the appropriate roles for AI and human feedback

## Texas TEKS Alignment

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 8 | **The student uses assessment strategies** - providing meaningful feedback |
| 5 | **The student understands instructional planning and delivery** - supporting student learning |

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Show: "B+, Good work!" on a sample paper
- Ask: "What did this student learn from this feedback?"
- Collect responses—highlight the gap between evaluation and learning

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Distinguish evaluative vs. descriptive feedback
- Present the five characteristics: specific, work-focused, forward-looking, actionable, timely
- Share Ruth Butler's research: comments alone beat comments plus grades
- Introduce "Glow and Grow" format
- Address AI's role: strengths, limitations, hybrid model

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at the AI section for discussion

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Transform "Good work!" into specific, actionable feedback
- Instructor circulates, modeling feedback in real time

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share transformed feedback examples
- Discuss the 150-student problem—strategies for efficiency
- Address the AI as tool vs. shortcut question

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Feedback should cause thinking
- The question to ask: "What will the student DO with this feedback?"
- Glow and Grow: a simple structure to start with

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of transformed feedback in discussion; understanding of grades vs. comments research
- **Summative**: Quiz on feedback characteristics, Glow and Grow, and AI roles

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide "Glow and Grow" sentence stems as scaffolds
- **For advanced students**: Explore peer feedback protocols and their design
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (evaluative, descriptive, actionable, forward-looking)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson should MODEL effective feedback. As you circulate during discussion, give specific, forward-looking feedback to groups in real time: "I notice your group is connecting to personal experience—that's making your discussion richer."

Common student reactions:
- "But we have to give grades" → Yes, but consider when and how
- "What if students only care about grades?" → That's partly trained behavior we can shift
- "AI feedback seems like cheating" → Depends on how it's used—is revision cheating?

The AI discussion (Prompt 6) is important and timely. Help students see nuance: AI can be a tool for learning or a shortcut around it, depending on assignment design.

Emphasize that feedback is about relationship too. When you write feedback, you're communicating that you read their work carefully and that they matter.
