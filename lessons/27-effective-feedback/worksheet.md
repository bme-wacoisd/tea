# Group Discussion: Feedback That Moves Learning Forward

## Prompt 1: Feedback That Worked
Think of feedback you received—from a teacher, coach, or mentor—that actually changed how you did something. What made it effective? What did you do differently as a result?

## Prompt 2: The Grade Problem
Research found that students who got comments WITH grades improved no more than students who got grades alone. Why might this be? What happens when a student sees a letter grade on top of written feedback?

## Prompt 3: Person vs. Work
What's the difference between "You're so smart" and "You worked hard on this problem"? Why might one type of praise be more helpful than the other? How does this connect to growth mindset?

## Prompt 4: Making It Specific
Take this vague feedback: "Good work! Keep it up." Imagine it was written on a student's essay about climate change. How would you make it specific and actionable?

## Prompt 5: The 150-Student Problem
A secondary teacher might have 150 students and dozens of assignments. How can teachers give quality feedback when time is limited? What strategies or tools might help?

## Prompt 6: AI as a Feedback Tool
A student uses ChatGPT to get feedback on their draft before submitting it to the teacher. Is this cheating, learning, or something else entirely? How might a teacher design assignments where AI feedback becomes a tool for improvement rather than a shortcut around learning?
