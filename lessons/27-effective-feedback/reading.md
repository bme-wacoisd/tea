# Feedback That Moves Learning Forward

A student submits an essay. The teacher writes "B+" and "Good work!" on top. The student sees the grade, feels okay about it, and moves on. What did the student learn? Nothing about what was good. Nothing about how to improve. Nothing that transfers to the next assignment. Grades communicate evaluation, but feedback should communicate learning. Dylan Wiliam's research is direct: "Feedback should cause thinking." If feedback doesn't make students think and adjust their approach, it's not formative—it's just information.

Effective feedback is specific, not vague. "Good work!" tells a student nothing; "Your introduction hooks the reader with a surprising fact" tells them exactly what worked. "Needs more detail" is vague; "In paragraph 2, explain WHY the character felt angry, not just that she did" is actionable. Effective feedback focuses on the work, not the person. "You're a great writer!" creates a fixed identity; "This essay effectively uses evidence to support each claim" describes what can be replicated. And effective feedback looks forward, not just backward. "Your answer was incorrect" is done; "Next time, check your work by substituting your answer back into the equation" gives a strategy for the future.

Research reveals a surprising problem with grades. Ruth Butler's 1988 study compared three groups: students who got comments only, students who got grades only, and students who got both comments and grades. The comments-only group improved the most. The comments-with-grades group performed no better than the grades-only group. The grade "drowned out" the comments—students looked at the letter and ignored the learning. This doesn't mean you never grade. It means if you want students to actually read and use your feedback, consider separating it from the grade, or giving feedback while they can still revise.

Today's teachers also navigate a new reality: AI can now provide instant feedback. A student can paste an essay into ChatGPT at 2am and get specific suggestions in seconds. AI is tireless, patient, and available—but research shows it grades leniently on weak work and harshly on strong work, misses context about individual students, and can be confidently wrong. The emerging model isn't AI versus humans—it's AI and humans with clear roles. AI handles first-pass revision suggestions and grammar at 2am; humans provide contextual judgment, relationship-based encouragement, and final evaluation. When a teacher writes feedback, they're communicating more than suggestions. They're saying: I read your work. I took time with your thinking. You matter.
