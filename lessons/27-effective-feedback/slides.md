# Feedback That Moves Learning Forward

Giving Feedback That Actually Helps

---

## The Problem

Student submits an essay. Teacher writes: "B+, Good work!"

What did the student learn?
- Nothing about what was good
- Nothing about how to improve
- Nothing that transfers to the next assignment

Speaker notes: Grades communicate evaluation. Feedback should communicate learning.

---

## The Research

Dylan Wiliam: "Feedback should cause thinking."

If feedback doesn't make students think and adjust, it's not formative—it's just information.

Speaker notes: The test: What will the student DO with this feedback?

---

## Evaluative vs. Descriptive Feedback

| Evaluative | Descriptive |
|------------|-------------|
| Judges quality | Tells what to improve |
| "B+" or "Good work!" | "Your introduction hooks with a surprising fact" |
| Answers: How did I do? | Answers: How do I improve? |

Speaker notes: Both have a place—but learning requires descriptive feedback.

## Characteristics of Effective Feedback

- **Specific**: Not "good work" but "your evidence supports each claim"
- **Work-focused**: About the essay, not the student's identity
- **Forward-looking**: What to do NEXT, not just what was done
- **Actionable**: Student knows exactly what to do
- **Timely**: While they still remember and care

Speaker notes: Vague feedback doesn't help anyone.

## Vague → Specific Examples

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Good work!" | "Your thesis clearly states your argument" |
| "Needs more detail" | "Explain WHY the character was angry, not just that she was" |
| "Try harder" | "Check your work by substituting the answer back into the equation" |

Speaker notes: Specific feedback tells students exactly what worked or what to change.

## The Grade Problem

Ruth Butler (1988) compared three groups:
1. Comments only
2. Grades only
3. Comments AND grades

**Surprising result**: Comments-only improved most. Comments-with-grades did no better than grades-only.

The grade "drowns out" the comments.

Speaker notes: Consider separating feedback from grades when possible.

---

## Glow and Grow

A simple structure:

**Glow**: Something specific that worked well

**Grow**: Something specific to improve, with guidance on how

Speaker notes: This format ensures both encouragement and growth direction.

## AI Feedback: Strengths

- Instant and tireless (available at 2am)
- No shame in asking
- Patient repetition
- Good for revision drafts

Speaker notes: AI can handle first-pass feedback when teachers can't.

---

## AI Feedback: Limitations

- Grades leniently on weak work, harshly on strong work
- Misses context about individual students
- Can be confidently wrong
- Can't see effort or growth over time

Speaker notes: AI provides information but misses relationship.

---

## The Hybrid Model

| AI Role | Human Role |
|---------|------------|
| First-pass suggestions | Final evaluation |
| Grammar/mechanics | Contextual judgment |
| Available at 2am | Relationship-based encouragement |
| Tireless revision help | Summative grades |

Speaker notes: Not AI versus humans—AI AND humans with clear roles.

## Closing

When a teacher writes feedback, they're communicating more than suggestions.

They're saying: I read your work. I took time with your thinking. You matter.

Speaker notes: Feedback is relationship as much as information.
