# Group Discussion: Teaching AI Like Andrej Karpathy

**Instructions**: Discuss these prompts verbally with your group. One person should take notes summarizing your key points.

---

## Prompt 1: Defining the Terms

AI, neural networks, deep learning, transformers—these words get thrown around constantly, often incorrectly.

**Discuss**: Before this lesson, how would you have defined "artificial intelligence"? How about "neural network"? Why does it matter to define these terms precisely before teaching about AI? What happens when students (or adults) use these terms without understanding them?

---

## Prompt 2: Building From Scratch

Karpathy doesn't teach AI by showing finished products. He starts with basic math and builds up, piece by piece.

**Discuss**: Think of something you learned by building it yourself versus just using it (a recipe, a skill, a piece of technology). What did building teach you that using didn't? How could "building from scratch" apply to subjects you might teach?

---

## Prompt 3: No Black Boxes

A "black box" is something that works, but you don't know how. Karpathy insists on opening every black box, explaining every step.

**Discuss**: What are examples of "black boxes" in education—things students use without understanding? When is it okay to treat something as a black box? When is it harmful? How do you decide what to unpack versus what to accept as given?

---

## Prompt 4: Simple to Complex

Karpathy starts with the simplest version of a concept before adding complexity. Neural network → layer of neurons → deep network → transformer.

**Discuss**: Think of a topic you might teach. What's the simplest possible version of it? How would you sequence the complexity? What do students need to understand FIRST before anything else makes sense?

---

## Prompt 5: Adapting for Your Students

Think about the grade level you most want to teach.

**Discuss**: You probably won't teach neural networks to 3rd graders—but you might teach them about patterns, or about how practice makes things easier. What age-appropriate concepts connect to AI ideas? How would you introduce "computers can learn" to a young child versus a high schooler?

---

## Prompt 6: The Future You're Preparing Students For

Your students will live and work in a world shaped by AI.

**Discuss**: What do students need to understand about AI to be informed citizens? Is it more important for them to know how AI works technically, or how to think critically about its uses? Both? How would you help students move from users of AI to people who can question and shape it?
