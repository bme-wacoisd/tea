# Teaching AI Research Through Andrej Karpathy

Let's start with what these words actually mean.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) research** is the field of building machines that can do tasks normally requiring human intelligence—recognizing faces, understanding language, making decisions. That's the goal. But how do we get there?

**Neural networks** are one approach. They're inspired by how brains work: billions of simple units (neurons) connected together, where learning happens by strengthening or weakening connections. A neural network is essentially a function that takes inputs (like pixels of an image) and produces outputs (like "this is a cat"), and the "learning" is adjusting millions of numbers until it gets good at the task.

**Deep learning** is neural networks with many layers—"deep" because the information passes through layer after layer, with each layer extracting more abstract features. Early layers might detect edges. Middle layers detect shapes. Later layers recognize faces.

**Transformers** are a specific type of neural network architecture that revolutionized language AI. They process all words in a sentence at once (not one by one) and use "attention" to figure out which words matter most for understanding each other word. ChatGPT, Claude, and most modern language AI are transformers.

Andrej Karpathy is a researcher who taught AI at Stanford, co-founded OpenAI, and led AI at Tesla. But what makes him an exceptional teacher is his philosophy: *build it from scratch*.

When Karpathy teaches neural networks, he doesn't start with frameworks and libraries. He starts with simple math—addition, multiplication, derivatives. Then he builds a single neuron. Then a layer. Then backpropagation (how networks learn). Every piece is transparent. No black boxes.

His YouTube videos have titles like "Let's build GPT from scratch" and "Let's build the tokenizer." He writes every line of code on screen, explaining what it does and why. If something seems like magic, he demystifies it. The goal is not just to use AI tools but to understand how they work.

The lesson for teachers: don't hide complexity. Unpack it, step by step, from the simplest pieces. If you understand how it's built, you understand it.
