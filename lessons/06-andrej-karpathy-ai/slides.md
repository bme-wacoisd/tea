# Slides: Andrej Karpathy — Teaching AI Research

## Planning Notes

This lesson teaches future educators how to approach complex technical topics using Karpathy's method:
- Define terms precisely from first principles
- Build from scratch—no black boxes
- Start simple, add complexity
- Every piece should be transparent

## Slide Flow

1. **Title**: Andrej Karpathy - AI Research From Scratch
2. **Definitions First**: AI, neural network, deep learning, transformer
3. **Who Is He?**: Stanford, OpenAI, Tesla, YouTube
4. **Big Idea**: Build it from scratch
5. **Comparison**: His way vs. the shortcut
6. **Quote**: If you understand how it's built, you understand it
7. **Numbered**: How neural networks learn (5 steps)
8. **Table**: AI terms simplified
9. **Comparison**: Unpack vs. hand-wave (black boxes)
10. **Table**: Adapting for ages
11. **Group Discussion**: Instructions
12. **Closing**: Don't hide complexity

## Color Theme

- Near-black primary (code/terminal aesthetic)
- Teal-cyan for positive
- Green accents (tech/code)
- Red = always negative/don't do this

## Note

This lesson embodies Karpathy's approach: it defines terms precisely at the start and builds understanding piece by piece. No black boxes.
