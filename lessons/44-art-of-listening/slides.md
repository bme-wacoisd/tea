# The Art of Listening

Active Listening for Teachers

---

## The Problem

Most people listen to respond, not to understand.

While someone speaks, they're:
- Mentally preparing their reply
- Formulating their defense
- Planning their next point

This isn't listening—it's waiting for your turn to talk.

Speaker notes: Students, parents, and colleagues notice.

## What Is Active Listening?

**Passive listening**: Hearing words without full engagement

**Active listening**: Fully concentrating on, understanding, and responding to a speaker

The difference determines whether people feel heard or dismissed.

Speaker notes: Active listening is a skill that can be developed.

---

## Physical Signals

- Face the speaker
- Maintain appropriate eye contact
- Adopt open posture
- Nod to show engagement
- Put away distractions (phone, papers)

Speaker notes: Your body communicates whether you're really listening.

---

## Verbal Signals

- Brief encouragers: "I see," "Tell me more"
- Paraphrasing: "So you're saying..."
- Clarifying: "Help me understand..."
- No interrupting

Speaker notes: These signals show you're actively processing.

---

## Mental Engagement (The Hard Part)

- Suspend judgment
- Quiet your internal response-planning
- Focus on understanding, not fixing
- Attend to emotion as well as content

Speaker notes: This is where most people struggle.

## The "Solving Too Soon" Trap

A parent is upset about a grade.

Your instinct: Explain, defend, show the rubric.

But if they don't feel heard first, no explanation satisfies.

**Try**: "I hear how frustrated you are. Tell me more about what happened from your perspective."

Speaker notes: Listen fully before moving to solutions.

## Active Listening Techniques

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Paraphrasing | "So what you're saying is..." |
| Reflecting Feelings | "It sounds like you're frustrated" |
| Clarifying | "Can you say more about...?" |
| Summarizing | "So the main concerns are..." |

Speaker notes: These feel awkward at first but transform conversations.

---

## Common Listening Barriers

- **Multitasking**: Can't fully listen while doing something else
- **Preparing response**: Mental rehearsal blocks reception
- **Judging**: Dismissing message because you disagree
- **Solving too soon**: Jumping to solutions before understanding
- **Emotional reactivity**: Getting triggered and shutting down

Speaker notes: Which barriers affect you most?

## Why This Matters for Teachers

| Relationship | Why Listening Matters |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Students | Feel heard → share more, trust more |
| Families | Feel understood → become partners |
| Colleagues | Feel respected → collaborate better |

Speaker notes: Listening builds every relationship.

## Closing

Listen to understand, not to respond.

People need to feel heard before they can hear solutions.

Speaker notes: Practice paraphrasing this week. Notice the difference.
