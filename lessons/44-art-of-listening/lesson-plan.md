## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask: "Have you ever talked to someone who clearly wasn't really listening? How could you tell?"
- Collect responses about physical and verbal signs of non-listening
- Frame: Listening is a skill—and teachers need it in every relationship

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Define active vs. passive listening
- Present the three components:
  - Physical: Body position, eye contact, no distractions
  - Verbal: Encouragers, paraphrasing, clarifying questions
  - Mental: Suspending judgment, focusing on understanding
- Introduce techniques: paraphrasing, reflecting feelings, clarifying, summarizing
- Discuss the "solving too soon" trap
- Present common listening barriers

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the angry parent example

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Identify personal listening barriers
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share strategies for overcoming listening barriers
- Practice paraphrasing with a volunteer
- Discuss differences in listening to students vs. adults

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Listen to understand, not to respond
- People need to feel heard before they can hear solutions
- Challenge: This week, practice paraphrasing in one conversation

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of barrier identification; understanding of techniques
- **Summative**: Quiz on active listening components and techniques

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide sentence starters for paraphrasing
- **For advanced students**: Research motivational interviewing or coaching techniques
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (paraphrase, empathy, clarify, reflect)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson teaches a skill that seems simple but is surprisingly difficult. Most people overestimate their listening ability.

The "listening to respond vs. listening to understand" distinction is powerful. Have students reflect on which they do more often. Most will realize they spend a lot of mental energy preparing their response.

The angry parent scenario is relevant because students will face it. Emphasize: defensive explaining makes things worse. Listening first—genuinely trying to understand—defuses the situation. Only then can problem-solving begin.

Practice opportunity: Have students pair up and practice paraphrasing. One person shares something (what they did this weekend, a frustration they had). The other listens and paraphrases before responding. This is awkward but educational.

Connect to classroom management: Many conflicts with students escalate because the student doesn't feel heard. Sometimes just saying "It sounds like you're frustrated about..." changes the whole dynamic.
