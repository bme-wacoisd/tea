## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify the key principles of effective instructional materials (alignment, clarity, challenge, purposeful design)
2. Match graphic organizer types to appropriate thinking tasks
3. Apply the materials checklist to evaluate a sample worksheet
4. Describe strategies for adapting found materials

## Texas TEKS Alignment

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 6 | **The student understands instructional planning** - creating instructional materials |
| 7 | **The student evaluates materials** - determining age appropriateness and quality |

## Materials Needed

- Slides presentation (Google Slides)
- Reading handout or projected text
- Worksheet for group discussion
- Quiz (Google Forms)
- Sample worksheets (one cluttered, one clean) for comparison

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Show two versions of the same worksheet: one cluttered with clip art and fonts, one clean and clear
- Ask: "Which would you rather use? Why?"
- Introduce cognitive load: mental resources spent on format vs. content

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Present four principles: alignment, clarity, challenge, purposeful design
- Walk through common material types (graphic organizers, worksheets, visual aids)
- Show which organizer matches which thinking task
- Present the materials checklist
- Discuss adapting vs. creating from scratch

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at the "could a substitute use this?" test for discussion

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Describe how to differentiate a material for different reading levels
- Instructor circulates, providing feedback on responses

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share examples of confusing materials and what made them problematic
- Discuss when graphic organizers help vs. become busywork
- Address professional quality and first impressions

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Every element should serve learning
- Practical tip: Preview materials from the student perspective before using
- Reminder: Your materials reflect your professionalism

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of analysis when discussing confusing materials; ability to match organizers to tasks
- **Summative**: Quiz on principles, organizer types, and adaptation strategies

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide checklist as a reference card for evaluating materials
- **For advanced students**: Evaluate and redesign a cluttered worksheet
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (cognitive load, alignment, scaffold, extraneous)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson should model good design. The slides should be clean, the worksheet should have clear directions, and the materials should exemplify what they teach.

Show actual examples of before/after if possible—a cluttered worksheet vs. its cleaned-up version. This makes the principles concrete.

The differentiation discussion (Prompt 4) is important for understanding Universal Design for Learning. Options include:
- Same objective, simplified language
- Same objective, reduced number of items
- Same objective, added scaffolds (sentence stems, word banks)
- Same objective, different response format

Address the "quiet worksheet" problem: a worksheet that can be completed silently isn't necessarily promoting deep learning. Sometimes the best materials require discussion or explanation.
