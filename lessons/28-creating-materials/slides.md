# Creating Materials That Work

Designing for Learning, Not Confusion

---

## The Problem

A worksheet with clip art everywhere, multiple fonts, crowded text, unclear directions.

Students spend more time figuring out what to DO than actually learning.

Speaker notes: This is a cognitive load problem.

---

## Cognitive Load

Working memory is limited.

When materials are confusing, students spend mental resources on format instead of content.

Good design reduces extraneous load.

Speaker notes: Every unnecessary element competes with learning.

---

## Four Key Principles

- **Alignment**: Material matches the learning objective
- **Clarity**: Students understand what to do within seconds
- **Challenge**: Within zone of proximal development
- **Purposeful Design**: Every element serves learning

Speaker notes: These apply to every type of material.

## Alignment Examples

| Objective | Poor Match | Good Match |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Compare fractions | Identify fractions | Order and explain which is larger |
| Explain causes | List events | Describe why each cause led to the event |

Speaker notes: Material must require the same thinking as the objective.

---

## Clarity Checklist

- Numbered directions
- Adequate white space
- Readable font (minimum 12pt)
- Consistent formatting
- Space for responses

Speaker notes: If you have to explain the worksheet verbally, it's not clear enough.

## Match Organizer to Thinking Task

| Organizer | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| Venn diagram | Comparing two things |
| T-chart | Two categories |
| Sequence chain | Order of events |
| Concept map | Showing relationships |
| KWL chart | Activating prior knowledge |

Speaker notes: Wrong organizer = busywork.

## Visual Aids That Work

- High contrast colors
- Key words, not paragraphs
- Large enough to see from back of room
- Only display what's currently relevant

Speaker notes: Anchor charts are references, not decorations.

---

## Adapt, Don't Just Adopt

Most materials come from somewhere else. Adaptation is essential.

- Simplify complex language
- Break long tasks into chunks
- Add scaffolds (word banks, sentence stems)
- Remove distracting elements

Speaker notes: You don't have to make everything from scratch.

---

## The Checklist

Before using any material, ask:
1. Does it align to my objective?
2. Are directions clear?
3. Is it visually clean?
4. Is the reading level appropriate?
5. Does every element serve learning?

Speaker notes: The "could a substitute use this?" test.

---

## Professional Quality

- No typos or grammatical errors
- Consistent formatting
- Clear visual hierarchy

If materials look sloppy, students (and parents) notice.

Speaker notes: Your materials reflect your professionalism.

---

## Closing

Every element should serve learning—or it shouldn't be there.

Preview materials from the student perspective before using them.

Speaker notes: What you hand students says something about how seriously you take the work.
