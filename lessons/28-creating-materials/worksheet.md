# Group Discussion: Creating Materials That Work

## Prompt 1: Confusing Materials
Think of a worksheet or handout from your own experience that was confusing or frustrating. What made it hard to use? What would have made it better?

## Prompt 2: Adapt or Replace?
You find a worksheet online that's almost what you need, but not quite. How do you decide whether it's worth adapting versus finding or creating something different? What factors influence this decision?

## Prompt 3: Teach or Decorate?
What's the difference between a visual that teaches and a visual that just decorates? Think of an example of each. How can you tell whether an image or graphic is adding to learning or distracting from it?

## Prompt 4: Same Objective, Different Levels
You're teaching a lesson on comparing two characters from a novel. Some students read at grade level; some are below; some are above. How might you differentiate the worksheet or graphic organizer for students at different reading levels while keeping the same learning objective?

## Prompt 5: When Graphic Organizers Help (and Don't)
Graphic organizers like Venn diagrams and T-charts can be powerful tools—but they can also become busywork. When is a graphic organizer genuinely helpful? When might it be unnecessary or even counterproductive?

## Prompt 6: Professional Quality
What does "professional quality" mean when it comes to instructional materials? Why does it matter? What impression do typos, cluttered layouts, or unclear directions give to students and parents?
