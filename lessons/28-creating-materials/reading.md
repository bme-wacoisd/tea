# Creating Materials That Work

A teacher finds a worksheet online. It has clip art everywhere, multiple fonts, crowded text, and unclear directions. Students spend more time figuring out what to DO than actually learning the content. This is a cognitive load problem. Working memory is limited—when materials are confusing, students spend mental resources decoding the format instead of thinking about the content. Well-designed materials reduce this extraneous load. Poorly-designed materials compete with learning.

Effective instructional materials follow several key principles. First, alignment: the material must match the learning objective, not just be "about" the topic. If the objective is "compare fractions," the material must require comparison, not just identification. Second, clarity: students should understand what to do within seconds. This means numbered directions, adequate white space, readable fonts, and consistent formatting. Third, appropriate challenge: materials should fall within students' zone of proximal development—challenging enough to be engaging, not so hard they're frustrating. Fourth, purposeful design: every element should serve learning. No decorative clip art that distracts. Visuals should teach, not just decorate.

Different types of materials serve different purposes. Graphic organizers help students organize thinking—Venn diagrams for comparing, T-charts for categorizing, sequence chains for ordering events, concept maps for relationships. Match the organizer to the thinking task. Visual aids like anchor charts provide reference; keep them simple, high contrast, and visible from the back of the room. Worksheets require especially careful design: number directions clearly, provide adequate space for responses, and consider students who write large or need scaffolds like word banks or sentence stems.

Most materials you use will come from somewhere else—textbooks, the internet, colleagues. Adaptation is essential. Simplify complex language. Break long tasks into chunks. Remove distracting elements. Adjust for your specific students. Before using any material, ask: Does it align to my objective? Are directions clear? Is it visually clean? Does every element serve learning? The "could a substitute use this?" test is useful: if you need to explain the worksheet verbally to make it work, the worksheet isn't clear enough. Your materials reflect your professionalism—no typos, consistent formatting, student-appropriate content. What you hand students says something about how seriously you take the work.
