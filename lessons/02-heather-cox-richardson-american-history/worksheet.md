# Group Discussion: Teaching American History Like Heather Cox Richardson

**Instructions**: Discuss these prompts verbally with your group. One person should take notes summarizing your key points.

---

## Prompt 1: Story First

Richardson says to start with the story—"Who did what? Why did it matter?"—before introducing the abstract principle.

**Discuss**: Pick a historical event you know well (the American Revolution, Civil Rights Movement, etc.). How would you introduce it to students using Richardson's "story first" approach? What specific person or moment would you start with?

---

## Prompt 2: Making History Rhyme

Richardson connects historical events to current headlines. For example, she might connect Reconstruction-era voting debates to modern voting rights discussions.

**Discuss**: Think of a historical topic and a current event that "rhyme." How would you help students see the connection without telling them what to think about it?

---

## Prompt 3: Trusting Students

Richardson says: "If people have true facts in front of them, they will make good decisions. Not necessarily the decisions I would make, but the decisions that make sense for them."

**Discuss**: What does it mean to "trust students with facts"? How is this different from telling students what to conclude? What might be challenging about this approach?

## Prompt 4: Adapting for Your Future Students

**Discuss**: Think about the grade level you're most interested in teaching. How would you adapt Richardson's approach for that age? What kinds of historical "stories" would work? What kinds of "present-day connections" would be appropriate?

---

## Prompt 5: Being Approachable

Richardson is described as "sincere, humble, approachable, and jargon-free." She knows a lot but doesn't "club you over the head" with her expertise.

**Discuss**: Why does being approachable matter for teaching history? How can a teacher be both knowledgeable AND approachable? What behaviors help or hurt?

## Prompt 6: Your Teaching Style

Richardson says: "If you do your job really well, nobody needs you anymore."

**Discuss**: What do you think she means? How does this idea shape the kind of history teacher YOU want to become?
