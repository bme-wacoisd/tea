# Building a Team That Works

Putting people in a room doesn't make them a team. Many so-called teams are just individuals who happen to meet together—they share updates, divide tasks, and go back to working alone. Real teams collaborate, challenge each other, commit to shared goals, and hold each other accountable for results. Patrick Lencioni, a business consultant who studied team failure, found that dysfunctional teams follow a predictable pattern. He identified five dysfunctions that explain why smart, motivated people often fail when working together. Understanding these dysfunctions is the first step to building a team that actually works.

The five dysfunctions build on each other like a pyramid, with the most fundamental at the base. First is absence of trust—not trust in reliability, but trust that makes vulnerability safe. Team members who don't trust each other won't admit mistakes, ask for help, or share struggles. They hide weaknesses instead of addressing them together. Second is fear of conflict. Without trust, teams avoid healthy debate. They maintain artificial harmony, bury disagreements, and let resentment build underground. But healthy teams have passionate disagreements about ideas—they just don't make them personal. Third is lack of commitment. Without real debate, there's no genuine buy-in. Decisions are vague, direction is unclear, and people don't follow through because they never really agreed. Fourth is avoidance of accountability. Without commitment, no one holds others responsible. Low standards become acceptable, mediocrity is tolerated, and high performers become resentful. Fifth, at the top of the pyramid, is inattention to results. Without accountability, individual status and ego matter more than team success. The team fails even when individuals appear to succeed.

Trust is the foundation because everything else depends on it. If you don't feel safe admitting what you don't know, you won't engage in honest debate. If you can't debate honestly, you won't fully commit. If you're not committed, you won't hold others accountable. And if no one's accountable, the team will never achieve collective results. For new teachers, this has immediate implications: being vulnerable about what you don't know—"I'm struggling with this, can you help?"—builds trust faster than pretending you have everything figured out. And in schools full of teams—grade-level teams, PLCs, departments, committees—understanding these dysfunctions helps you contribute to healthy collaboration and recognize when something is going wrong.
