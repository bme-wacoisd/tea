# Building a Team That Works

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

---

## The Problem

Putting people in a room doesn't make them a team.

Many "teams" are just individuals who happen to meet together.

Speaker notes: Real teams collaborate, challenge, commit, and hold each other accountable.

---

## The Five Dysfunctions

A pyramid from bottom (most fundamental) to top:

5. Inattention to Results
4. Avoidance of Accountability
3. Lack of Commitment
2. Fear of Conflict
1. Absence of Trust (Foundation)

Speaker notes: Each dysfunction makes the next one likely.

---

## Dysfunction 1: Absence of Trust

Team members don't feel safe being vulnerable.
- Won't admit mistakes
- Won't ask for help
- Hide weaknesses

**Trust looks like**: "I don't understand this. Can you help me?"

Speaker notes: This is foundational—everything else builds on trust.

---

## Dysfunction 2: Fear of Conflict

Without trust, teams avoid healthy debate.
- Artificial harmony
- Avoid difficult topics
- Resentment builds underground

**Healthy conflict looks like**: Passionate debate about ideas, not personal attacks.

Speaker notes: Conflict about ideas is productive; conflict about people is destructive.

---

## Dysfunction 3: Lack of Commitment

Without conflict, there's no buy-in.
- Vague decisions
- Ambiguity about direction
- Silent disagreement

**Commitment looks like**: "I disagreed, but we decided this as a team and I'm supporting it."

Speaker notes: Real commitment requires real debate first.

---

## Dysfunction 4: Avoidance of Accountability

Without commitment, no one holds others accountable.
- Low standards tolerated
- Mediocrity accepted
- Resentment toward high performers

**Accountability looks like**: "We agreed to this—why isn't it happening?" spoken directly and kindly.

Speaker notes: Avoiding accountability isn't kindness—it's avoidance.

---

## Dysfunction 5: Inattention to Results

Without accountability, ego wins over team goals.
- Personal status over team success
- Department silos
- Team fails while individuals appear to succeed

**Results focus looks like**: "Did OUR students learn?" not "Did MY students learn?"

Speaker notes: This is the ultimate cost of the other dysfunctions.

---

## Signs of Dysfunction

- Meetings feel like a waste of time
- Same issues resurface repeatedly
- People agree in meetings, complain in hallways
- No one addresses poor performance
- "That's not my job" mentality

Speaker notes: These are warning signs.

---

## Signs of a Healthy Team

- Meetings are focused and productive
- Disagreement is open and resolved
- Decisions are clear and followed
- People hold each other accountable
- Results are celebrated collectively

Speaker notes: This is what to aim for.

---

## For New Teachers

Being vulnerable about what you don't know builds trust faster than pretending you have it figured out.

"I'm struggling with this—can you help?" invites collaboration.

Speaker notes: Veteran colleagues respect honesty more than posturing.

---

## Closing

Trust is the foundation. Everything else builds on it.

Be willing to be vulnerable—it builds trust faster than pretending.

Speaker notes: These skills matter every day in schools.
