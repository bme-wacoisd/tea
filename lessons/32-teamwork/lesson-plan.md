## Instructor Notes

Model healthy team dynamics in this lesson. If students disagree during discussion, use it as a teaching moment for healthy conflict.

The "supportive AND honest" discussion (Prompt 5) gets at a real tension. Help students see that caring about someone includes helping them improve—avoiding hard conversations isn't kindness, it's avoidance.

For new teachers: Emphasize that admitting what you don't know builds trust faster than faking confidence. Veteran colleagues respect honesty more than posturing.

Common reactions:
- "I've been on teams like this!" → Use as concrete examples
- "What if the problem is the leader?" → Acknowledge that leaders have extra responsibility for culture
- "Can bad teams be fixed?" → Yes, but it requires addressing the foundational dysfunctions first
