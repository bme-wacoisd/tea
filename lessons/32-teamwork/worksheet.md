# Group Discussion: Building a Team That Works

## Prompt 1: Your Dysfunctional Team
Think of a team you've been on—school group, sports team, job, volunteer work. Which of the five dysfunctions (trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, results) did it struggle with most? How did you see that dysfunction show up?

## Prompt 2: Why Trust First?
Why does trust have to be the foundation? What happens if you try to build commitment or accountability without first establishing trust? Can you skip straight to results?

## Prompt 3: Healthy vs. Destructive Conflict
How is "healthy conflict" different from destructive conflict? What makes passionate debate about ideas productive rather than harmful? What norms or behaviors separate the two?

## Prompt 4: Accountability in Teaching Teams
What might it look like when a teaching team holds members accountable? If one teacher doesn't follow through on a team commitment, how could colleagues address it directly but kindly?

## Prompt 5: Supportive and Honest
How do you balance being a supportive colleague with addressing poor performance? Is it possible to care about someone AND tell them they need to improve? How?

## Prompt 6: The New Teacher's Role
As a new teacher joining an existing team, how might you contribute to a healthy team culture? What should you be willing to do? What should you avoid?
