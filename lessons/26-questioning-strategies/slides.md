# Questions That Make Students Think

Asking Questions That Deepen Learning

---

## The Problem

Teachers ask hundreds of questions daily.

Most require only recall: What's the capital? Who wrote this? What's 7 times 8?

These check memory—but don't build thinking.

Speaker notes: The questions you ask shape the thinking students do.

## The Wait Time Discovery

Mary Budd Rowe found teachers typically wait less than 1 second after asking a question.

When teachers wait 3-5 seconds:
- More students participate
- Answers are longer and more thoughtful
- Students build on each other's ideas

Speaker notes: 3-5 seconds feels awkward but transforms discussions.

## Closed vs. Open Questions

| Closed | Open |
|--------|------|
| Single correct answer | Multiple valid answers |
| Recall or recognition | Thinking and elaboration |
| "What year did WWII end?" | "Why might historians disagree about causes?" |

Both matter—but balance determines thinking depth.

Speaker notes: If you only ask closed questions, students only practice retrieval.

## Question Stems by Bloom's Level

| Level | Question Stems |
|-------|----------------|
| Remember | What is...? Who was...? List the... |
| Understand | Explain why... Summarize... What does this mean? |
| Apply | How would you use...? What example shows...? |
| Analyze | Why do you think...? What's the relationship? |
| Evaluate | Do you agree that...? Which is better and why? |
| Create | What would happen if...? Design a... |

Speaker notes: Plan questions at multiple levels, not just recall.

## The Art of Follow-Up

The first answer is the beginning, not the end.

**Probing deeper**: "Tell me more." "What makes you say that?"

**Extending**: "Who can add to what Maria said?"

**Clarifying**: "What do you mean by...?"

Speaker notes: Follow-up is where real thinking happens.

## Think-Pair-Share

1. **Think**: Silent processing time (everyone)
2. **Pair**: Discuss with a partner
3. **Share**: Report to the class

Every student processes the question—not just the quickest hand-raiser.

Speaker notes: Low-stakes participation for everyone.

## Cold Calling (No Hands Up)

Instead of volunteers, call on students randomly.

Everyone must be ready. Prevents the same five students from dominating.

Not "gotcha"—just equity.

Speaker notes: Normalized over time; initially may feel uncomfortable.

---

## Questions That Shut Down Thinking

- Leading: "Don't you think that...?"
- Gotcha: Asked to catch students off-guard
- Rapid-fire: No time to think between questions
- Self-answered: "What is...? It's _____."

Speaker notes: Watch for these patterns in your own teaching.

## The Wait Time Challenge

Why 3-5 seconds feels hard:
- Feels awkward
- Teachers worry about pacing
- Eager students get impatient
- Silence feels like failure

Why it's worth it:
- More engagement, better answers
- Models that thinking takes time

Speaker notes: Count silently: one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand...

## Transform the Question

"What are the three branches of government?"

becomes

"Why might the founders have divided government into three branches? What were they trying to prevent?"

Speaker notes: Same content, different cognitive demand.

---

## Closing

The questions you ask shape the thinking students do.

Wait. Follow up. Include everyone.

Speaker notes: Challenge: count to 5 after every question this week.
