# Questions That Make Students Think

Teachers ask hundreds of questions every day. But research shows that most of these questions require only recall: What's the capital of Texas? Who wrote Hamlet? What's 7 times 8? These closed questions have their place—checking whether students remember basic facts is useful. But if that's all you ask, students practice retrieval, not thinking. The questions you ask shape the thinking students do. If you want deeper thinking, you need to ask deeper questions.

In the 1970s, researcher Mary Budd Rowe made a remarkable discovery about wait time. She found that most teachers wait less than one second after asking a question before calling on someone or answering it themselves. Less than one second. When she trained teachers to wait 3-5 seconds, remarkable things happened: more students participated, answers became longer and more thoughtful, students built on each other's ideas, and speculative thinking increased. Three to five seconds of silence feels awkward—teachers worry about pacing, eager students get impatient, and silence can feel like failure. But that brief pause signals that thinking takes time and that you expect everyone to engage, not just the quickest hand-raiser.

The best classroom questions move students up Bloom's Taxonomy. Remember-level questions ask for recall: What is...? Who was...? Understand-level questions ask for explanation: Why does...? What does this mean? Apply questions ask students to use knowledge: How would you use this? Analyze questions ask students to examine relationships: Why do you think...? What's the connection between...? Evaluate questions ask for judgment: Do you agree? Which is better and why? Create questions ask students to generate new ideas: What would happen if...? How might you design...? A strong lesson includes questions at multiple levels, moving from checking understanding to pushing thinking.

Effective questioning doesn't stop at the first answer. The first response is the beginning of dialogue, not the end. Follow up by probing deeper: "Tell me more about that." "What makes you say that?" "Can you give an example?" Extend thinking by inviting others in: "Who can add to what Maria said?" "Does anyone see it differently?" Clarify when needed: "What do you mean by that?" "Can you say it another way?" And include everyone by using strategies like Think-Pair-Share—where students think silently, discuss with a partner, then share with the class—so that every student processes the question, not just the volunteers. The questions you ask, and how you handle the answers, determine whether your classroom is a place of thinking or just a place of telling.
