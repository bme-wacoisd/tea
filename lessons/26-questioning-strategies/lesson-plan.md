## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the research on wait time (3-5 seconds) and its effects on student participation
2. Distinguish between closed and open questions
3. Transform a recall-level question into a higher-order thinking question
4. Describe strategies for inclusive questioning (Think-Pair-Share, cold calling)

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask a question and count silently to 5 before calling on anyone
- After the answer, reveal: "That was 5 seconds. Did it feel long?"
- Introduce Mary Budd Rowe's research on wait time

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Present closed vs. open questions with examples
- Walk through Bloom's question stems at each level
- Explain follow-up strategies (probing, extending, clarifying)
- Introduce Think-Pair-Share and cold calling
- Address why wait time is hard but valuable

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Model wait time after key questions in the text

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Transform a Remember question to an Analyze question
- Instructor circulates, modeling follow-up questions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share transformed questions
- Discuss the tension between efficiency and depth
- Address concerns about cold calling

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: The questions you ask shape the thinking students do
- Challenge: Count to 5 after asking questions this week
- Preview: Great questions require great follow-up

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of transformed questions in discussion; awareness of wait time effects
- **Summative**: Quiz on wait time, question types, and inclusive strategies

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide Bloom's question stems as a reference card
- **For advanced students**: Research Socratic seminar questioning techniques
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (wait time, probing, closed, open, convergent)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson should MODEL good questioning. Throughout:
- Wait 3-5 seconds after asking questions (count silently)
- Use follow-up questions rather than moving on after first answers
- Include questions at multiple Bloom's levels

The wait time practice in the opening is essential. Students need to FEEL how long 5 seconds is. It will feel uncomfortably long—that's the point.

When discussing cold calling (Prompt 4), acknowledge student concerns:
- "What if you don't know?" → That's valuable information for the teacher
- "It's stressful" → Reduced over time as it becomes normal
- Emphasize: cold calling is about equity, not "gotcha"

Avoid answering your own questions during this lesson—students will notice if you model the very behavior you're cautioning against.
