# Group Discussion: Questions That Make Students Think

## Prompt 1: Great Questions in Action
Think of a teacher who asked great questions—someone who made you think, not just remember. What did their questioning look like? How did it feel different from typical classroom questions?

## Prompt 2: The Wait Time Challenge
Research shows teachers typically wait less than one second before calling on someone. Why is wait time so hard? How might you practice getting comfortable with 3-5 seconds of silence?

## Prompt 3: Transform the Question
Take this Remember-level question: "What are the three branches of government?" Transform it into an Analyze or Evaluate question that requires deeper thinking about the same content.

## Prompt 4: Cold Calling and Equity
"No hands up" (cold calling) means the teacher calls on students randomly instead of waiting for volunteers. How does this change classroom dynamics? What are the benefits? What concerns might you have?

## Prompt 5: The Answered Question
What message does it send students when teachers answer their own questions? ("What's the capital of Texas? It's Austin.") Why do teachers do this? What's the cost?

## Prompt 6: Balancing Depth and Efficiency
Open questions produce deeper thinking but take more time. Closed questions are efficient but often superficial. How do you balance the need for efficiency with the goal of deeper thinking? When is each type appropriate?
