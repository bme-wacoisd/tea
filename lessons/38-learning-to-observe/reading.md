# Learning to Observe: Watching Teaching in Action

Watching a teacher work looks passive. A student teacher sits in the back of the room, maybe taking a few notes, watching the clock. But skilled observation is entirely different—it's active, focused, and purposeful. The observer is noticing what works, asking why it works, and thinking about how to apply it to their own practice. Future teachers who learn to observe well learn faster than those who just "sit in the back." Observation is a skill, and like any skill, it can be developed.

The key to effective observation is selective attention. You cannot watch everything at once—the teacher's words, the students' responses, the pacing, the transitions, the room arrangement, the materials. Trying to see everything means seeing nothing well. Instead, choose a focus before you enter the room. Maybe you'll watch just how the teacher handles transitions between activities. Maybe you'll track which students participate and which don't. Maybe you'll count wait time after questions. A narrow focus leads to deeper learning than scattered attention.

Observation should be evidence-based, not interpretive. Record what you see and hear, not what you think about it. "Three students were talking during instruction and the teacher didn't address it" is observation. "The teacher doesn't manage behavior well" is judgment. Observation gives you data to work with; judgment closes off learning. The teacher you're watching might have excellent reasons for their choices. When you stay in observation mode, you can ask about those reasons later. When you jump to judgment, you've already decided you know better.

Every observation should lead to reflection: What did I notice? What surprised me? What questions do I have? What will I try in my own teaching? Not every lesson you observe will be excellent—that's okay. Imperfect teaching teaches you what you might do differently. The constraints you see help you understand the realities of teaching. Every classroom has something to teach you if you watch with curiosity rather than evaluation. The observation-reflection cycle—focus, watch, record, reflect, apply—transforms passive watching into active professional learning.
