## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Distinguish between observation (recording what happens) and judgment (evaluating quality)
2. Identify multiple focus areas for classroom observation (teacher actions, student actions, environment, pacing)
3. Apply the observation-reflection cycle to learn from watching other teachers

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask: "What's the difference between watching a movie and analyzing it for film class?"
- Connect to classroom observation: passive watching vs. active observing
- Frame: Observation is a skill that can be developed

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce selective attention: can't see everything, choose a focus
- Review observation targets:
  - Teacher actions (directions, checking understanding, transitions)
  - Student actions (participation, engagement, responses)
  - Environment (arrangement, resources, atmosphere)
  - Timing and pacing
- Distinguish observation from judgment with examples
- Present the observation-reflection cycle

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the observation vs. judgment examples

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Choose a focus area and identify what to look for
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share focus areas and specific observation questions
- Discuss what you can learn from imperfect teaching
- Brainstorm post-observation questions

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Observation is a skill, not passive watching
- Every classroom has something to teach you
- Challenge: Next time you observe, choose one focus and take factual notes

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of observation focus questions; understanding of observation vs. judgment
- **Summative**: Quiz on observation principles and practices

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide observation focus templates with guiding questions
- **For advanced students**: Research lesson study or instructional rounds protocols
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (observation, judgment, selective, reflection)

## Instructor Notes

Students may think observation means just sitting in a classroom. Challenge this—observation is active, focused work.

The observation-judgment distinction is crucial for professional growth. When we judge, we close off learning. When we observe, we gather data we can use.

Some students may have had negative experiences being observed or watching poor teaching. Reframe: you can learn from any classroom if you approach with curiosity. "What would I do differently?" is a valid reflection.

Technology note: Video recording, virtual observations, and AI tools are transforming what's possible. But the fundamental skill—watching purposefully—remains essential.

For the focus area discussion, have students get specific. "Student engagement" is too broad. "How many students are looking at the teacher during direct instruction?" is specific and observable.
