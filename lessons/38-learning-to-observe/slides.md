# Learning to Observe

Watching Teaching in Action

---

## Watching vs. Observing

**Watching**: Sitting in the back, maybe taking notes, watching the clock

**Observing**: Active, focused, purposeful—noticing what works, asking why, thinking about how to apply it

Skilled observers learn faster than those who just "sit in the back."

Speaker notes: Observation is a skill that can be developed.

## Selective Attention

You cannot watch everything at once.
- Teacher's words
- Students' responses
- Pacing and transitions
- Room arrangement
- Materials and resources

Choose ONE focus before you observe.
Narrow focus → Deeper learning

Speaker notes: Trying to see everything means seeing nothing well.

## What to Observe: Teacher Actions

- How do they start class?
- How do they give directions?
- How do they check for understanding?
- How do they handle transitions?
- How do they respond to confusion?
- How do they address misbehavior?

Speaker notes: Pick one of these as your focus.

## What to Observe: Student Actions

- How do students enter the room?
- Who participates? Who doesn't?
- What are students doing during instruction?
- How do students respond to each other?
- What happens when students struggle?

Speaker notes: Student behavior tells you about the effectiveness of teaching.

## What to Observe: Environment and Pacing

**Environment**:
- Room arrangement
- What's on the walls
- Available resources

**Pacing**:
- How long do activities last?
- Are transitions smooth?
- Is there wait time after questions?

Speaker notes: Environment shapes behavior; pacing shapes engagement.

## Observation vs. Judgment

**Judgment**: "This teacher doesn't manage behavior well."

**Observation**: "Three students talked through the instruction. The teacher didn't address it."

Observation gives you data.
Judgment closes off learning.

Speaker notes: The teacher may have excellent reasons for their choices. Stay curious.

## The Observation-Reflection Cycle

1. **Before**: What will I focus on? What do I want to learn?
2. **During**: Record what I see factually
3. **After**: What did I notice? What surprised me? What questions do I have?
4. **Apply**: What will I try in my own teaching?

Speaker notes: This cycle transforms passive watching into active learning.

## Learning from Imperfect Teaching

Not every lesson you observe will be excellent. That's okay.
- What would you do differently? Why?
- What constraints might explain what you saw?
- What can you learn about what NOT to do?

Every classroom teaches you something.

Speaker notes: Approach with curiosity, not criticism.

---

## Post-Observation Questions

After observing, ask the teacher:
- "Why did you choose to...?"
- "What were you thinking when...?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"
- "How did that compare to a typical day?"

Speaker notes: Teachers can explain choices that weren't visible from the back of the room.

## Closing

Observation is a skill, not passive watching.

Every classroom has something to teach you if you watch with curiosity.

Speaker notes: Choose one focus. Take factual notes. Reflect. Apply.
