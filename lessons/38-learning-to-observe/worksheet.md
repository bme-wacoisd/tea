# Group Discussion: Learning to Observe

## Prompt 1: Watching vs. Observing
What's the difference between watching a class and observing a class? What does a skilled observer do that a passive watcher doesn't?

## Prompt 2: Observation vs. Judgment
Why is it important to separate observation (what happened) from judgment (whether it was good)? Give an example of how judgment might prevent you from learning something useful.

## Prompt 3: Choosing a Focus
Pick one focus area: questioning strategies, transitions, student engagement, or feedback. What specifically would you watch for? What questions would you try to answer?

## Prompt 4: Learning from Imperfect Teaching
How might you learn from observing a lesson that didn't go well? What can you gain from watching teaching that has problems?

## Prompt 5: Follow-Up Questions
What questions would you want to ask a teacher after observing their class? Why are post-observation conversations valuable?

## Prompt 6: Technology and Observation
How might video recording change how teachers learn from observation? What can you see in a video that you might miss in a live observation?
