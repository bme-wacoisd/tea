## Instructor Notes

Help students see that familiar features of schools were once radical ideas someone had to fight for. The "normal" is not inevitable—it was created through advocacy and vision.

Consider having students brainstorm: What features of schools today might seem strange or unfair to future generations? What changes might someone fight for next?
