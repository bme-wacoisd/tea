# Group Discussion: The Birth of Public Education

## Prompt 1: Rich and Poor Together
Mann believed rich and poor children should learn together in "common schools." How does this idea play out in American schools today? Are our schools truly "common," or do wealth and neighborhood still determine the quality of education a child receives?

## Prompt 2: Personal Experience Shapes Mission
Mann had only 6-8 weeks of schooling per year as a child. This personal experience drove his mission to ensure no child would face such limited opportunity. How do our own educational experiences shape how we want to teach? What experiences have shaped your vision of what school should be?

## Prompt 3: Who Pays, Who Decides
The idea that education should be "free" is actually about who pays. Taxpayers fund public schools. What does this mean for whose voices matter in education decisions? Who should have a say in what and how children are taught?

## Prompt 4: Why Professional Preparation Matters
Mann created the first "normal schools" to train teachers. Before this, anyone could teach—often teenagers with no preparation. Why does professional preparation matter? What should every teacher know and be able to do before entering a classroom?

## Prompt 5: Democracy Requires Education
Mann said "a republic cannot remain ignorant and free." What did he mean? Is this still relevant today? What role do schools play in preparing citizens for democracy?

## Prompt 6: Importing Ideas
Some criticized Mann for importing "foreign" ideas from Prussia—their professional teacher training and systematic curriculum. When adapting educational ideas from other places or times, what should we keep and what should we adapt? How do we learn from others without losing what makes our approach unique?
