# The Birth of Public Education

## Slide 1: Title
The Birth of Public Education
How One Man Changed American Schools Forever

---

## Slide 2: Setting the Scene
THE YEAR IS 1840
Most American children don't go to school.
Education is for the wealthy. Teaching is not a profession. One man is about to change everything.

---

## Slide 3: Who Was Horace Mann
- Born in poverty in Massachusetts
- Only 6-8 weeks of schooling per year
- Became first Secretary of Massachusetts Board of Education
- Called "The Father of American Public Education"

---

## Slide 4: His Final Words
"Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity."
— Horace Mann

---

## Slide 5: His Radical Idea
Every child deserves free, quality education.
Regardless of social class. This was revolutionary.

---

## Slide 6: What "Common School" Meant
- FREE - No tuition, funded by taxes
- UNIVERSAL - For all children, not just the wealthy
- NON-SECTARIAN - Moral but not religious
- COMMON - Rich and poor learning together

---

## Slide 7: Before and After Mann
| Before 1840 | Mann's Vision |
|-------------|---------------|
| Only wealthy children educated | All children in school |
| Anyone could teach | Trained, professional teachers |
| Private, religious schools | Public, tax-funded schools |
| Education as privilege | Education as right |

---

## Slide 8: Why Professional Teachers?
- Mann created "Normal Schools" - first teacher training
- Before this, teachers were often teenagers
- No standards, no preparation, no profession
- Mann believed: quality schools require quality teachers

---

## Slide 9: Democracy and Education
"A republic cannot remain ignorant and free."
— Horace Mann

---

## Slide 10: Mann's Six Propositions
1. Democracy requires educated citizens
2. Education must be publicly funded and controlled
3. Schools should embrace all children
4. Schools must be moral but non-sectarian
5. Methods must reflect a free society
6. Only trained teachers can deliver this

---

## Slide 11: The Controversial Trip
In 1843, Mann visited Prussia.
He admired their professional teacher training.
Critics accused him of importing "foreign" ideas.

---

## Slide 12: The Debate Continues
Mann's Vision:
- Universal education for all
- Professional teacher training
- Systematic curriculum
- Public funding and oversight

Critics Said:
- Too much government control
- Foreign ideas, un-American
- Parents should decide
- Religious education is best

---

## Slide 13: His Legacy Today
- Free public schools in every American community
- Compulsory attendance laws in all 50 states
- Teacher certification requirements
- The idea that education is a public responsibility

---

## Slide 14: Remember
What seems "normal" was once revolutionary.
Free schools, trained teachers, education for all—someone had to fight for these ideas.

---

## Slide 15: Closing
The schools you teach in exist because of Mann.
