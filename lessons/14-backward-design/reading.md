# Planning Backward from the End

Watch most teachers plan lessons and you'll see a troubling pattern. They start by asking: "What activities sound fun?" or "What content do I need to cover?" Then, almost as an afterthought, they create a test. The result is classrooms full of engaging activities that don't actually teach the objective—students have fun making posters and acting out scenes, but can't demonstrate understanding on the assessment. The test measures different skills than the activities developed. There's no alignment between the destination and the journey.

The solution is a radical flip called "backward design," developed by curriculum researchers Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe. Instead of starting with activities, start with the end: What should students know and be able to DO when this lesson is over? This is Stage 1—identify desired results. Then comes Stage 2: How will you KNOW they can do it? Design the assessment before you plan a single activity. Finally, Stage 3: What experiences will GET students there? Only now do you plan the activities, and you select them specifically because they prepare students for the assessment. As Wiggins put it, "The best designs derive backward from the learnings sought."

Think of it like GPS navigation. When you use GPS, you enter your destination first. The GPS knows what "arrival" looks like—it can tell when you've reached your goal. Then it plans the route to get you there. You wouldn't start driving random directions hoping to end up somewhere good. Yet that's exactly what teachers do when they plan activities before defining the learning goal and its evidence. Backward design means entering the destination first, then letting that destination shape every turn along the route.

Wiggins identified what he called the "twin sins" of lesson design. The first is activity-focused design: "I found this great activity!" The teacher is so excited about the hands-on project that they don't ask whether it actually teaches the objective. The second is coverage-focused design: "I need to get through Chapter 7 this week." The teacher races through content without pausing to ensure students understand. Both sins prioritize the wrong thing—the activity or the content—over student understanding. Backward design keeps the focus where it belongs: on what students will actually learn and how you'll know they learned it.

The practical application is straightforward but requires discipline. Before planning any activities, write the assessment. Ask yourself: "What would students need to DO to prove they understand this?" Then design activities that specifically prepare students for that assessment. Every activity should connect clearly to the objective. If you can't explain how an activity helps students succeed on the assessment, cut it—no matter how fun it is. This alignment between goals, evidence, and activities is the heart of backward design, and it's what separates lessons that look good from lessons that actually work.
