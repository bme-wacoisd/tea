# Planning Backward from the End

Why Great Teachers Start with the Destination

---

## The Problem

Teachers often plan lessons backward—starting with activities instead of goals.

Fun projects that don't prove learning. Tests that measure the wrong things.

Speaker notes: This is the pattern Wiggins and McTighe identified after observing thousands of classrooms.

---

## How Teachers Usually Plan

1. What activities sound fun?
2. What content should I cover?
3. I guess I'll make a test at the end.

Result: engaging activities that don't teach the objective.

Speaker notes: This feels natural but leads to misalignment between what you teach and what you assess.

## Quote

"The best designs derive backward from the learnings sought."

— Grant Wiggins

## Grant Wiggins & Jay McTighe

- Authors of Understanding by Design
- Trained thousands of educators
- Pushed back against "coverage" mentality
- Asked: What should students understand years later?

Speaker notes: Their book UbD has become foundational in curriculum design courses.

## The Three Stages of Backward Design

1. **IDENTIFY DESIRED RESULTS** — What should students know and be able to DO?
2. **DETERMINE ACCEPTABLE EVIDENCE** — How will you KNOW they can do it?
3. **PLAN LEARNING EXPERIENCES** — What activities will GET them there?

Speaker notes: The key insight is designing the assessment before planning activities.

## The GPS Metaphor

| GPS Navigation | Backward Design |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Enter destination first | Identify learning goal first |
| GPS knows when you arrive | Design assessment that shows mastery |
| Then it plans the route | Then plan activities |

Speaker notes: You wouldn't start driving without knowing where you're going.

## The Twin Sins

**Activity-focused design**: "I found this great activity!"
(But does it teach the objective?)

**Coverage-focused design**: "I need to get through Chapter 7."
(But will students understand it?)

Speaker notes: Both sins prioritize the wrong thing over student understanding.

## Misaligned vs. Aligned Planning

| Element | Misaligned | Aligned |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Goal | Teach main idea | Teach main idea |
| Activity | Make posters, act out stories | Identify main idea in passages |
| Assessment | Match vocabulary to definitions | Write the main idea of a new passage |

Speaker notes: Notice how the aligned version has every element pointing toward the same goal.

## Factual Questions vs. Essential Questions

| Closed & Factual | Open & Essential |
|------------------|------------------|
| What is the capital of Texas? | Why do some cities become capitals? |
| Define democracy | Design a fair voting system—defend it |
| List the steps of the water cycle | Explain to a younger student why it rains |

Speaker notes: Essential questions drive inquiry and deepen understanding.

---

## Authentic Performance Tasks

- Don't just ask students to recall
- Ask them to DO something
- Require genuine understanding to succeed
- Show transfer to new situations

Speaker notes: The best assessments reveal whether students can apply their learning.

---

## Practical Steps

- Write the assessment BEFORE planning activities
- Ensure every activity connects to the objective
- Ask: "How will I know students can do this?"
- Design for understanding, not coverage

Speaker notes: These are habits that take practice but transform teaching.

## Closing

You wouldn't drive random directions hoping to end up somewhere good.

Start with where you want students to arrive.
