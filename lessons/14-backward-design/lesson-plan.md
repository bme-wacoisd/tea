## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. List the three stages of backward design in the correct order
2. Explain why assessment should be designed before activities
3. Identify misalignment between objectives, activities, and assessments in lesson examples
4. Describe the difference between activity-focused planning and understanding-focused planning

## Texas TEKS Alignment

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 5 | **The student understands instructional planning and delivery** - designing lessons that align to objectives |
| 6 | **The student understands assessment and evaluation** - designing assessments before activities |

## Materials Needed

- Slides presentation (Google Slides)
- Reading handout or projected text
- Worksheet for group discussion
- Quiz (Google Forms)

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Present a misaligned lesson example: "A teacher wants to teach main idea. She plans poster-making and story acting. Her test asks students to match vocabulary to definitions."
- Ask: What's wrong with this plan?
- Introduce Wiggins and McTighe's solution

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Present the three stages of backward design
- Use the GPS metaphor to make the concept concrete
- Explain the "twin sins" of lesson design
- Show aligned vs. misaligned planning examples
- Demonstrate transformation of factual questions to essential questions

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause to reinforce the GPS analogy

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Groups design an authentic assessment for a topic of their choice
- Instructor circulates to check alignment thinking

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share their authentic assessments
- Discuss why backward design feels unnatural at first
- Address the tension between "fun activities" and "aligned activities"

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: You wouldn't drive without a destination—don't teach without one either
- Challenge: This week, look at your teachers' lessons—can you identify the learning goal?

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of authentic assessments designed during group work; ability to identify misalignment
- **Summative**: Quiz on backward design stages and alignment principles

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide a graphic organizer showing the three stages; use more concrete examples
- **For advanced students**: Analyze a real lesson plan and redesign it using backward design
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (alignment, authentic, assessment, objective)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson should MODEL backward design. Point this out explicitly:
- Our objective: understand backward design
- Our assessment: the quiz (designed first!)
- Our activities: reading, slides, discussion (all prepare for the quiz)

The group activity asking students to design authentic assessments is key—it's where they practice the skill, not just hear about it. Push groups to move beyond recall-based assessments toward genuine performance tasks.
