# Group Discussion: Planning Backward from the End

## Prompt 1: Disconnected Lessons
Think of a lesson you've experienced (as a student) that felt disconnected—activities that were fun but you weren't sure what you learned. What happened? How might backward design have made that lesson more effective?

## Prompt 2: Why It Feels Unnatural
Why do you think teachers often plan activities before assessments? What makes backward design feel counterintuitive at first? What would help a new teacher adopt this habit?

## Prompt 3: Design an Authentic Assessment
Pick a topic you might teach someday (fractions, the water cycle, a historical event, a grammar rule). What would be an authentic performance task—something students DO—that shows real understanding, not just recall?

## Prompt 4: Coverage vs. Understanding
What's the difference between "covering" content and ensuring students "understand" it? Why do schools sometimes prioritize coverage? What's lost when teachers rush through material?

## Prompt 5: How Assessment Shapes Activities
If you design the assessment first, how might that change the activities you plan? Give a specific example: How would knowing the test require X change how you teach?

## Prompt 6: Enduring Understandings
Wiggins talked about "enduring understandings"—ideas students should remember years later, not just until the test. What's an enduring understanding from your own education? What made it stick when other facts faded?
