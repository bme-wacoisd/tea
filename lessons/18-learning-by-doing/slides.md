# Learning by Doing

Why Experience Beats Explanation

---

## The Insight

Children aren't empty vessels to be filled with knowledge.

They're active learners who construct understanding through experience.

Speaker notes: This was Dewey's radical proposition that changed education.

## John Dewey (1859–1952)

- American philosopher and educator
- Opened experimental Lab School in 1896
- Found: students who cooked learned more fractions than worksheet students
- Students who built bridges learned more physics than textbook students

Speaker notes: Dewey tested his ideas in real classrooms with real students.

## Quote

"Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself."

— John Dewey

## Traditional vs. Progressive Education

| Traditional | Progressive |
|-------------|-------------|
| Teachers talk, students listen | Learning through hands-on activities |
| Rigid, predetermined curriculum | Connects to student interests |
| Memorization and recitation | Problem-solving and inquiry |
| Knowledge separated from life | School reflects real world |

Speaker notes: Dewey critiqued the passive model that dominated schools.

## The Experience-Reflection Cycle

1. **CONCRETE EXPERIENCE** — Do something
2. **REFLECTION** — Think about what happened
3. **ABSTRACTION** — Connect to broader principles
4. **APPLICATION** — Try again with new understanding

Speaker notes: This cycle is the heart of experiential learning.

---

## Key Insight

We don't learn from experience alone.

We learn from REFLECTING on experience. Both the doing AND the thinking matter.

Speaker notes: This is often misunderstood—experience without reflection isn't enough.

## Same Content, Different Approach

| Tell First | Do First |
|------------|----------|
| "One-half means one out of two" | "Share these brownies among 8 people" |
| "Write this in your notes" | "Figure out how to cut them fairly" |
| Practice problems after lecture | Concept emerges from the problem |

Speaker notes: The mathematical concept emerges from the problem, not before it.

## The Lab School Experiments

- 6-year-olds built a playhouse
- They learned measurement, carpentry, cooperation
- They didn't learn THESE THINGS to build the house
- They learned them BECAUSE they were building

Speaker notes: The project created the need for the knowledge.

---

## "Messing About" First

- Let students play with magnets before teaching magnetism
- Let students explore water before the water cycle
- Exploration before explanation
- Curiosity before curriculum

Speaker notes: Dewey encouraged letting students explore before formal instruction.

---

## The Question

Despite 100+ years of evidence, most classrooms still use lectures.

It's efficient for teachers. It's familiar. But is it effective for learning?

Speaker notes: Challenge students to think about why "sit and get" persists.

---

## Practical Steps

- Start with problems, not solutions
- Let students explore before formal instruction
- Build reflection into every activity
- Connect lessons to real-world contexts
- Create opportunities for choice and agency

Speaker notes: These are concrete strategies future teachers can use.

## Closing

The best lessons don't begin with explanations.

They begin with experiences worth explaining.
