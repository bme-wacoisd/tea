# Group Discussion: Learning by Doing

## Prompt 1: Your Own Experience
Think of something you learned by doing—cooking, a sport, driving, a musical instrument, a craft. How was that learning experience different from learning by listening or reading? What made the hands-on approach effective?

## Prompt 2: Why Reflection Matters
Dewey said we learn from reflecting on experience, not just from experience itself. Why is reflection necessary? What happens to someone who has many experiences but never stops to think about them?

## Prompt 3: Classroom Challenges
What challenges might a teacher face trying to implement learning-by-doing in a classroom of 25 students? How might you address those challenges? Is experiential learning realistic in today's schools?

## Prompt 4: Redesign a Lesson
Pick a topic typically taught through direct instruction (multiplication, the water cycle, a historical event). How might that lesson look different if designed around experience first, explanation second? Sketch out the basic structure.

## Prompt 5: Schools as Democracies
Dewey envisioned schools as miniature democracies where students make real decisions and solve real problems. What would that look like in practice? What decisions could students actually make? What problems could they actually solve?

## Prompt 6: The Foundational Knowledge Argument
Some argue that students need foundational knowledge BEFORE they can engage in meaningful experiences. You can't explore physics if you don't know basic math. How would Dewey respond to this? Is there a middle ground?
