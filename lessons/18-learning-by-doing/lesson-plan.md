## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Quick activity: Give students a simple puzzle or challenge WITHOUT instructions
- After 2 minutes: "What did you learn? How did you learn it?"
- Connect to Dewey: This is learning by doing

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce John Dewey and the Lab School experiments
- Present traditional vs. progressive education comparison
- Explain the experience-reflection cycle
- Emphasize: experience alone isn't enough—reflection transforms experience into learning
- Show "tell first" vs. "do first" examples

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at the brownies/fractions example to discuss

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Groups redesign a traditional lesson using Dewey's principles
- Instructor circulates to push thinking about practical implementation

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share their redesigned lessons
- Discuss challenges of implementing experiential learning
- Address the "foundational knowledge first" argument

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: The best lessons begin with experiences worth explaining
- Challenge: This week, notice when you learn something by doing vs. by being told

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of lesson redesigns during group work; understanding of experience-reflection cycle
- **Summative**: Quiz on Dewey's principles and experiential learning concepts

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide concrete examples of experiential lessons across subjects
- **For advanced students**: Research project-based learning (PBL) and compare to Dewey's ideas
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (experiential, progressive, constructivism, reflection)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson MUST model experiential learning. The opening activity where students try something without instructions first is essential—it gives them a concrete experience of Dewey's principle before you explain it.

The group redesign activity is the heart of this lesson. Push students to be specific: What would students DO? How would they REFLECT? What concept would EMERGE from the experience?

Be ready to address the practical objection: "This sounds great but how do you do it with 25 kids and limited time?" Acknowledge the challenge while emphasizing that even small shifts toward experience-first design make a difference.
