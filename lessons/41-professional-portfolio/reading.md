# Building Your Professional Portfolio

A portfolio isn't a scrapbook of everything you've ever done. It's a strategic, curated collection of evidence that answers two essential questions: "What can you do?" and "How do you know?" Portfolios serve multiple purposes throughout a teaching career—they help you get hired, meet certification requirements, document professional growth, and reflect on your practice. The key word is "curated." A portfolio with five excellent artifacts and thoughtful reflections is more powerful than one with fifty random items. Quality over quantity, always.

Effective teaching portfolios typically include several categories of evidence. Start with identity—your teaching philosophy statement, resume, and professional goals explain who you are and what you believe about education. Planning artifacts like lesson plans, unit plans, and assessments show you can design effective instruction. Teaching evidence might include video clips, photographs, or de-identified student work samples that demonstrate what happens in your classroom. Professional growth documentation—training records, certifications, conference attendance—shows you're continuously improving. Impact documentation connects your teaching to student outcomes through achievement data or evaluations.

The critical element that transforms a folder into a portfolio is reflection. An artifact alone doesn't speak—you have to explain what it demonstrates. For each item, write a reflection that answers: What skill does this show? Why did I include it? What did I learn from this experience? What would I do differently? A lesson plan without reflection is just paper. A lesson plan with reflection that explains your pedagogical choices, describes what happened when you taught it, and identifies what you'd improve becomes evidence of thoughtful practice.

Start building your portfolio now, not when you need it. Collect artifacts as you create them. Write reflections while experiences are fresh. Organize regularly. A portfolio built over time, with careful selection and continuous updating, is far stronger than one rushed together before job applications. Most educators now use digital platforms—Google Sites, Weebly, WordPress—because digital portfolios can include video, are easily shared via link, and can be continuously updated. But regardless of format, the core skill remains the same: selecting evidence and reflecting on what it shows about your teaching.
