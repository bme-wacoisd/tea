## Prompt 1: Portfolio vs. Folder

## Prompt 2: The Role of Reflection
Why does every artifact need a reflection? What does the reflection add that the artifact alone doesn't provide?

## Prompt 3: Starting Now
What kinds of artifacts could you start collecting now, as a student in this program? What would you want to have when you apply for teaching jobs?

## Prompt 4: First Impressions
A job interviewer asks to see your portfolio. What would you want them to see first? How would you organize it to make the strongest impression?

## Prompt 5: Showing Growth
How do you balance showing your best work with being honest about growth areas? Should a portfolio only include successes?

## Prompt 6: Digital Advantages
Why might a digital portfolio be better for teaching careers than a physical one? What can digital portfolios do that physical ones can't?
