# Building Your Professional Portfolio

Curated Evidence of Your Teaching Competence

---

## What Is a Portfolio?

A portfolio is NOT a scrapbook of everything you've done.

It's a strategic, curated collection of evidence that answers:
- "What can you do?"
- "How do you know?"

Speaker notes: The key word is curated. Quality over quantity.

---

## Why Portfolios Matter

- Job applications (show what you can do)
- Certification requirements
- Professional reflection
- Continuous improvement documentation

A portfolio proves your competence with evidence, not just claims.

Speaker notes: "I'm good at teaching" vs. showing video of your teaching.

## What Goes in a Portfolio?

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Identity | Philosophy statement, resume, goals |
| Planning | Lesson plans, unit plans, assessments |
| Teaching Evidence | Video clips, student work, photos |
| Professional Growth | PD records, certifications, training |
| Impact | Achievement data, evaluations, feedback |

Speaker notes: Organize by category, not chronology.

## The Artifact + Reflection Formula

An artifact alone doesn't speak—you explain what it demonstrates.

**Artifact**: Lesson plan on fractions

**Reflection**: "This lesson demonstrates my ability to [skill]. I designed it to [purpose]. Students [what happened]. In the future, I would [improvement]."

Speaker notes: Without reflection, a portfolio is just a folder.

## Quality Over Quantity

5 excellent artifacts with thoughtful reflections
BEATS
50 random items without context

**Selection criteria**:
- Does this demonstrate a key competency?
- Is this my best work?
- Does this show growth or achievement?
- Can I reflect meaningfully on this?

Speaker notes: Curate carefully. More isn't better.

## Digital vs. Physical Portfolios

| Digital | Physical |
|---------|----------|
| Easily shared via link | Tangible, browsable |
| Can include video/audio | Harder to share remotely |
| Continuously updatable | Challenging to update |
| Searchable and organized | Takes physical space |

Most educators now use: Google Sites, Weebly, WordPress

Speaker notes: Digital is becoming the standard.

## What Hiring Committees Look For

Evidence that you can:
- Plan effective lessons
- Manage a classroom
- Work with diverse learners
- Reflect and grow
- Act professionally

Organize your portfolio to make these easy to find.

Speaker notes: Anticipate what they want to see.

---

## Start Now, Not Later

- Collect artifacts as you create them
- Write reflections while experiences are fresh
- Organize regularly
- Update before you need it

A portfolio built over time is stronger than one rushed before applications.

Speaker notes: Everything you create in this program could be evidence.

## Closing

Start building now. Curate quality. Reflect on everything.

Your portfolio answers: "What can you do? How do you know?"

Speaker notes: This is your professional identity in evidence form.
