## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Show two examples: a messy folder vs. an organized portfolio
- Ask: "What's the difference? Which would you want to show an interviewer?"
- Frame: Portfolios answer "What can you do? How do you know?"

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Define portfolio as curated evidence of competence
- Present categories of artifacts:
  - Identity (philosophy, resume, goals)
  - Planning (lessons, units, assessments)
  - Teaching evidence (video, student work, photos)
  - Professional growth (PD records, certifications)
  - Impact (achievement data, evaluations)
- Introduce artifact + reflection formula
- Compare digital vs. physical portfolios
- Emphasize quality over quantity

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the reflection explanation

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Identify artifacts to start collecting now
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share artifact ideas from groups
- Discuss how to organize for interviews
- Address the "showing growth" question

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Start now, not when you need it
- Quality over quantity—curate, don't hoard
- Challenge: Identify one artifact you can create this week

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of artifact brainstorming; understanding of reflection purpose
- **Summative**: Quiz on portfolio components and best practices

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide reflection template with sentence starters
- **For advanced students**: Research edTPA or National Board portfolio requirements
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (portfolio, artifact, reflection, curated)

## Instructor Notes

Students often wait too long to start portfolios. Emphasize that they can begin NOW. Everything they create in this program could become evidence—lesson plans, reflections, teaching videos, materials they design.

The reflection component is what transforms documentation into evidence. Without reflection, an artifact doesn't demonstrate learning or growth. Practice writing reflections in class.

Practical tip: Google Sites is free and works well for digital portfolios. Show a quick example if possible.

Address the "showing growth" tension. Portfolios can include evidence of improvement—a lesson that didn't work well followed by the revised version with better results shows reflective practice. Hiring committees appreciate honesty and growth mindset.

Connect to job searches: When you interview for teaching positions, you'll want evidence ready. Principals and hiring committees look for proof that you can plan, teach, manage, and reflect. A strong portfolio makes you stand out.
