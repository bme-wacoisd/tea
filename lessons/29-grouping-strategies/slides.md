# Grouping Students for Learning

Intentional Grouping for Maximum Learning

---

## Grouping Is a Teaching Decision

The way you group students affects:
- Who talks
- Who listens
- Who leads
- Who learns

Thoughtful grouping accelerates learning. Careless grouping reinforces inequities.

Speaker notes: Don't default to the same structure every time.

---

## Four Grouping Types

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| Whole Class | Introducing content, building shared knowledge |
| Small Group | Collaborative problem-solving, discussion |
| Pairs | Quick processing, peer support, Think-Pair-Share |
| Individual | Practice, assessment, quiet processing |

Speaker notes: Match grouping to learning goal.

---

## Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous

| Homogeneous | Heterogeneous |
|-------------|---------------|
| Similar ability levels | Mixed ability levels |
| Targeted instruction | Varied perspectives |
| Risk: Permanent tracking | Risk: Some may dominate |
| Risk: Stigma for "low" groups | Benefit: Peer modeling |

Speaker notes: Research generally favors heterogeneous grouping for equity.

## The Problem with Tracking

When groups become permanent:
- Students are locked into identities
- "Low" groups receive less challenging content
- Self-fulfilling prophecies develop
- Inequities are reinforced

Speaker notes: Ability isn't fixed. Groups shouldn't be either.

---

## Flexible Grouping

Groups change based on the task.

- A student might be in a support group for reading and advanced group for math
- Groups reform regularly
- No permanent "high" and "low" identities

Speaker notes: This requires knowing students well—but it's worth it.

---

## Making Groups Work: Roles

Assign roles so everyone contributes:

- **Facilitator**: Keeps group on task
- **Recorder**: Documents group thinking
- **Reporter**: Shares with class
- **Timekeeper**: Monitors time

Rotate roles so everyone practices different skills.

Speaker notes: Without roles, one person often dominates.

---

## Making Groups Work: Expectations

Students need to know:
- What the task is
- How long they have
- What the product looks like
- How they'll be accountable

Speaker notes: Clear structure prevents confusion and off-task behavior.

---

## Monitoring During Group Work

While groups work, teachers should:
- Circulate the room
- Listen to discussions
- Ask probing questions
- Redirect off-task groups
- Take notes on understanding

Speaker notes: Group work isn't a break for the teacher.

---

## Individual Accountability

Group work can hide individual non-learning.

Build in accountability:
- Random reporter (anyone might share)
- Individual reflection after group work
- Each person submits their own thinking

Speaker notes: Every student should think, not just the most eager.

---

## The "One Person Does All the Work" Problem

This happens when:
- The task could be done by one person
- There's no individual accountability
- Roles aren't assigned

Solution: Design tasks that require multiple contributions.

Speaker notes: Jigsaw method is a good example.

---

## Closing

Match grouping to learning goal. Keep groups flexible.

Every student—not just the most capable—should be pushed to think, contribute, and learn.

Speaker notes: Grouping is one of your most powerful instructional decisions.
