# Group Discussion: Grouping Students for Learning

## Prompt 1: One Person Does All the Work
Think of a time you were in a group where one person did most of the work while others coasted. What went wrong? What structures or teacher moves could have prevented this?

## Prompt 2: The Ability Grouping Debate
What are the arguments FOR ability grouping (students of similar level together)? What are the arguments AGAINST it? Where do you personally stand, and why?

## Prompt 3: Different Tasks, Different Groups
How might you group students differently for a class discussion versus a hands-on science project versus independent reading? Why would the grouping change?

## Prompt 4: The Quiet Student
A student never speaks during whole-class discussions but comes alive in small groups. What does this tell you about the relationship between grouping and participation? How might you use this information?

## Prompt 5: Individual Accountability
How do you ensure every student contributes in group work—not just the most confident or capable? What strategies prevent some students from hiding while others do all the thinking?

## Prompt 6: Flexible vs. Fixed
What's the difference between "flexible grouping" and "tracking"? Why does it matter whether groups change regularly or stay the same all year?
