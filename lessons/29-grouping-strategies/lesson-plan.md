## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify when to use each grouping type (whole class, small group, pairs, individual)
2. Distinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous grouping and their implications
3. Explain the concept of flexible grouping and why it matters
4. Describe strategies for building individual accountability in group work

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask: "Think of a time you were in a group where one person did all the work. What went wrong?"
- Collect responses—note common themes
- Introduce: Grouping is a teaching decision, not a default

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Present four grouping types: whole class, small group, pairs, individual
- Compare homogeneous vs. heterogeneous grouping
- Explain flexible grouping and why permanent tracking is problematic
- Present strategies: roles, expectations, monitoring, accountability

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at the flexible grouping concept for emphasis

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students) to model grouping
- Assign roles: facilitator, recorder, reporter
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Instructor circulates, modeling monitoring behavior
- Use random reporter to share out

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Discuss the ability grouping debate—pros and cons
- Share strategies for individual accountability
- Reflect on how the discussion itself modeled good grouping

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Match grouping to learning goal; keep groups flexible
- Practical takeaway: Every student should be pushed to think, not just the most eager
- Preview: Grouping is one tool for differentiation

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of participation in discussion; understanding of flexible grouping concept
- **Summative**: Quiz on grouping types, accountability strategies, and flexible grouping

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide role cards with descriptions of each group role
- **For advanced students**: Research jigsaw method or Complex Instruction
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (homogeneous, heterogeneous, flexible, accountability)

## Instructor Notes

Model good grouping practices in this lesson. Use small groups with assigned roles. Circulate actively. Call on a random reporter rather than volunteers. Demonstrate what you're teaching.

The ability grouping debate (Prompt 2) can generate strong opinions. Avoid false dichotomy—acknowledge that both approaches have merits and that implementation quality matters more than structure.

Address the practical challenge: flexible grouping requires more teacher knowledge and planning than static groups. Acknowledge this trade-off while emphasizing the equity benefits.

When discussing the "one person does all the work" problem:
- This often happens because the task could be done by one person
- Design tasks that genuinely require multiple contributions
- Jigsaw is an excellent example of this
