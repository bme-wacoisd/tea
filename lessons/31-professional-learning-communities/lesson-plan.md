## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Ask: "Would you rather figure out how to teach alone, or learn alongside colleagues?"
- Collect responses—note concerns about comparison or judgment
- Introduce: PLCs as structured collaboration that accelerates improvement

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Compare staff meetings vs. PLCs
- Present the four guiding questions
- Describe key PLC practices (looking at student work, common assessments, etc.)
- Discuss why PLCs fail
- Explain the "my students" to "our students" shift

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at the four questions for emphasis

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Model PLC-style discussion: What would help new teachers most?
- Instructor circulates to guide collaborative inquiry

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share insights about opening practice to colleagues
- Discuss the autonomy vs. collective responsibility tension
- Address fears about judgment in collaborative settings

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Teachers who collaborate improve faster—and so do their students
- Preview: PLCs are where professional learning happens
- Challenge: Think about what kind of colleague you want to be

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of collaborative discussion; understanding of four questions
- **Summative**: Quiz on PLC questions, practices, and failure modes

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide four questions as a reference card
- **For advanced students**: Research lesson study (Japanese PLC model)
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (collaborative, inquiry, collective, intervention)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson should model collaborative practices. Consider using a discussion protocol for the group work—give a specific structure rather than open-ended conversation.

The "opening your practice" discussion (Prompt 3) may surface real fears. Acknowledge that being observed feels vulnerable. Emphasize that PLC observations are not evaluative—they're about learning together.

On autonomy vs. collective responsibility: Frame these as complementary, not competing. You can have professional judgment about how to teach while also taking shared ownership of all students' success.

Richard DuFour's key insight: "The most promising strategy for sustained school improvement is developing the ability of school personnel to function as professional learning communities."
