# Group Discussion: Learning Together

## Prompt 1: Meeting vs. Collaborating
What's the difference between teachers "meeting" and teachers "collaborating"? Think of examples of each. What makes collaboration more than just being in the same room?

## Prompt 2: The Skipped Question
Of the four PLC questions (What should students learn? How will we know? What if they haven't? What if they have?), which do you think teachers most often skip? Why might that question get neglected?

## Prompt 3: Opening Your Practice
What would it take for you to be comfortable having a colleague observe your teaching—not to evaluate you, but to learn together? What fears might get in the way? How could those be addressed?

## Prompt 4: New Teacher Advantage
How might PLCs help new teachers improve faster than they would learning alone? What specific PLC practices would be most valuable in your first year?

## Prompt 5: Team Norms
Imagine you're joining a team of teachers for weekly PLC meetings. What norms would you want established to make the time productive? What behaviors would undermine collaboration?

## Prompt 6: Autonomy and Collective Responsibility
Teachers often value autonomy—the freedom to teach their own way. How do you balance respecting teacher autonomy with taking collective responsibility for all students? Are these in tension, or can they coexist?
