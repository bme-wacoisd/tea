# Learning Together

Professional Learning Communities

## The Core Insight

Teachers who work in isolation improve slowly.

Teachers who collaborate around student learning improve rapidly—and so do their students.

Speaker notes: Richard DuFour demonstrated this over decades at Adlai Stevenson High School.

## Staff Meeting vs. PLC

| Staff Meeting | PLC |
|---------------|-----|
| Information delivery | Collaborative inquiry |
| One-way communication | Discussion and dialogue |
| Administrivia | Student learning focus |
| Sit and listen | Active problem-solving |
| What did I cover? | What did they learn? |

Speaker notes: The structure of collaboration matters as much as the fact of it.

## The Four PLC Questions

1. What do we want students to learn?
2. How will we know if they've learned it?
3. What will we do if they haven't learned it?
4. What will we do if they already know it?

Speaker notes: These questions drive all PLC work.

---

## Question 1: What Should Students Learn?

- Clarity on essential standards
- Agreement on what matters most
- Common understanding of expectations

Speaker notes: Teams must agree on the "what" before addressing the "how."

---

## Question 2: How Will We Know?

- Common assessments
- Shared criteria for success
- Looking at student work together

Speaker notes: If you can't measure it, you can't know if you taught it.

---

## Question 3: What If They Haven't?

- Interventions for struggling students
- Reteaching strategies
- Additional time and support

Speaker notes: This is the equity question—every student deserves success.

---

## Question 4: What If They Already Know?

- Extension for advanced students
- Enrichment opportunities
- Avoiding ceiling effects

Speaker notes: High-achieving students deserve challenge too.

---

## PLC Practices

- **Looking at student work** — What patterns do we see?
- **Common assessments** — How do results compare?
- **Instructional rounds** — What can we learn from each other?
- **Collaborative planning** — How should we teach this?

Speaker notes: These practices only work with trust and productive norms.

---

## Why PLCs Fail

- Contrived collegiality without genuine trust
- Meeting about nothing—no student learning focus
- Data without action—looking but not changing
- Blame-storming—explaining why students can't learn

Speaker notes: Going through the motions isn't collaboration.

## The Shift in Thinking

| Old Thinking | PLC Thinking |
|--------------|--------------|
| My students | Our students |
| I taught it | Did they learn it? |
| Close my door | Open my practice |
| Expert on my own | Learn from colleagues |

Speaker notes: Collective responsibility adds a layer, doesn't replace individual responsibility.

## Closing

The most promising strategy for school improvement is developing the ability to function as professional learning communities.

Speaker notes: You'll be a better teacher with colleagues than alone.
