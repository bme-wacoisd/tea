# Keeping Records That Protect You and Your Students

Documentation for Teachers

---

## Why Documentation Matters

A parent claims their child never received help.
An administrator questions a grade.
A colleague disputes your collaboration.

Without records, it's your word against theirs.

Speaker notes: Documentation is protection, not bureaucracy.

## Types of Records Teachers Keep

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Academic | Grades, assessments, work samples, interventions |
| Behavioral | Attendance, incidents, responses |
| Communication | Parent contacts, emails, conferences |
| Compliance | IEP implementation, 504 accommodations |

Speaker notes: Different records serve different purposes. All need organization.

## Best Practice: Be Timely

Record information the same day.
- Details fade quickly
- Late documentation raises questions
- "I think it was last Tuesday..." isn't credible

Speaker notes: If you wait, you'll forget crucial details or never get around to it.

---

## Best Practice: Be Factual

Write what happened, not interpretations.

**YES**: "Marcus threw his pencil across the room."
**NO**: "Marcus had an attitude and acted out."

**YES**: "Student said 'This is stupid' and left the room."
**NO**: "Student was disrespectful."

Speaker notes: Facts are defensible. Interpretations invite argument.

---

## Best Practice: Be Specific

Include dates, times, and details.

**YES**: "On 10/15 at 2:30pm, contacted parent by phone. Left voicemail requesting callback."

**NO**: "Tried to contact parent."

Speaker notes: Specific details show you were thorough and professional.

---

## Best Practice: Be Professional

Assume anything you write could be read by:
- Parents
- Administrators
- Lawyers

No sarcasm. No venting. No judgmental language.
Stick to facts.

Speaker notes: Write as if it's going to be projected on a screen in a courtroom. It might be.

## What is FERPA?

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act

Protects student records from unauthorized disclosure:
- Grades are private
- Special education status is private
- Disciplinary records are private

Speaker notes: Federal law. Violations can have serious consequences.

---

## Confidentiality in Practice

"How's that Smith kid doing in your class?"

Even well-meaning hallway conversations can violate FERPA.

Ask: Does this person have a legitimate educational need to know?

Speaker notes: Don't share student information with people who don't need it for educational purposes.

---

## When Documentation Matters Most

Document carefully when you see:
- Patterns of behavior (good or concerning)
- Academic struggles needing intervention
- Parent concerns or complaints
- Safety issues
- Changes that might indicate problems

If you think "I should probably write this down," you should.

Speaker notes: Trust your instincts. If something seems notable, document it.

## Closing

If you think "I should probably write this down," you should.

Documentation protects students, you, and your school.

Speaker notes: Good records are your best defense and your students' best advocacy tool.
