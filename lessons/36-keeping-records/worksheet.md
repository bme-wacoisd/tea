# Group Discussion: Keeping Records

## Prompt 1: Same-Day Documentation
Why is it important to document events the same day rather than waiting? What happens to your memory over time, and how does that affect the credibility of your records?

## Prompt 2: Facts vs. Interpretations
What's the difference between documenting facts and documenting interpretations? Rewrite this sentence to be factual: "Sarah was being disrespectful and had a bad attitude during class."

## Prompt 3: FERPA in Practice
How does FERPA affect what you can share about students? A parent volunteer asks how a particular student is doing academically. What do you say?

## Prompt 4: Defending a Grade
Imagine a parent challenges a grade you gave their child, demanding to know why their student received a C instead of a B. What documentation would you want to have to support your decision?

## Prompt 5: Balancing Act
How do you balance thorough documentation with actually teaching? You have 25 students, behaviors happening daily, and content to cover. What systems could help you document efficiently without taking over your life?

## Prompt 6: Communication Tracking
What record-keeping system might you use to track parent contacts? Design a simple system—what information would you record for each contact?
