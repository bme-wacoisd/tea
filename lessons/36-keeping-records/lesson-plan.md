## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Present scenarios: Parent challenges grade, administrator questions intervention, colleague disputes collaboration
- Ask: "Without records, what do you have?"
- Frame: Documentation is protection, not bureaucracy

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Review types of records: academic, behavioral, communication, compliance
- Present best practices:
  - Timely: Same-day documentation
  - Factual: Events, not interpretations
  - Specific: Dates, times, details
  - Professional: Assume it could be read by anyone
- Introduce FERPA and confidentiality requirements
- Show examples of good vs. poor documentation

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage while students follow along
- Pause at the FERPA section for emphasis

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key task: Convert interpretive statements to factual documentation
- Instructor circulates to guide discussions

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share rewritten documentation examples
- Discuss systems for tracking parent contacts
- Address the balance between documentation and teaching

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: If you think "I should probably write this down," you should
- Documentation protects students, you, and the school
- Challenge: Create a parent contact log template

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of fact-vs-interpretation rewrites; understanding of FERPA
- **Summative**: Quiz on documentation best practices and record types

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide documentation templates with prompts
- **For advanced students**: Research district-specific documentation requirements
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (documentation, confidentiality, compliance, FERPA)

## Instructor Notes

Students may underestimate how important documentation becomes until they need it. Use real scenarios (anonymized) where documentation saved a teacher or where lack of documentation caused problems.

The fact-vs-interpretation distinction is crucial:
- "Marcus threw his pencil" = fact
- "Marcus had an attitude" = interpretation
- "Marcus was disrespectful" = interpretation
- "Marcus said 'This is stupid'" = fact (direct quote)

FERPA violations can seem minor but have serious consequences. Even well-meaning conversations in the hallway or teacher's lounge can cross the line.

The balance question is real—teachers have limited time. Efficient systems matter. A simple spreadsheet for parent contacts, consistent grading practices, and same-day brief notes can prevent problems without overwhelming the teacher.
