# Keeping Records That Protect You and Your Students

A parent calls the principal claiming their child never received extra help. An administrator questions why a student failed. A colleague says you never responded to their email about a struggling student. In each case, you know what really happened—but without records, it's your word against theirs. Documentation isn't bureaucracy or busywork. It's protection for you, your students, and your school.

Teachers maintain several types of records. Academic records include grades, assessment data, work samples, and documentation of interventions. Behavioral records track attendance, incidents, and your responses to problems. Communication records document parent contacts—every phone call, email, and conference should have a record with the date, topic, and outcome. Legal compliance records show that you've implemented IEP accommodations and 504 plans. When a special education coordinator asks "How have you been accommodating Marcus's extended time?", you need more than "I've been doing it"—you need specific documentation.

The best documentation follows clear principles. Be timely—record information the same day because details fade quickly and late documentation raises questions. Be factual—write what happened, not your interpretation. "Marcus threw his pencil across the room" is documentation. "Marcus had an attitude" is opinion. Be specific—include dates, times, and details. "On 10/15 at 2:30pm, contacted parent by phone. Left voicemail requesting callback" tells the whole story. Be professional—assume anything you write could be read by parents, administrators, or lawyers someday, because it might be.

FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) is the federal law protecting student educational records. Grades are private. Special education status is private. Disciplinary records are private. You cannot share student information with unauthorized people—even well-meaning hallway conversations can violate confidentiality. "How's that Smith kid doing in your class?" seems innocent, but sharing academic or behavioral information with someone who doesn't need it for educational purposes crosses a line. Good record-keeping means keeping the right records AND keeping them confidential.
