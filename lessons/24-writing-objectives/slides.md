# Writing Objectives That Mean Something

Clear, Measurable Learning Objectives

---

## The Problem

"Students will understand fractions."

How do you know when they "understand"? What does it look like?

Speaker notes: Understanding is invisible. You can't observe or measure it.

---

## The Solution: ABCD Objectives

| Component | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Audience | Who is learning? |
| Behavior | What will they DO? |
| Condition | Under what circumstances? |
| Degree | How well? |

Speaker notes: Four components create a complete, measurable objective.

---

## Example: ABCD in Action

**Audience**: Students

**Behavior**: will compare fractions using <, >, = symbols

**Condition**: Given pairs of fractions with unlike denominators

**Degree**: with at least 80% accuracy

Speaker notes: Every part answers a question. Together they create clear targets.

## The Verb Matters Most

| Vague (Avoid) | Observable (Use) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Understand | Explain, Compare |
| Know | Identify, Describe |
| Learn | Demonstrate, Apply |
| Appreciate | Analyze, Evaluate |

Speaker notes: Vague verbs describe invisible internal states.

## Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs

| Level | Verbs |
|-------|-------|
| Remember | identify, list, define, name, recall |
| Understand | explain, describe, summarize, compare |
| Apply | demonstrate, solve, use, illustrate |
| Analyze | examine, distinguish, categorize |
| Evaluate | judge, critique, justify, assess |
| Create | design, construct, compose, produce |

Speaker notes: Higher levels require more complex thinking.

---

## Weak → Strong Transformations

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Understand the Civil War" | "Identify three causes and explain their impact" |
| "Know about plants" | "Label five plant parts with 100% accuracy" |
| "Learn addition" | "Solve 10 problems correctly in 2 minutes" |

Speaker notes: Strong objectives specify exactly what success looks like.

## Objectives Drive Everything

If your objective says COMPARE...
- Your assessment must require comparison

If your objective says CREATE...
- Worksheets won't cut it

If your objective says IDENTIFY...
- A matching test works

Speaker notes: The verb determines your activities and assessments.

## For Students: "I Can" Statements

"Students will identify the three branches of government"

becomes

"I can name the three branches of government and explain what each one does."

Speaker notes: Student-friendly language helps them aim for the target.

---

## What About "Appreciate"?

"Students will appreciate poetry."

Problem: You can't observe appreciation.

Solution: What behavior shows appreciation?

"Students will select a favorite poem and explain why the author's word choices are effective."

Speaker notes: Operationalize abstract goals into observable behaviors.

---

## The Rule

Write the objective FIRST.

Then plan activities that build toward it.
Then design assessment that measures it.

The objective focuses everything else.

Speaker notes: Objective-first planning prevents misalignment.

---

## Closing

A clear objective tells you:
- What to teach
- What to assess
- When you're done

If you can't measure it, you can't teach it.

Speaker notes: Clarity helps everyone—teacher and students.
