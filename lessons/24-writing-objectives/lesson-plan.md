## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Write on board: "Students will understand fractions."
- Ask: "How do you know when a student 'understands'? What does understanding look like?"
- Collect responses—highlight the problem of invisible verbs

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce ABCD format: Audience, Behavior, Condition, Degree
- Show vague vs. specific verb comparison table
- Present Bloom's Taxonomy action verbs by level
- Walk through transformation examples (weak → strong)
- Explain how objectives drive assessment choices

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at transformation examples for emphasis

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Transform "Students will understand multiplication" into ABCD format
- Instructor circulates to check verb choices

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share their rewritten objectives
- Discuss why "enjoy" and "appreciate" are problematic
- Address how to handle different readiness levels

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: The verb determines what you teach and assess
- Reminder: Clear objectives help both teachers and students
- Challenge: Write objectives BEFORE planning activities

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality of transformed objectives in group discussion
- **Summative**: Quiz on ABCD components, verb selection, and alignment

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide Bloom's Taxonomy verb list as reference
- **For advanced students**: Practice writing objectives at multiple Bloom's levels for same content
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (observable, measurable, criterion, cognitive)

## Instructor Notes

This lesson models clear objective writing. The objectives listed above follow ABCD format intentionally—point this out to students.

Common student mistakes:
- Using "understand" or "know" as the verb
- Writing what the teacher will do, not what students will demonstrate
- Forgetting the condition or degree

When discussing "appreciate" and "enjoy" (Prompt 6), acknowledge these are valuable goals but explain they must be operationalized—what observable behavior indicates appreciation?

Emphasize: The objective isn't bureaucracy. It focuses the entire lesson. If you don't know what students should be able to DO, you can't plan activities or create assessments.
