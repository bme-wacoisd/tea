# Group Discussion: Writing Objectives That Mean Something

## Prompt 1: Transform the Vague
Take this vague objective: "Students will understand multiplication." Using the ABCD format (Audience, Behavior, Condition, Degree), rewrite it into a clear, measurable objective. What verb did you choose? Why?

## Prompt 2: Why Vague Happens
Why do teachers often write vague objectives like "Students will know about the Civil War"? What makes specific objectives harder to write? What are the costs of vagueness?

## Prompt 3: Objective → Assessment
You write an objective: "Students will compare and contrast two characters from the novel, identifying at least three similarities and three differences." What assessment would match this objective? What would NOT work?

## Prompt 4: Choosing the Right Level
When might you write an objective at the "Remember" level (identify, list, recall)? When should you aim for "Analyze" or "Create"? How do you decide what cognitive level is appropriate?

## Prompt 5: Same Lesson, Different Students
You have students at different readiness levels in the same class. How might you write objectives that challenge everyone? Can you have different objectives for different students in the same lesson?

## Prompt 6: The Feelings Problem
A teacher wants students to "enjoy reading" or "appreciate poetry." These are valuable goals, but they can't be measured. What's wrong with using these as learning objectives? How could you revise them to be measurable while still honoring the underlying goal?
