# Writing Objectives That Mean Something

A teacher writes on the board: "Students will understand fractions." This sounds like a reasonable goal. But here's the problem: How do you know when a student "understands"? What does understanding look like? What do you assess? The word "understand" is invisible—you can't see it or measure it. And if you can't measure it, you can't know if you taught it.

Good learning objectives are specific, observable, and measurable. They tell students exactly what they'll be able to DO by the end of the lesson, and they tell teachers exactly what to ASSESS. The formula for strong objectives has four components, often called ABCD: Audience (who is learning), Behavior (what they'll be able to do), Condition (under what circumstances), and Degree (how well). Compare these two versions: "Students will understand the water cycle" versus "Given a diagram, students will label the four stages of the water cycle with 100% accuracy." The first is vague and unmeasurable. The second is specific—you know exactly what success looks like.

The key is choosing the right verb. Words like "understand," "know," "appreciate," and "learn" are tempting but useless for objectives because they describe internal states you can't observe. Instead, use action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy: identify, explain, compare, analyze, evaluate, create. These words describe observable behaviors. If your objective says students will "compare" two things, your assessment must require comparison. If your objective says students will "create" something, a multiple-choice test won't work. The verb in your objective determines everything else—what you teach, what you assess, and what activities you plan.

Clear objectives also help students. When students know the target, they can aim for it. Many teachers post objectives as "I can" statements: "I can identify the three branches of government and explain their roles." This tells students exactly what they're working toward and lets them self-assess whether they've gotten there. Vague objectives leave everyone guessing. Clear objectives focus the entire lesson—for teacher and students alike.
