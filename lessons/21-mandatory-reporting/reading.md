# When You Must Speak Up

In Texas, teachers are "mandatory reporters." This legal term means that if you suspect a child is being abused or neglected, you are required by law to report it within 48 hours. Not "when you're certain." Not "after you've gathered evidence." Not "tell the principal and let them decide." YOU must report, directly, within 48 hours of forming a reasonable suspicion. Failing to report is a criminal offense that can result in losing your teaching certificate and even jail time. The law exists because children depend on trusted adults to protect them, and teachers are uniquely positioned to notice when something is wrong. You see children every day. You notice when their behavior changes. You may be the adult they trust enough to confide in. Your report could save a life.

There are four types of maltreatment you should understand. Physical abuse includes unexplained injuries like bruises, burns, or broken bones—especially injuries in various stages of healing, or injuries that don't match the explanation given. Emotional abuse involves constant criticism, rejection, or threats that harm a child's emotional development. Sexual abuse may show through age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, fear of specific places or people, or regression to younger behaviors. Neglect is the failure to provide basic needs: persistent hunger, inappropriate clothing for weather, chronic poor hygiene, untreated medical or dental problems, or being left unsupervised. Beyond physical signs, watch for behavioral changes: a child who suddenly doesn't want to go home, who fears certain adults, who becomes unusually watchful or compliant, or who regresses to behaviors like bed-wetting or thumb-sucking they had outgrown.

When you suspect abuse, your job is to report—not to investigate. Call the Texas Abuse Hotline at 1-800-252-5400 or report online at txabusehotline.org. Provide the child's name, age, and address if you know them, explain what you observed, and answer the operator's questions. Don't confront the suspected abuser. Don't tell parents you're making a report. Don't interrogate the child—that's the job of trained investigators. If a child discloses abuse to you directly, stay calm. Don't show shock or disbelief. Listen without probing for details. Believe them—children rarely lie about abuse. Reassure them: "This is not your fault. You did the right thing telling me." Then report what the child told you.

Common hesitations prevent reports and allow harm to continue. "But the parent seemed nice"—abusers don't look like monsters; they're often charming and likeable. "I don't want to ruin the family"—the goal of reporting isn't to punish but to get help; many families receive services and improve. "I'm not completely sure"—you don't need proof or certainty; reasonable suspicion based on what you observed is enough. "Someone else must have reported already"—never assume this; you have a legal obligation regardless of what others might have done. The law protects reporters who act in good faith. You cannot be sued for reporting. You ARE protected when you speak up. You are NOT protected if you fail to report.

Remember the key facts: 48 hours from the moment you form a suspicion. The Texas Abuse Hotline is 1-800-252-5400. You must report yourself, not just inform administration. Document your observations factually—what you saw, what the child said, when it happened. Your job is to notice and report, not to investigate or prove. Child Protective Services and law enforcement have trained investigators for that work. Do your part. Let them do theirs. A child may be counting on you being the one adult who notices, the one adult who acts, the one adult who speaks up when they cannot speak for themselves.
