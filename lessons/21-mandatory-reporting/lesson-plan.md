## Instructor Notes

This topic is serious and can be emotionally heavy. Approach it factually and professionally—the goal is preparation, not fear.

Some students may have personal experiences with abuse in their own histories. Be prepared to:
- Offer to talk privately after class
- Provide counseling referral information
- Not require students to share personal experiences

Emphasize the protective aspects: teachers who report are protected by law; teachers who fail to report are not. The law exists to help children, not to punish families.

Keep the hotline number visible throughout the lesson: 1-800-252-5400
