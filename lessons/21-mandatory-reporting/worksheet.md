# Group Discussion: When You Must Speak Up

## Prompt 1: Why Individual Teachers?
Why do you think the law puts reporting responsibility on individual teachers, not just schools or administrators? What would happen if teachers could just tell the principal and let them handle it?

## Prompt 2: The Repeated Explanation
A child has a black eye. The parent says they fell off a bike. This is the third time this semester you've heard an explanation like this. What do you do? What factors would you consider? What if you're wrong?

## Prompt 3: The Hesitation
What might make a teacher hesitate to report suspected abuse? (Fear of being wrong, relationship with the family, not wanting to get involved, etc.) How would you overcome that hesitation? What are the costs of NOT reporting?

## Prompt 4: The Secret
A child confides in you about something happening at home and begs you not to tell anyone. They trusted you with this information. How do you respond to them? What do you say? How do you handle their request for secrecy?

## Prompt 5: Your Role vs. CPS's Role
What's the difference between your role (reporting suspicions) and CPS's role (investigating)? Why is it important that teachers don't try to investigate themselves? What could go wrong if you tried to gather evidence?

## Prompt 6: After the Report
A report has been made about a student in your class. CPS is investigating. How can you support this child during and after the investigation? What does the child need from you during this time?
