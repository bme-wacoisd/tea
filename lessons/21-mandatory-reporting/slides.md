# When You Must Speak Up

Mandatory Reporting

---

## The Law

If you suspect child abuse or neglect, you must report it within 48 hours.

Not "wait until you're sure." Not "tell the principal and let them decide." YOU report.

Speaker notes: Failing to report is a criminal offense.

---

## Why This Law Exists

- Children depend on trusted adults to protect them
- Teachers see children daily and notice changes
- Children may disclose to teachers they trust
- You may be the one adult who notices
- Failing to report is a criminal offense

Speaker notes: Teachers are often the first line of defense.

## Types of Maltreatment

| Type | Warning Signs |
|------|---------------|
| Physical Abuse | Unexplained injuries, injuries in various stages of healing |
| Emotional Abuse | Constant criticism, extreme behavior, developmental delays |
| Sexual Abuse | Age-inappropriate knowledge, fear of specific people |
| Neglect | Persistent hunger, poor hygiene, untreated medical needs |

Speaker notes: Watch for patterns, not just single incidents.

---

## Behavioral Warning Signs

- Sudden change in behavior or school performance
- Doesn't want to go home
- Fear of certain adults
- Overly watchful, as if preparing for something bad
- Regression to younger behaviors

Speaker notes: Changes in behavior are often the first signs.

## What To Do vs. What NOT To Do

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Listen calmly if child discloses | Confront the suspected abuser |
| Believe the child | Tell parents you're reporting |
| Report your suspicions | Interrogate the child |
| Reassure: "Not your fault" | Promise to keep secrets |

Speaker notes: Your role is to report, not investigate.

## If a Child Discloses

Stay calm. Listen. Believe.

Children rarely lie about abuse. "This is not your fault. You did the right thing telling me."

Speaker notes: Let them tell you in their own words without probing.

---

## Common Hesitations

- "But the parent seemed nice" — Abusers don't look like monsters
- "I don't want to ruin the family" — Reporting gets help, not punishment
- "I'm not sure" — You don't need proof, just reasonable suspicion
- "Someone else probably reported" — Never assume this

Speaker notes: These are the thoughts that prevent reports and allow harm to continue.

---

## Quote

"You might be the one adult a child trusts enough to reach out to. Your report could save a life."

---

## Your Protection

- Texas law provides immunity for good-faith reports
- You cannot be sued for reporting
- You ARE protected when you speak up
- You are NOT protected if you fail to report

Speaker notes: The law protects reporters, not non-reporters.

---

## Remember

- 48 hours from suspicion — not from certainty
- YOU must report — not just tell administration
- Document observations factually
- Save the hotline number: 1-800-252-5400

Speaker notes: These are the key takeaways.

## Closing

Your job is to notice and report. Not to investigate or prove.

Let the professionals do their job. Do yours.
