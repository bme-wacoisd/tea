# How Children Think

## Slide 1: Title
How Children Think
Why Kids Aren't Just Small Adults

---

## Slide 2: Revolutionary Discovery
A REVOLUTIONARY DISCOVERY
Children don't think like adults.
They think in fundamentally different ways at different ages.

---

## Slide 3: Jean Piaget
- Swiss psychologist, originally trained as biologist
- Fascinated by children's "wrong" answers on tests
- Same-age children made the same mistakes
- Discovered: cognition develops in stages

---

## Slide 4: Core Insight
"It's not that children know less. Their minds actually work differently."
— The core insight of Piaget's work

---

## Slide 5: Famous Experiment
THE FAMOUS EXPERIMENT
Pour water into a taller glass.
Young children insist there's MORE water now.
They're not confused. Their brains can't process it yet.

---

## Slide 6: Conservation
- Understanding that quantity stays the same
- Even when appearance changes
- Tall glass vs. short glass: same amount
- Young children literally cannot see this

---

## Slide 7: Four Stages Table
| Stage | Ages | What's Happening |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Sensorimotor | 0-2 years | Learning through senses and movement |
| Preoperational | 2-7 years | Language, pretend play, egocentric |
| Concrete Operational | 7-11 years | Logical thinking with concrete objects |
| Formal Operational | 11+ years | Abstract and hypothetical thinking |

---

## Slide 8: Preoperational (Ages 2-7)
- Language explodes
- Symbolic play emerges (pretend!)
- Egocentric: assumes others see what they see
- Cannot yet do logical operations
- Conservation not yet understood

---

## Slide 9: Concrete Operational (Ages 7-11)
- Logical thinking with concrete objects
- Conservation NOW understood
- Can classify, order, and organize
- Still struggles with pure abstraction
- Need hands-on materials to reason

---

## Slide 10: Formal Operational (11+)
- Abstract and hypothetical thinking
- "What if" reasoning
- Can think about thinking
- Scientific hypothesis testing
- Not everyone fully reaches this stage

---

## Slide 11: What This Means for Teachers
UNDERSTAND:
- Match activities to developmental stage
- Use concrete before abstract
- Mistakes often = development, not laziness
- Build on what they CAN do

DON'T ASSUME:
- "I explained it, so they should get it"
- Abstract concepts work for all ages
- Struggling means not trying
- All kids develop at the same rate

---

## Slide 12: Key Insight
Readiness matters.
Clear explanation isn't enough.
The brain must be ready to process.

---

## Slide 13: Practical Applications
- Use manipulatives before symbols
- Let students handle, touch, experience
- Don't skip concrete to get to abstract faster
- Recognize developmental limits, not laziness
- Design activities for the stage, not the grade

---

## Slide 14: Concrete → Abstract Table
| Concept | Concrete First | Then Abstract |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Addition | Counting blocks | Number sentences |
| Fractions | Pizza slices | ⅓ + ¼ |
| History | Stories of real people | Themes and patterns |
| Science | Hands-on experiments | Formulas and laws |

---

## Slide 15: Closing
Meet students where their minds are.
Development, not deficiency.
