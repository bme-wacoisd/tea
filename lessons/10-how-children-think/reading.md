# How Children Think at Different Ages

Show a five-year-old two identical glasses of water. She agrees they contain the same amount. Now, while she watches, pour one glass into a taller, thinner container. Ask again: which has more? She will point to the tall glass—even though she just watched you pour, even though nothing was added. This isn't confusion or inattention. Her brain literally cannot perform the mental operation of "conserving" quantity when appearance changes. Children don't just know less than adults; they think in fundamentally different ways.

When researchers first noticed that children of similar ages made the same "wrong" answers on tests, most dismissed it as simple mistakes. But Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget saw something deeper: children's errors revealed how their minds actually work. His decades of research identified four main stages of cognitive development. In the sensorimotor stage (birth to age 2), infants learn through senses and physical actions. In the preoperational stage (ages 2-7), children develop language and symbolic play but cannot yet think logically—this is when the water glass experiment fails. In the concrete operational stage (ages 7-11), children can think logically about concrete objects and finally understand conservation. In the formal operational stage (beginning around age 11), abstract and hypothetical thinking becomes possible.

These stages aren't rigid—children develop at different rates—but they reveal something crucial: cognitive abilities unfold in a predictable sequence. You cannot skip steps. No amount of brilliant explanation will teach abstract algebra to a child whose brain hasn't yet developed abstract thinking. This doesn't mean lowering expectations—it means understanding that readiness matters.

For teachers, this carries a clear message: "I explained it clearly!" is not enough. Understanding depends on whether the child's brain is ready to process that type of thinking. A brilliant explanation of abstract fractions won't help if the student is still in the concrete operational stage and needs to physically manipulate fraction tiles first. Meeting students where their minds actually are and building systematically from concrete to abstract—that's developmental teaching.

This also changes how we interpret student struggles. When a third grader can't grasp a concept that seems obvious to us, the explanation might not be "lazy" or "not trying." It might be developmental readiness. Children are not small adults with smaller knowledge banks—they are thinking beings whose minds work differently at different stages of growth. Teaching with this understanding means designing experiences that meet children where they are, not where we wish they were.
