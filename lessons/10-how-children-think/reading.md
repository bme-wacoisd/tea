# How Children Think at Different Ages

Jean Piaget was a Swiss psychologist who changed how we understand children's minds. Originally trained as a biologist, he became fascinated by something odd: when giving intelligence tests to children, he noticed that kids of similar ages made the same "wrong" answers. A typical adult would dismiss these as simple mistakes. Piaget saw something deeper—children weren't just lacking knowledge; they were thinking in fundamentally different ways. This insight launched decades of research that transformed education.

Piaget's most famous experiments demonstrated something called "conservation." Imagine showing a child two identical glasses of water. The child agrees they contain the same amount. Now, pour one glass into a taller, thinner container while the child watches. A young child will insist the taller glass now has more water. They watched the transfer happen. They know nothing was added. Yet they cannot mentally "conserve" the quantity when the appearance changes. This isn't confusion or inattention—their brains literally cannot perform this operation yet.

Piaget identified four main stages of cognitive development. In the sensorimotor stage (birth to age 2), infants learn through their senses and physical actions. In the preoperational stage (ages 2-7), children develop language and symbolic play but cannot yet think logically. In the concrete operational stage (ages 7-11), children can think logically about concrete objects and finally understand conservation. In the formal operational stage (beginning around age 11), abstract and hypothetical thinking becomes possible. These stages aren't rigid—children develop at different rates—but they reveal something crucial: cognitive abilities unfold in a predictable sequence.

For teachers, Piaget's work carries a clear message: "I explained it clearly!" is not enough. Understanding depends on whether the child's brain is ready to process that type of thinking. A brilliant explanation of abstract fractions won't help if the student is still in the concrete operational stage and needs to physically manipulate fraction tiles first. This doesn't mean lowering expectations—it means meeting students where their minds actually are and building systematically from concrete to abstract.

This also changes how we interpret student struggles. When a third grader can't grasp a concept that seems obvious to us, the explanation might not be "lazy" or "not trying." It might be developmental readiness. Piaget reminds us that children are not small adults with smaller knowledge banks—they are thinking beings whose minds work differently at different stages of growth. Teaching with this understanding means designing experiences that meet children where they are, not where we wish they were.
