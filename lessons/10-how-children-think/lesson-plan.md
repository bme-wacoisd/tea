## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain Piaget's key discovery that children think differently at different ages
2. Identify the four stages of cognitive development and their characteristics
3. Define conservation and explain why young children struggle with it
4. Apply developmental stage knowledge to instructional planning decisions

## Texas TEKS Alignment

| TEKS | Standard |
|------|----------|
| 4 | **The student understands the learner and the learning process** - principles of human development |
| 5 | **The student understands instructional planning and delivery** - developmentally appropriate activities |

## Materials Needed

- Slides presentation (Google Slides)
- Reading handout or projected text
- Worksheet for group discussion
- Quiz (Google Forms)
- Optional: Two glasses of different shapes and water for conservation demonstration

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Demonstration: Show two identical glasses with equal water. Pour one into a taller, thinner glass.
- Ask: "Which has more water?" (Students will say "same")
- Explain: Young children say the tall glass has more. Why?

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Introduce Piaget and his discovery
- Explain the four stages with examples
- Focus on concrete vs. abstract thinking
- Show the "Concrete → Abstract" progression table

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause to connect to the opening demonstration

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Students discuss prompts verbally
- Instructor circulates to facilitate deeper thinking

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share key insights
- Address: "What does this mean for how you'll plan lessons?"
- Connect developmental readiness to avoiding blame

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Meet students where their minds are
- Challenge: This week, notice when someone struggles—is it effort or development?

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Observation during group discussion; quality of developmental connections
- **Summative**: Quiz on key concepts (Google Forms)

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling readers**: Reading passage uses accessible language; partner reading option
- **For advanced students**: Research criticisms of Piaget (Vygotsky's social emphasis)
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (conservation, egocentric, concrete, abstract)

---

## Instructor Notes

If possible, do a live conservation demonstration with water and glasses. Seeing it makes the concept memorable.

Emphasize that Piaget helps us understand student struggles without blaming them. "Developmentally not ready" is different from "not trying."
