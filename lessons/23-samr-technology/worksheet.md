# Group Discussion: Technology as a Tool, Not a Toy

## Prompt 1: Where on SAMR?
Think of a lesson you've observed (or experienced as a student) that used technology. Which SAMR level would you place it at? What made it Enhancement (Substitution/Augmentation) rather than Transformation (Modification/Redefinition)—or vice versa?

## Prompt 2: Moving Up the Ladder
Take a traditional classroom activity: a book report, a science lab write-up, or a math worksheet. Currently it's done with pencil and paper. How could you redesign this activity using technology to move it from Substitution to Modification or Redefinition? What becomes possible that wasn't possible before?

## Prompt 3: When Is Substitution Enough?
Why isn't Redefinition always the goal? Describe a situation where Substitution-level technology use is actually the right choice. What makes it appropriate in that context?

## Prompt 4: The "Because We Should" Trap
Your principal announces: "We need to be using more technology in every lesson." What are the risks of integrating technology "because we should" rather than because it improves learning? How would you respond to this pressure?

## Prompt 5: The AI Question
A student uses ChatGPT to "help" with homework. Design two scenarios: (1) One where this is Substitution-level use that harms learning. (2) One where this is Redefinition-level use that creates powerful learning. What's the difference between them?

## Prompt 6: The Equity Question
How do you balance technology integration with the reality that students have unequal access to devices and internet at home? What happens when a Redefinition-level assignment requires technology some students don't have?
