# Technology as a Tool, Not a Toy

A teacher replaces paper worksheets with an iPad app. Students now tap answers instead of writing them. Is this "technology integration"? Here's a better question: What can students do now that they couldn't do before? If the answer is "nothing, really"—if students are doing the same task on a screen instead of paper—then this isn't transformation. It's substitution. There's nothing wrong with substitution, but don't mistake it for innovation.

Ruben Puentedura, a technology consultant who worked with Maine's statewide laptop program, developed the SAMR model to help teachers evaluate their technology use. The four levels form two tiers: Enhancement (Substitution and Augmentation) and Transformation (Modification and Redefinition). At the Substitution level, technology replaces a traditional tool with no functional change—typing instead of handwriting. At the Augmentation level, technology adds functional improvement—spell check, word count, or embedded links. These are enhancements. The task is essentially the same, just with extra features. At the Modification level, technology enables significant task redesign—students collaborating in real-time on a shared document, giving feedback while writing happens. At the Redefinition level, technology makes new tasks possible that couldn't exist before—students publishing their writing to a global audience and responding to comments from real readers. These are transformations. The learning experience itself changes.

This framework becomes especially important when evaluating artificial intelligence tools in education. The same AI can operate at every SAMR level depending on how it's used. A student who asks ChatGPT to write their essay is using AI at the Substitution level—and learning nothing, because the AI did the thinking. A student who uses AI to generate multiple perspectives on an issue, then synthesizes those perspectives into their own argument while critiquing where the AI got things wrong, is using AI at the Redefinition level—developing critical thinking, content knowledge, and AI literacy simultaneously. The question isn't whether students should use AI. The question is: who is doing the thinking, the student or the machine?

Puentedura never meant SAMR as a ladder you must always climb. It's a toolbox. Sometimes Substitution is exactly right—if your goal is note-taking, typing on a laptop works fine. Not every lesson needs Redefinition. The key is intentionality. Start with your learning objective, then ask: Does technology help achieve it? What can students do now that they couldn't before? If technology doesn't serve the learning goal, don't force it. A simple pencil-and-paper activity might produce more learning than an elaborate tech setup. The goal isn't to be high-tech. The goal is for students to learn.
