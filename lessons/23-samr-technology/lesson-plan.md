## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify and describe the four levels of the SAMR model
2. Distinguish between Enhancement (Substitution/Augmentation) and Transformation (Modification/Redefinition)
3. Evaluate technology use by asking "What can students do now that they couldn't before?"
4. Apply the SAMR framework to AI tools in education

## Materials Needed

- Slides presentation (Google Slides)
- Reading handout or projected text
- Worksheet for group discussion
- Quiz (Google Forms)

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Present scenario: "A teacher replaces paper worksheets with an iPad app. Is this 'technology integration'?"
- Collect initial responses
- Introduce the SAMR model as a framework for evaluation

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Explain the four SAMR levels with clear examples
- Clarify Enhancement (S, A) vs. Transformation (M, R)
- Show how the same tool can operate at different levels depending on use
- Apply SAMR to AI tools (ChatGPT at each level)
- Emphasize: start with learning objectives, not technology

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause at the AI examples for discussion

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key discussion: Designing AI use at Substitution vs. Redefinition levels
- Instructor circulates to ensure accurate understanding

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Share examples from "Moving Up the Ladder" discussion
- Discuss equity implications of technology requirements
- Address the "because we should" pressure

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: The goal is learning, not being high-tech
- SAMR is a toolbox, not a ladder to climb
- The essential question: "What can students do now that they couldn't before?"

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Accuracy of SAMR level identification during discussions
- **Summative**: Quiz on SAMR levels, examples, and the learning-first principle

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide SAMR level quick-reference card with examples
- **For advanced students**: Research TPACK framework as a complementary model
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (substitution, augmentation, modification, redefinition, transformation)

## Instructor Notes

Model intentional technology use in this lesson. Use slides and discussion—don't add elaborate technology just because the lesson is about technology.

When discussing AI:
- Students may have strong opinions about ChatGPT in schools
- Frame the conversation around SAMR levels, not "good vs. bad"
- Emphasize: the question is who's doing the thinking

The equity discussion (Prompt 6) is important but may be sensitive. Some students may have experienced technology gaps themselves. Handle with care.

Puentedura's key insight: Maine gave laptops to every student, but achievement didn't automatically improve. The framework asks what separates classrooms where technology helps from classrooms where it's "an expensive typewriter."
