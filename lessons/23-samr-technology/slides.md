# Technology as a Tool, Not a Toy

The SAMR Model for Technology Integration

---

## The Question

A teacher replaces worksheets with an iPad app. Students tap instead of write.

Is this "technology integration"?

Speaker notes: This opens the key question: what makes technology use meaningful?

---

## A Better Question

What can students do now that they couldn't do before?

If the answer is "nothing, really"—that's substitution, not transformation.

Speaker notes: Puentedura developed SAMR to answer this question.

## The SAMR Model

| Level | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Substitution | Enhancement | Technology replaces tool, no change |
| Augmentation | Enhancement | Technology adds functional improvement |
| Modification | Transformation | Technology enables task redesign |
| Redefinition | Transformation | Technology enables new tasks |

Speaker notes: Two tiers: Enhancement (same task, better tools) and Transformation (different task).

---

## Substitution

Technology acts as a direct substitute, no functional change.

**Example**: Students type an essay instead of handwriting it.

Same task. Same outcome. Same learning.

Speaker notes: Nothing wrong with substitution—just don't confuse it with innovation.

---

## Augmentation

Technology adds functional improvement.

**Example**: Students type in Google Docs with spell check, thesaurus, word count.

Same basic task—but technology adds features paper doesn't have.

Speaker notes: Still Enhancement tier—the task is essentially unchanged.

---

## Modification

Technology enables significant task redesign.

**Example**: Students collaborate in real-time, giving feedback while drafting.

The task itself changes—this wasn't possible before technology.

Speaker notes: This is the Transformation tier—what students DO is different.

---

## Redefinition

Technology enables new tasks previously inconceivable.

**Example**: Students publish a blog to a global audience and respond to real reader comments.

This learning experience couldn't exist without technology.

Speaker notes: The highest level—but not always the goal.

---

## AI at Every SAMR Level

| Level | How AI Is Used | What Student Learns |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Substitution | AI writes the essay | Nothing—AI learned, not student |
| Augmentation | AI suggests grammar fixes | Writing mechanics |
| Modification | Student drafts, AI gives feedback, student revises | Critical evaluation |
| Redefinition | Student critiques AI's historical accuracy | Deep content + AI literacy |

Speaker notes: Same tool, different levels—depends on HOW it's used.

---

## The AI Question

Who is doing the thinking—the student or the machine?

AI at Substitution = the machine thinks
AI at Transformation = the student thinks using AI as a tool

Speaker notes: This is the essential test for AI in education.

---

## Not a Ladder—A Toolbox

Puentedura never meant "always climb higher."

Sometimes Substitution is the right tool. Not every lesson needs Redefinition.

Speaker notes: Match sophistication of tool to demands of task.

---

## The Right Questions

- What's the learning objective? (Start here)
- Does technology help achieve it?
- What can students do now that they couldn't before?
- Who is doing the thinking?

NOT: "How can I make this more high-tech?"

Speaker notes: Learning objective comes first, technology comes second.

---

## Closing

Technology should serve learning—not the other way around.

The goal isn't to be high-tech. The goal is for students to learn.

Speaker notes: The simplest tool that achieves the learning goal is the right tool.
