# Group Discussion: Preventing Problems Before They Start

## Prompt 1: A Well-Run Classroom
Think of a classroom you've been in that ran smoothly—where transitions were quick, students knew what to do, and the teacher rarely had to stop instruction for disruptions. What procedures and routines were in place? What did the teacher do (or have students do) that made it work?

## Prompt 2: Teaching Procedures Like Content
Harry Wong says "you can teach anything"—including procedures. How is teaching a procedure (like how to enter the classroom) similar to teaching academic content (like how to solve an equation)? What steps would you use for both?

## Prompt 3: The Cost of Skipping Procedures
What happens when a teacher doesn't teach procedures in the first weeks of school? What's the cost throughout the year? Why might a new teacher be tempted to skip procedures and jump straight into content?

## Prompt 4: Write a Procedure
Choose one classroom procedure (entering the room, getting materials, transitioning to group work, what to do when finished early). Write out the exact steps a student should follow. Be specific—what might you forget to include that could cause confusion?

## Prompt 5: Procedures vs. Content Time
Some teachers worry that spending two weeks on procedures means losing two weeks of content. How would you respond to this concern? What's the trade-off if you skip procedures to "save time"?

## Prompt 6: When Procedures Break Down
Even well-established procedures sometimes break down mid-year (after a break, with a new student, when students get comfortable). What should a teacher do when a routine stops working? How do you "reteach" without treating students like they're in trouble?
