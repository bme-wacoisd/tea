# Preventing Problems Before They Start

Proactive Classroom Management

---

## The Myth

Classroom management is not about discipline.

It's about organization and teaching students exactly how things work.

Speaker notes: This reframe is essential—management is teaching, not punishing.

## Quote

"The number one problem in the classroom is not discipline; it is the lack of procedures and routines."

— Harry Wong

## Harry & Rosemary Wong

- Authors of "The First Days of School"
- One of the most influential classroom management books
- Key insight: Teach procedures like academic content
- The problem isn't "bad kids"—it's unclear expectations

Speaker notes: Their book has trained millions of teachers worldwide.

## Two Kinds of Teachers

| Reactive | Proactive |
|----------|-----------|
| Wait for misbehavior | Teach expectations explicitly |
| Respond with consequences | Practice until automatic |
| Interrupt instruction constantly | Address problems before they occur |
| Always "putting out fires" | Instruction flows smoothly |

Speaker notes: Which teacher do you want to be?

---

## Key Distinction

**Procedure**: a method for doing something.
**Routine**: a procedure that's become automatic.

Your job: turn procedures into routines.

Speaker notes: Procedures require conscious thought; routines are automatic.

---

## The First Days Matter

- Effective teachers: 2-3 weeks teaching procedures
- Ineffective teachers: jump straight into content
- Procedures taught well = smooth year
- Procedures skipped = year of fighting fires

Speaker notes: The investment in the first weeks pays off all year.

## Essential Procedures Every Teacher Needs

| Category | Questions to Answer |
|----------|---------------------|
| Entering/Exiting | What do students do when they arrive? How do they line up? |
| Materials | How do they get supplies? Where do they turn in work? |
| During Instruction | How do they ask questions? What about bathroom? |
| Transitions | How do they move between activities? What if done early? |

Speaker notes: Every unclear procedure is a potential disruption.

## Teaching a Procedure

1. **EXPLAIN** the procedure — Tell them what to do
2. **MODEL** the procedure — Show them what it looks like
3. **PRACTICE** the procedure — Students do it
4. **REINFORCE** the procedure — Acknowledge when done right
5. **RETEACH** when necessary — Return when it breaks down

Speaker notes: This is the same cycle we use for academic content.

---

## The Case Study

A teacher doesn't teach procedures. Students enter noisily. Transitions take 10 minutes.

The teacher is exhausted by October. The problem isn't "bad kids."

Speaker notes: No one taught them what to do.

## Quote

"You can teach anything. But you must teach a procedure before you can expect students to follow it."

— Harry Wong

---

## Practical Steps

- Plan procedures BEFORE the first day
- Teach procedures like academic content
- Practice until routines are automatic
- Reinforce correct procedures positively
- Reteach when procedures break down

Speaker notes: Start the first day with procedures, not content.

---

## Closing

Students can't follow procedures they were never taught.

Teach, model, practice, reinforce.
