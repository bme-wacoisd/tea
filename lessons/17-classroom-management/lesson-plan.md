## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the difference between proactive and reactive classroom management
2. Define "procedure" and "routine" and explain the relationship between them
3. Describe the steps for teaching a procedure (explain, model, practice, reinforce)
4. Identify essential procedure categories that every classroom needs

## Lesson Sequence

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Describe scenario: "A teacher's class enters chaotically. Transitions take 10 minutes. Students interrupt constantly. The teacher is exhausted by October."
- Ask: What went wrong?
- Introduce Wong's insight: The problem isn't "bad kids"—it's unclear procedures

### Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Define procedure vs. routine
- Present proactive vs. reactive management comparison
- Explain why first days matter (2-3 weeks on procedures)
- Present the four essential procedure categories
- Teach the cycle: explain, model, practice, reinforce, reteach

### Read-Aloud (5 minutes)
- Read the reading.md passage aloud while students follow along
- Pause to emphasize the "teach a procedure before expecting it" principle

### Group Discussion (12-15 minutes)
- Divide into small groups (3-4 students)
- Distribute worksheet with discussion prompts
- Key activity: Groups write out exact steps for one procedure
- Instructor circulates to check for specificity (what might they forget?)

### Whole Class Debrief (5 minutes)
- Groups share their procedures—identify missing steps
- Discuss the "procedures vs. content time" trade-off
- Address what to do when procedures break down

### Closing (3 minutes)
- Key message: Students can't follow procedures they were never taught
- Challenge: This week, identify three procedures in your own school that work well

## Assessment Strategy

- **Formative**: Quality and specificity of procedures written during group work
- **Summative**: Quiz on proactive management and procedure-teaching steps

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **For struggling students**: Provide a procedure template with prompts for each step
- **For advanced students**: Analyze a real classroom's procedures and suggest improvements
- **For ELL students**: Pre-teach vocabulary (procedure, routine, proactive, transition)

## Instructor Notes

Model good classroom management during this lesson:
- Have clear transitions between sections
- Use consistent attention signals
- Acknowledge when students follow directions well

The group activity where students write out procedure steps is key. Push them to be extremely specific. "Enter the room quietly" is too vague—what does "quietly" mean? Where do they go? What do they do with their backpack? The details matter.

Point out that Wong's message is hopeful: if the problem is unclear procedures (not "bad kids"), then the solution is within your control.
