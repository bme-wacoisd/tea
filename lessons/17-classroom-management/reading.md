# Preventing Problems Before They Start

Harry Wong was a veteran science teacher when he noticed something that changed how he thought about classrooms. The teachers who struggled weren't struggling because they had "bad kids." They were struggling because no one had ever taught those kids what to do. Students entered the classroom chaotically because no one had taught them how to enter. Transitions took forever because no one had taught them how to transition. Wong realized that classroom management wasn't about discipline—it wasn't about consequences and punishments. It was about organization and teaching students exactly how things work.

Wong and his wife Rosemary wrote "The First Days of School," one of the most influential classroom management books ever published. Their central insight: you can teach anything—including procedures. A procedure is a specific method for accomplishing a task: how to enter the classroom, how to turn in homework, how to get help when the teacher is busy. A routine is what happens when a procedure becomes automatic, when students do it without thinking. Your job as a teacher is to turn procedures into routines. That requires explicit teaching, just like academic content. Wong's famous line: "You must teach a procedure before you can expect students to follow it."

The research shows that the most effective teachers spend the first two to three weeks of school teaching procedures explicitly. They don't jump into content. They teach how to enter the room, where to sit, what to do when you arrive, how to get materials, how to signal a question, how to move into groups. They model what it looks like. They have students practice. They acknowledge when it's done correctly. And they reteach when procedures break down. This feels slow at first—shouldn't we be teaching content? But the investment pays off all year. Teachers who skip procedures spend the rest of the year "putting out fires," constantly interrupted, always reacting to problems that never should have happened.

Think about what goes wrong without procedures. Students enter noisily because no one taught them how to enter quietly. They interrupt constantly because no one taught them how to ask questions appropriately. Transitions between activities take ten minutes because no one taught them how to transition efficiently. The teacher is exhausted by October, convinced they have a "bad class." But the problem isn't bad kids—it's unclear expectations. Every unclear procedure is a potential disruption waiting to happen.

The practical application is direct: before the first day of school, plan your procedures. Write them out. What do students do when they enter? Where do they sit? What's the signal for attention? How do they turn in work? Then teach each procedure like you'd teach academic content: explain it, model it, have students practice it, reinforce it when done correctly, reteach it when it breaks down. Wong calls this "proactive management"—you prevent problems through design instead of constantly reacting to problems after they occur. Students can't follow procedures they were never taught. Teach them.
