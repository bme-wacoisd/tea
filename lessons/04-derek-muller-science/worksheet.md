# Group Discussion: Teaching Science Like Derek Muller

**Instructions**: Discuss these prompts verbally with your group. One person should take notes summarizing your key points.

## Prompt 1: The Misconception Inventory

Before you teach a topic, you need to know what students already believe.

**Discuss**: Pick a science concept you might teach (gravity, magnets, germs, weather, etc.). What are 2-3 common misconceptions students might bring to that topic? Where do these wrong ideas come from?

---

## Prompt 2: Why "Clear" Fails

Muller's research showed that students who watched clear, polished explanations felt confident—but actually learned less than students who watched "confusing" videos that addressed misconceptions first.

**Discuss**: Why might confidence be a false signal of learning? Have you ever felt certain you understood something, only to discover later you had it wrong? What does this mean for how we design lessons?

---

## Prompt 3: Surfacing the Collision

Muller says learning happens when students notice the collision between what they believed and what's true.

**Discuss**: How would you surface a misconception in a lesson? What specific words or activities could make students notice their wrong idea before you correct it? Give a concrete example.

---

## Prompt 4: Science as Surprise

Muller argues that science is about updating your beliefs when reality contradicts intuition. Every scientific breakthrough came from someone realizing the obvious answer was wrong.

**Discuss**: What scientific discoveries can you think of that went against "common sense"? How would teaching science as "expecting surprises" change how students approach the subject?

---

## Prompt 5: Adapting for Your Students

Think about the grade level you most want to teach.

**Discuss**: How would you surface misconceptions with younger students (who may not be able to articulate what they believe)? How would it differ with older students? What questions could you ask to reveal what students think before you teach?

---

## Prompt 6: The Teacher's Misconceptions

We all carry misconceptions—even teachers.

**Discuss**: Is it valuable for students to see that their teacher was once wrong about something? Why or why not? How might admitting your own past misconceptions change the classroom culture?
