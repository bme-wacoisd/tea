# Slides: Derek Muller — Teaching Science

## Planning Notes

This lesson teaches future educators how to teach science using Muller's research-backed approach:
- Address misconceptions BEFORE giving correct answers
- "Clear" explanations often fail because they don't surface wrong ideas
- Learning happens at the "collision" between belief and reality
- Confidence is not the same as understanding

## Slide Flow

1. **Title**: Derek Muller - Veritasium
2. **Who Is He?**: PhD, Veritasium, the surprising finding
3. **Big Idea**: Students who watched clear videos learned LESS
4. **Comparison**: Clear video vs. Confusing video (experiment results)
5. **Quote**: Students don't arrive empty-headed
6. **Big Idea**: Learning happens at the collision
7. **Comparison**: DO vs DON'T - Muller's method
8. **Bullets**: How Veritasium videos work
9. **Quote**: Science is noticing when intuitions are wrong
10. **Table**: Adapting for ages
11. **Group Discussion**: Instructions
12. **Closing Quote**: Make them feel the gap

## Color Theme

- Steel blue primary (scientific, trustworthy)
- Amber accents (attention, discovery)
- Red = always negative/don't do this

## Note

This lesson embodies Muller's method: it surfaces the misconception (that clear teaching is best) before revealing the truth.
