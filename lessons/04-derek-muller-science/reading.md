# Teaching Science Through Derek Muller

Here is something that should worry you: students who watch "clear" educational videos often learn *less* than students who watch confusing ones.

Derek Muller discovered this while earning his PhD in physics education at the University of Sydney. He made two versions of the same science video. One was polished, clear, well-organized—everything you'd expect from good teaching. The other deliberately started by showing what people got wrong. It let viewers sit with their confusion before revealing the answer. When Muller tested both groups, the results were startling. Students who watched the clear video felt confident they understood. But on the test, they performed worse. Students who watched the "confusing" video felt uncertain—but they actually learned.

Why? Because most students don't arrive empty-headed. They arrive with ideas already in place. Some of those ideas are wrong. A clear explanation that ignores their misconceptions just slides past them. They hear the right answer, nod along, and their wrong ideas stay intact underneath. But when you surface the misconception first—when you say "Many people think X, but actually..."—you force students to notice the collision between what they believed and what's true. That collision is where learning happens.

Muller now runs Veritasium, a YouTube channel with over fifteen million subscribers. Watch any video and you'll see his method in action. He starts with a question. He often interviews people on the street to reveal common wrong answers. Only then does he explain what's really happening. He doesn't just tell you the science—he makes you feel the gap between what you thought and what's real.

This is powerful because science isn't just a collection of facts. Science is a way of noticing when your intuitions are wrong and updating them. Every breakthrough in history came from someone realizing that the obvious answer was incorrect. Teaching science means teaching students to expect surprises—to seek out the places where reality contradicts common sense.
