# Group Discussion: What Makes Teaching a Profession?

## Prompt 1: Job vs. Profession
What's the difference between a professional and an employee? Between a career and a job? Where do you think teaching falls, and why?

## Prompt 2: The Missing Pillar
Of the five pillars of professionalism (subject knowledge, pedagogical expertise, ethical commitment, continuous improvement, professional community), which do you think is most often missing in teachers who struggle? Why might that pillar be particularly important?

## Prompt 3: First Impressions
How does your dress, communication, and punctuality affect how others perceive your competence—even before they see you teach? Is this fair? Does it matter if it's fair?

## Prompt 4: The "Calling" Question
Some say teaching is a "calling"—a moral purpose beyond just employment. What are the benefits of thinking about teaching this way? What are the dangers? How do you personally think about it?

## Prompt 5: Earning Trust
Other professions (doctors, lawyers) are given significant autonomy because society trusts their professional judgment. Teachers are often more micromanaged. How do teachers earn the public's trust as professionals? What undermines that trust?

## Prompt 6: Your First Year
Imagine you're in your first year of teaching. What specific actions might you take to build a professional reputation? What mistakes might undermine that reputation?
