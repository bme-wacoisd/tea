## Instructor Notes

Model professionalism throughout this lesson. Be organized, communicate clearly, and demonstrate the behaviors you're describing.

The "calling" discussion can generate strong opinions. Some students may have strong religious or moral frameworks about vocation; others may be more pragmatic. Validate both perspectives while highlighting the risks of either extreme.

On first impressions: Acknowledge that focusing on dress and punctuality can feel superficial. But perception matters in schools. Fair or not, parents and administrators form opinions quickly.

Address the knowledge question: "If you know the content, you can teach it." This is a common misconception. Pedagogical content knowledge—knowing how students learn a subject, what confuses them, how to explain concepts multiple ways—is a specialized form of expertise.
