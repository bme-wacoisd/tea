# What Makes Teaching a Profession?

The Five Pillars of Professionalism

---

## Job vs. Profession

**Job**: Show up, do tasks, go home.

**Profession**: Specialized knowledge, ethical commitments, ongoing growth.

Teaching, at its best, is a profession—not just employment.

Speaker notes: Not everyone in a classroom is practicing teaching professionally.

## The Five Pillars of Professionalism

1. Knowledge of Subject Matter
2. Pedagogical Expertise
3. Ethical Commitment
4. Continuous Improvement
5. Professional Community

Speaker notes: These distinguish professional teachers from those just employed.

---

## Pillar 1: Subject Knowledge

- Actually KNOW what you're teaching
- Deep understanding, not just one chapter ahead
- Ability to explain concepts multiple ways
- Awareness of common misconceptions

Speaker notes: You can't teach what you don't understand.

---

## Pillar 2: Pedagogical Expertise

Knowing your subject is necessary but not sufficient.

- You must know how to TEACH it
- Understanding how learning works
- A toolkit of strategies for different learners

Speaker notes: Knowing calculus doesn't mean you can teach fractions.

---

## Pillar 3: Ethical Commitment

- Putting students' needs first
- Maintaining appropriate boundaries
- Fair treatment of all students
- Following the Code of Ethics

Speaker notes: Ethics guide decision-making when rules don't cover the situation.

---

## Pillar 4: Continuous Improvement

Professionals keep learning.

- Staying current with research
- Reflecting on practice
- Seeking feedback
- Growing throughout career

Speaker notes: The day you stop learning is the day you should stop teaching.

---

## Pillar 5: Professional Community

- Teachers don't work in isolation
- Collaboration with colleagues
- Participation in professional organizations
- Contributing to the profession

Speaker notes: Connection to larger professional conversations matters.

## Professional vs. Unprofessional Conduct

| Professional | Unprofessional |
|--------------|----------------|
| Arrives prepared | Wings it |
| Keeps learning | Stopped growing |
| Maintains boundaries | Crosses lines |
| Takes responsibility | Blames students/parents |
| Respects confidentiality | Shares student info |

Speaker notes: Daily choices build or damage reputation.

---

## First Impressions Matter

People judge your professionalism before they see your teaching:
- Dress appropriate for context
- Clear, error-free communication
- Consistent punctuality
- Organized materials
- Calm under pressure

Speaker notes: Fair or not, first impressions shape perceptions.

---

## The "Calling" Question

Some say teaching is a "calling"—a moral purpose beyond employment.

**Benefits**: Deep commitment, meaning beyond paycheck

**Dangers**: Can justify underpaying teachers, expecting unrealistic sacrifices

**The balance**: Teaching can be meaningful AND a career deserving respect and boundaries.

Speaker notes: Love the work while expecting professional treatment.

## Closing

Professionalism is demonstrated through daily actions—not claimed, but shown.

Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy.

What kind of professional do you want to become?

Speaker notes: The choice is made in small moments every day.
