Name:
Date:

Bellringer

Consider the following scenarios in a 5th grade classroom.

Ms. K stands upright at the front of the classroom. Speaking in a calm, low voice, she says, “Pass in your papers.”

Ms. J sits at her desk in the corner of the room. Uses a high-pitched fast voice, she yells, “Pass in your papers!”

How would you expect the students to react to each teacher? Based only on this scenario, what conclusions do you make about the culture in each classroom?

Answers may vary







Intro to Strong Voice
Record the definition for each term below.


Practice 1: Analyze Strong Voice in Action
As you watch, “Establish Formal Register: Hilary Lewis”, consider:  What aspects of Hilary's delivery enhance the clarity of her directions?

Practice 2: Analyze Strong Voice in Action
As you watch the videos, note how each teacher communicates the importance of her message through both her speech (i.e., quiet, slow, even, and low) and her body language.



| Vocabulary | Definition |

| Strong Voice | a technique for adjusting your speech and body language to ensure students listen carefully to what you say. |
| Communication Register | how you deliver a given message – your body language, your facial expression, and certain qualities of your speech – contributes to how that message will be received by your audience. |


| Register | Speech | Body Language & Facial Expression | Appropriate as a Classroom Teacher for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Casual | Volume varies; cadence varies; pitch varies; pace may be faster | Asymmetrical or relaxed body posture; inconsistent eye contact; sweeping hand gestures | Much of your instruction, assuming you are comfortable with a casual style |
| Formal | Quieter volume; consistent cadence with less variation in tone; clear articulation of syllables, and distinction between words; lower pitch; slower pace | Symmetrical posture; straight back; steady eye contact; chin up; hands mostly still (e.g., clasped) | Giving directions; getting students' attention, especially in large groups or situations where follow-through is less assured; much of your instruction, assuming you are comfortable with a formal style |
| Urgent | Higher volume; consistent cadence with words likely running together; higher pitch; fast pace | Wide eyes; leaning in; sharp gestures | Emergencies |


| Teacher | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Ijeoma Duru | She uses still, symmetrical posture, slows the pace of her speech, drops the pitch of her voice lower, and clearly articulates her words. This communicates to her students that every single word she says is important. |
| Emily Bisso | She rolls her should back a few times, uses a very neutral facial expression when communicating with her students. She raises her eyebrows, hold a formal pose, and then put her hands in the same learning position that her students are expected to use in class. She acknowledges follow through with a warm smile, a head nod and then continues teaching in a warm instructional tone. |
