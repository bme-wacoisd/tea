| Rationale/ Summary | If a student isn’t attending to the content, they cannot cognitively engage, but learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention. There isn’t one means of engagement that will work for every learner in every context. In this lesson, students will review strategies for multiple means of engagement and analyze a lesson plan to evaluate its use of multiple means of engagement. | If a student isn’t attending to the content, they cannot cognitively engage, but learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will examine a nonexample lesson plan to evaluate its use of multiple modes of engagement. Students will make suggestions for ways the teacher might include multiple means of engagement through recruiting interest, sustaining effort and persistence, and self-regulation. See Exit Ticket – Answer Key for exemplar response. | Students will examine a nonexample lesson plan to evaluate its use of multiple modes of engagement.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Ms. K is having a difficult time engaging all students in her daily lessons. She uses pictures and videos during her lessons and places students in groups to work together on assignments, but students still seem to be disinterested in the instructional resources, unmotivated to complete the group work, and bored with the topics being discussed. What are three strategies she could use to address these problems? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | T: Stand up, hands-up, pair up! Find a partner and compare your responses.   S: (Stand up and find a partner. Compare responses.)  T: Return to your seats. What suggestions did you have for Ms. K?   S: Student responses will vary but should reference any of the following:  Recruiting Interest Allow students choice in how they might reach a learning target. Provide opportunities for students to engage in learning experiences that are relevant and valuable to their goals and individual interests. Create a supportive environment where students feel safe to learn and take risks. Sustaining Effort/Persistence Explain the important of goals and objectives. Provide flexibility with tools and resources to challenge and motivate learners. Foster collaboration and community through flexible grouping Provide feedback that guides students toward mastery. Self-Regulation Support learners in setting personal goals that are attainable and that motivate them to take ownership of their learning.  Provide models, scaffolds, and feedback to help learners develop personal coping skills and strategies. Support learners in developing an awareness of their progress toward goals and how to learn from their mistakes.    T: How do these strategies work together to build understanding for all students?  S: The learning is personalized to support the individual needs of students. The learning is relevant to the students’ interests and goals and feedback is specific, timely, and actionable to help students progress toward mastery. |  |
| 5 mins | Guided Practice – Lesson Analysis T: Now, you are going to put together everything you’ve learned about multiple means of engagement by observing a lesson in a middle school PE class to identify evidence of the three guidelines for multiple means of engagement and determine how those guidelines come together to build student understanding.   T: Let’s look at an example clip from the lesson to find evidence of multiple means of engagement.  T: (Show MS PE Lesson from 5:43-6:43).  T: What evidence did you see of multiple means of engagement?  S: The teacher created a supportive environment where students feel safe to learn and take risks by ensuring students that even adults often do not master some of these skills. She also supported learners in developing an awareness of their progress toward goals through the reflective poster.  T: Why is it important to have students reflect on their own learning?  S: It motivates learners to take ownership of their learning and supports learners in developing an awareness of their progress toward goals and how to learn from their mistakes. | MS PE Lesson |
| 20 mins | Lesson Analysis  T: Now, you are going to work in groups of three to analyze another part of this same lesson.   T: Within your group of 3, each person will choose which means of engagement you want to look for during the lesson – recruiting interest, sustaining effort/persistence or self-regulation. Each group member will look for evidence of just that means of engagement as you watch the video lesson.  T: After your group watches the video lesson focusing on just your chosen means of engagement, you will all come back together as a group to share your evidence.    T: Finally, we will share with the whole group about what we saw to check for understanding.  T: First we will establish our groups.  T: (Direct students to create groups of 3 with students sitting close to them.)  T: Within your groups, choose which means of engagement you each want to look for in the video.  S: (Students decide on their means of engagement within their group.)  T: Now watch the video lesson, look for evidence of your selected means of engagement and record evidence in your student guide.  S: (Students watch the video lesson for evidence of their chosen means of engagement – this will likely take 10 minutes.)  T: Now use the graphic organizer to prepare to share the evidence of your chosen means of engagement with your small group.   S: (Students review their evidence and share with their small group.)  T: (Circulate to groups to support their preparation.)  T: Now that each of you have prepared, you are going to share the evidence you found of your selected means of engagement with your group.  T:  Starting with recruiting interest, you will share the evidence you found in the video lesson.  Group members should listen and take notes on each means of engagement in your student guide.  T: Each presenter will have 2 minutes to share the evidence they found.  T: (Display a two-minute timer for each means of engagement).  S: (Students share their evidence and learners listen and take notes.)  T: Now, as a group, determine how those guidelines come together to build student engagement and understanding. Record your explanation in the student guide. | MS PE Lesson |
|  | Debrief  T: Let’s collectively review what we learned.   T: (Going guideline by guideline, have students explain evidence they found for each means of engagement, correcting, and reinforcing the big ideas.)   T: How did the use of multiple means of engagement help support students in building understanding of the skill?  S: The teacher created a supportive environment where students felt safe to learn and take risks. Students were motivated to take ownership of their learning. The teacher provided models, scaffolds, and feedback to help guide students toward mastery. The teacher supported learners in developing an awareness of their progress toward goals and how to learn from their mistakes.    T: Why is it important to provide multiple means of engagement?  S: Learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention. There isn’t one means of engagement that will work for every learner in every context. A teacher has to use multiple means of engagement to in order to meet the needs of all learners. |  |
