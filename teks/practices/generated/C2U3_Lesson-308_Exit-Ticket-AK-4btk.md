Date:

- Why is it important to develop relationships with colleagues throughout the school community?
There are lots of people in the school community who have information about students. This information can be leveraged to support students academically.

- Who are some of the colleagues that can help you to support your students instructionally?

- Coaches, counselors, librarians, club sponsors, social workers, etc.

- Given the following scenario, who might the teacher go to for help? What questions might the teacher ask?
Sofia is a new student in Ms. K’s 4th grade class. Sofia’s has quickly made friends and adapted to her new school. Ms. K is surprised when she doesn’t do well on her first test because, based on what Ms. K saw in class, Sofia was understanding the material. Since Sofia is new, there are no previous teachers Ms. K can speak to that might be able to help her. What should Ms. K do next, and what questions might Ms. K ask?
Ms. K may want to discuss her concerns with the guidance counselor, since they might have insight into information that the teacher does not yet know. Additionally, the guidance counselor may be able to partner with the teacher to find out more information and develop a plan to help Sofia.
- Why might Sofia be having a hard time on tests when she does well in class?
- Is there anything going on in Sofia’s life that I can and should know about?
- What supports might she need that I am not already providing?
- Are there other ways I can assess Sofia that might work better for her given her language barriers?
