Date:
Read the following scenario and determine how Mr. K could more effectively engage in one-on-one conferences with students by using the guidelines for executive functions.

Mr. K. is using student conferences before a math test. While students engage in practice activities related to the content that will be on the test, Mr. K. calls each student to the front of the room for individual conferences. He begins the conference by sharing the student’s quiz grades from the four quizzes given throughout the unit. He asks the student to point out their lowest quiz grade and then reviews the topics assessed by the quiz. He asks the student two write down the list of topics and then asks them what they will need to study before the test.






| Guidelines | Suggestions for how Mr. Kahn can incorporate the guidelines in his one-on-one conferences |
| --- | --- |
| Support learners in setting challenging and authentic goals | Mr. K. could share the students work instead of their grades from the four quizzes. He could provide a checklist to help guide students through the work/quizzes to determine the strengths and weaknesses. |
| Support learners in developing reasonable plans for reaching their goals | He could guide students through a planning template to help them create a plan for reaching their goal by breaking it into actionable steps. |
| Provide flexible tools and processes to support organization and memory | He could provide a graphic organizer for students to organize key concepts that are going to be on the test. |
| Support learners in analyzing their growth over time and built on it | He could provide specific and actionable feedback to help the student improve. He could ask questions to prompt self-assessment and reflection. He could use work samples that show a student’s progress over time. |
