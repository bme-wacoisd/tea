| Rationale/ Summary | In our previous lesson, we discussed the importance of objectives aligning to the standard, but alignment with the standard is not the only important component of an objective. For an objective to be high-quality it also needs to be SMART. In this lesson, students will learn about the components of a high-quality objective. Students will use the SMART acronym to identify high-quality objectives and explore examples and nonexamples of high-quality objectives. Students will examine a lesson to determine if the objectives for the lesson are SMART. | In our previous lesson, we discussed the importance of objectives aligning to the standard, but alignment with the standard is not the only important component of an objective.

| 3 mins | Bellringer: Read each standard and determine which objective best aligns to the standard. 2.9G - read and write time to the nearest one-minute increment using analog and digital clocks and distinguish between a.m. and p.m. Students will use digital and analog clocks to tell time. Students will tell time to the nearest five minutes; relate a.m. and p.m. to time of day. Students will solve word problems involving time to the nearest one-minute increment. 2.8A - create two-dimensional shapes based on given attributes, including number of sides and vertices Students will build, identify, and analyze two-dimensional shapes with specified attributes. Students will create two-dimensional shapes. Students will identify two-dimensional shapes based on their attributes. 2.3A - partition objects into equal parts and name the parts, including halves, fourths, and eighths, using words Students will partition shapes. Students will partition circles and rectangles into equal parts, and describe those parts as halves, thirds, or fourths. Students will name parts as halves, fourths or eighths using words. |  |
| 2 mins | T: (Review correct responses. Ask follow-up questions and provide feedback to ensure student understanding.) T: How did you determine which objective best aligned to the standard? S: I thought about what the standard asked students to know and do with the content. For example, in #2, the standard asked students to create two-dimensional shapes based on their attributes, but one of the answer choices just had students identifying shapes based on their attributes. T: Yes – it is important that the level of rigor in the objective matches the level of rigor required by the standard. |  |
| 15 mins | Intro to the Components of a High-Quality Objective  T: Yesterday, we talked about the importance of objectives aligning to the standard, but alignment with the standard is not the only important component of an objective.   T: For an objective to be high-quality it also needs to be SMART.   T: (Display the PPT). SMART is an acronym used when creating learning objectives.   T: Here is what SMART stands for: Specific Measurable Attainable Results-Focused Time-Focused  S: (Take notes on the student guide.)   T: Let’s look at each of these in more detail.  T: An objective that is specific is detailed and has a very clear outcome. It can answer the questions of who, what, and how.   T: What do you notice about the two objectives?   S: The example goal is very specific about how students will partition shapes and which shapes students will partition. In the nonexample, the statement is very broad and doesn’t give specific details as to how students will learn partition shapes.  T: Yes – a specific goal helps students know what they are expected to know and do for that lesson and helps them know what they will be assessed on.   T: An objective that is measurable can easily be assessed or tracked to determine if the expectation has been met.   T: Can you measure the example objective?  S: Yes – students can measure progress through practice activities and exit tickets  T: An objective that is attainable is a reasonable one, particularly for the grade-level of the student. It is challenging but can be achieved.   T: What makes the example more reasonable for a single lesson than the non-example?   S: The example objective is very specific about what shapes students will be working with and how they will partition the shapes. This helps students know exactly what they will be assessed on in a single lesson which makes the goal more attainable. Opposed to the nonexample which is very broad and may not be achieved in a single lesson.   T: An objective that is results-focused is aligned with the standard or expectations for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level.   T: Let’s look at the standard for our example objective.   T: How does the example objective align with that standard?  S: The objective asks students to partition shapes, specifically circles and rectangles, into equal parts and describe those parts as halves, fourths, and eighths. What students are being asked to do in the lesson is aligned to what the standard ask students to know and do and matches the level of rigor required by the standard.  T: Based on this standard, we can see that the objective is results-focused and aligned to the standard or expectation for grade 2.   T: An objective that is time-focused sets a time frame for when the objective or goal should be achieved. Often, objectives are written to be met in a single lesson. If an objective is meant to take longer, it should be specified. Let’s look at an example:  T: You can see in this table that the time frame for the first objective listed in a single lesson, whereas the second objective will take two lessons.   T: With the example objective we discussed earlier, students should be able to partition circles and rectangles into equal parts, and describe those parts as halves, fourths, and eighths by the end of the lesson because it was not specified otherwise. |  |
| 5 mins | Examples and Nonexamples of High-Quality Objectives  T: Let’s look at an example objective from a Grade 2 ELA Unit to determine if the objective is SMART. As we work through the example, I want you to record notes in the graphic organizer in your student guide.   T: (Share via PPT as students record notes in student guide).     T: To determine if this goal is SMART, I need to consider the following: Is it specific? Is it measurable? Is it attainable? Is it results-focused? Is it time-focused?  T: Is this objective specific?  S: Yes – it tells exactly what students will do and how they will apply that skill in the lesson. They will read and spell one-syllable word with /a/ and /i/.  T: Is the objective measurable?  S: Yes - a teacher can give a check for understanding or some form of assessment to determine if students can achieve this goal.   T: Is the objective attainable based on the grade-level standard for the grade level?  S: Yes – it aligns to the grade-level standard and could be achieved in a single lesson.   T: I also want to consider if the objective is results-focused and aligned to the standard.   T: Here is the standard for this objective.  T: Does the objective align?  S: Yes – students are decoding words with the short vowels ‘a’ and ‘i’.  T: The last component of a high-quality objective is time-focused. As we discussed earlier, typically, objectives for a lesson are meant to be achieved within the lesson. Although the time frame is not listed in the objective, we can assume that the objective is meant to be achieved in this lesson since it is not specified otherwise.   T: Now, let’s look at a non-example.     T: Why is this a nonexample of a SMART objective?  S: The objective is too broad and not detailed. A teacher can give a check for understanding or some form of assessment to determine if students can achieve this goal, but the teacher isn’t going to know the types of words students need to decode. It would likely not be able to be attained in a single lesson. The objective is not detailed enough for us to know the types of words students are decoding.  T: Yes – it is important that objectives are very specific and detailed about what students should be able to know and do within a single lesson. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice: Analysis of Objectives  T: Now that we’ve learned about the components of a high-quality objective, you are going to work with a partner to examine a list of objectives to determine if they are SMART and suggest revisions to any of the objectives that did not meet the criteria for a high-quality objective.   T: (Place students in pairs and provide time to complete the activity.)  S: (Complete practice activity in the student guide.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let’s come back together to talk about what you learned.  T: How did the objectives in the lesson your examined align to the components of a high-quality objective? (Guide students in a discussion of the activity using the 6.5 Student Guide – Answer Key.)  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: Why is it important to ensure that objectives are specific, measurable, attainable, results-focused, and time-focused?  S: A teacher must ensure that a lesson is focused on the most important content and SMART objectives help do that. It is important that goals are specific so that students know exactly what they are supposed to do and what they will be assessed on.   T: What might be the impact of a lesson that does not contain high-quality objectives?  S: The lesson may not focus on the most important content, students may not know what they are learning or what they will be assessed on, the lesson may not align to the objective, etc.  T: Today, our lesson focused on identifying high-quality objectives. In future lessons, you will learn how to identify if the objectives are met within a lesson based on the instruction, tasks, and assessments. |  |
