It helps everyone understand what it means for educators to act ethically.
Teachers need to follow the law, be honest, and have good morals.



Notes: Review of Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics
Definitions

Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics
The Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics includes sections on:
Professional Ethical Conduct, Practices and Performance
Ethical Conduct Toward Professional Colleagues
Ethical Conduct Toward Students
The Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics is part of Texas law. The state’s legislature put the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics into place, and they can also vote to change it.



Practice 1: Discerning Unprofessional and Unethical Behavior
Example 1
A teacher needs to fill out some forms to complete their taxes. They print the forms on their school printer because their printer at home is out of ink.

Is this behavior unethical? Does it violate the Texas Educators’ Code of Conduct?
No.

Is it unprofessional and something that should be avoided?
Yes. Teachers should only use equipment at school for work related to their job.
Example 2
A teacher has a file cabinet in their classroom with a broken lock. They keep forgetting to notify the school facilities team about the issue, and they keep copies of their students’ IEPs in the cabinet. Is this behavior unethical? Does it violate the Texas Educators’ Code of Conduct?
No.

Is it unprofessional and something that should be avoided?
Yes. That type of confidential information should be locked up so that it cannot be accessed by others.



Practice 2: Discerning Unprofessional and Unethical Behavior through Scenarios
Below each scenario, there are two possible steps that the teacher(s) could take. For each one, circle where it is unethical, unprofessional, or acceptable and explain why.
Scenario A
Mr. A. and Ms. B are art teachers at a high school. One of their colleagues, Mr. F., is running to join the local school board. Mr. A. and Ms. B. have heard Mr. F. talk about how students don’t need art or music classes and that funding for them should be eliminated. Mr. A. and Ms. B. know how much students enjoy their classes and how important they are. They’re worried that Mr. F. will take away these opportunities if he is elected.
Mr. A. and Ms. B volunteer for the campaign of the person running against Mr. F.
Unethical		Unprofessional		Acceptable
This is acceptable because it doesn’t prevent Mr. F. from running for office, and Mr. A. and Ms. B. are allowed to vote however they’d like.

Mr. A. and Ms. B take down Mr. F.’s campaign signs.
Unethical		Unprofessional		Acceptable
This is unethical because it violates the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics. One of the standards states that “The educator shall not interfere with a colleague's exercise of political, professional, or citizenship rights and responsibilities.”
Scenario B
A parent approaches Mr. S. and asks if she can speak with him confidentially. She shares that one of the other students in the class lives in her neighborhood and that she’s worried about him. He often stops by her house hungry, and it seems like he hasn’t had a bath in a long time. He also has some bruises on his arms. She asks Mr. S. if anyone at the school has called the police to ask them to investigate.
Mr. S. looks at the school’s records and calls the parent to let her know that the school has already called, so she does not need to make a report.
Unethical		Unprofessional		Acceptable
This is unethical because Mr. S. is disclosing confidential information about a student. The other parent is not someone who is authorized to have this information.

Mr. S. says that he has not noticed any of these things about the student. He tells the parent that it’s probably not a big deal.
Unethical		Unprofessional		Acceptable
Mr. S. has not noticed anything concerning about the student’s appearance or behavior, so he doesn’t have to report anything himself. However, if the other parent is concerned, he should support that parent with sharing their concerns with the appropriate authorities.
