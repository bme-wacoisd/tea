- Mr. Jones is starting a unit on two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes with his kindergarten students. Here is the order he plans to introduce the concepts:
- Describe two-dimensional flat shapes (square, triangle, rectangle, circle)
- Describe three-dimensional flat shapes (cone, sphere, cube, cylinder)
- Describe and compare two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes in different orientations and sizes. Do you think this is the best approach to build student understanding? Why or why not?
