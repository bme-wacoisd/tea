### Lesson 3.01:  The Importance of Learning About Students

Name:
Date:

It is the beginning of the school year and Ms. M has a class full of new students in her third grade reading class. She asks her students to take a survey so she can get to know what students like and dislike, both in and out of school. She is in the process of conducting home visits to meet families and to get to know what life at home is like for her students. One of her students, Maria, shared in her student survey that she does not read very much  but enjoys being outside. When Ms. M did Maria’s home visit, she noticed that Maria did not have many books at home and the ones she had were all in Spanish. Maria’s parents, who are not fluent English speakers, shared with Ms. M that Maria is an outgoing girl who likes being with her friends.
What did Ms. M. learn about Maria:
as an individual? She enjoys being outside, she does not read often (but that does not mean she does not enjoy reading), she is friendly and outgoing.
as a learner? Maria may lack some of the resources she needs to be successful outside of school due to the language barrier. If Ms. M wants Maria to read more, she could help her find ways to access books/other materials in English.
as a member of her family? Maria’s parents are not fluent English speakers, which means Maria may have to assume the role of translator for her parents. She lives in a bilingual household which means it is likely she speaks both languages but may have a preference toward one language over the other at home or at school.
What can Ms. M. do to encourage Maria to read more? Ms. M. could help Maria to access books in English since that is what she will be exposed to in school, as well as encouraging her to find books on outdoor topics or those that have outdoor settings so that it will be more engaging for her.
