### Lesson 6.06: Sequencing the Content of a Lesson

Name:
Date:
Look at the following lesson sequence and determine if the learning is structured to build student understanding. If not, make suggestions for how the teacher could better sequence the instruction.


What do you notice about how the learning is sequenced? What could the teacher do to better sequence the instruction and build student understanding?
The teacher moves from introducing the individual values of coins to having students use different coin combinations to make a dollar. The lesson should include more instruction and practice with counting coins with the same values, such as 3 dimes make 30 cents. Students could then build on their understanding of skip counting by fives and tens to find the value of a set of coins. The teacher could then move into introducing how to count a mixed group of coins. Students need more instruction on how to use prior knowledge of skip counting and adding to determine the value of different coin combinations before moving into the guided activity and independent practice.

Respond to the following questions:
- How does intentionally sequencing the concepts and skills in a lesson support student learning?
- Intentionally sequencing the concepts and skills in a lesson support student learning by presenting the information in a logical order that helps students build on previously taught skills. A lesson that is intentionally sequenced considers that students need to be presented small amounts of information at a time and considers what information a student needs to know at different points in the lesson to best support their learning.

- How does the sequencing of a lesson relate to the Science of Learning?
- For learners to take in, process, and learn information, it must be presented in small increments and in a sequential manner.

- What might be the impact of a lesson where the learning is not sequenced?
- Students may miss out on prior knowledge and/or skills needed to fully understand the concept or skill being taught in the lesson. The lesson may be disjointed causing confusion for students.
