## Slide 7

### Plausible Anonymity

- Redirects students without using their names: Keeping redirections anonymous helps to eliminate attention-seeking behavior. Additionally, for students who are making a good-faith effort to meet expectations, redirecting anonymously both acknowledges their efforts and still upholds expectations.
- Maintains Economy of Language: Using fewer words helps students to focus on what they need to do to meet expectations and brings everyone back to the lesson as quickly as possible.
- Maintains Emotional Constancy: Again, it’s wise to use a neutral tone when delivering redirections of any kind.
