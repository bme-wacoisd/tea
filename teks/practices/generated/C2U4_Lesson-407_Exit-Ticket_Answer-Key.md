Lesson 4.07: Avoiding Overload | Too Much Information Can Interfere With Learning
Name:
Date:

Determine whether each scenario demonstrates an example of sequencing or scaffolding. Explain how the activity helps students avoid overload.



| Activity | Explanation | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mr. Hernandez presents a text excerpt to his class. While reading it aloud, he stops at words that may be unfamiliar to students to explain how he is figuring out what the word means using context clues. | Why is this an example of scaffolding?   Mr. Hernandez is scaffolding because he is providing support for his students so that they can later be successful working independently He shares how he is thinking about a text so students can understand how they should think when in a similar situation.  How does it decrease cognitive overload?  This support avoids overload by helping students better process how to tackle challenging new words in a text. |
| Ms. Brown plans out her multiplication unit starting with previously learned skills, focusing first on repeated addition and skip-counting. | Why is this an example of sequencing?   Ms. Brown is intentionally ordering her content to build on prior knowledge about addition. If students understand repeated addition, then they will have greater success in understanding multiplication.  How does it decrease cognitive overload?  Ms. Brown’s approach will help students avoid overload by helping them connect what they know about addition to the new concept of multiplication. |
