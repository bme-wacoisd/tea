### Bellringer

- You have asked two friends to review the poem that you have just written for your English class.  Below is the feedback that you received from each:
- Friend 1:  The imagery in your work is very strong.  I was able to see the environment that you described and felt like I was there, and it pulled me in as a reader.
- Friend 2: I really liked your poem.  Great job!
- After considering the feedback, which of the two do you feel is most helpful? What makes the feedback more helpful than the other?

### Quality Feedback Criteria

- Specific & clear: The feedback provides specific information about the strengths and areas where the work can be improved.  You will remember that the feedback from friend 1 in the bellringer example clearly identified the strength of the poem to be the imagery and described how the imagery impacted the reader.
- Focused on task, rather than student: A key piece of quality feedback is that is references standards versus referencing the student.  Feedback such as “I noticed you only had 3 supporting details.  The assignment asks for 5 supporting details” provides key information to the student about how they can strengthen their work.
- Identifies strengths & areas of growth: While it is important to know the areas growth and improvement, it is also important to recognize what is done well so that can be replicated in future work.
