| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will read two scenarios and respond to the following questions:   What evidence from the Five Keys of Individual Correction shows that Scenario A is a Private Individual Correction?  In Scenario B, what affect will the teacher’s actions likely have on Micah? On the class as a whole?  What might the teacher have done differently in Scenario B?

|  | Prior to beginning this lesson, ensure that you can access the following videos:  “Private Individual Correction:  Colleen Driggs” (Round 1)  “Private Individual Correction:  Colleen Driggs” (Round 2)  “Private Individual Correction:  Colleen Driggs” (Round 3)  “Private Individual Correction:  Doug Lemov” (Round 4) |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Consider the following scenario and write a script for a Private Individual Correction that adheres to the five keys for effective implementation: Maintain Privacy, Describe the Solution, Use a Warm or Neutral Tone, Bookend with Simple Tasks, and Keep it Brief.  Scenario: It’s near the end of class, and students have been engaged in independent work for some time. One student, Chelsea, has not finished, but she appears to be doodling or drawing a picture on a separate sheet of paper. Practice giving her a Private Individual Correction. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Turn and Talk: T: Turn and talk with a neighbor to share your scripted Private Individual Correction. Discuss any potential strengths and/or opportunities for improvement.  S: (Turn and talk with a neighbor.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Intro to Planning Private Individual Corrections T: You have planned your ideal interaction with a student. Now, it’s time to practice that ideal interaction.   T: When you practice delivery, you probably won't use the exact same words you've planned, and that's okay.  The act of planning with intentionality gives you the opportunity to practice the thought process you should engage in each time you deliver a Private Individual Correction.  T: Remember that in planning your Private Individual Correction, you should: Describe the solution:  Describe what you’d like your student to do in order to meet your expectations Bookend with simple tasks:  Start and end your interaction with a pair of observable directions (i.e., an "in-task" and an "out-task") Keep it brief  T: Revisit and revise your scripted Private Individual Correction with these reminders in mind.  T: Now, compare your scripted Private Individual Corrections with the example from Texas TLAC Online:  Chelsea, eyes on me please. This practice is where you show your strengths and challenges. Please use this time practically so that I can help you with your challenges, and we can celebrate your successes. Please pick up your pencil, and continue on number four.  S: (Compare scripted Private Individual Corrections with TLAC example.)  T: What did you notice?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Now, let’s double-check your scripted Private Individual Corrections. Did you describe the solution? Did you bookend your correction with simple tasks (i.e., an "in-task" and an "out-task")? Is your Private Individual Correction brief?  S: (Double-check their scripts.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 15 mins | Practice: Delivering Private Individual Correction  T: You will now practice delivering your scripted Private Individual Corrections. You will practice in rounds.  Round 1:  T: Let’s watch an example. (Show the video of TLAC Team Member Colleen Driggs modeling the practice.)  S: (Watch the video.)   T: Now, deliver your scripted Private Individual Corrections with a partner – without reading the script – while still describing the solution, bookending with simple tasks, and keeping it brief. Be sure both partners have time to practice.  S: (Deliver Private Individual Corrections with a partner.)   Round 2:  T: Now, let’s see an example of Round 2. (Show the video of TLAC Team Member Colleen Driggs modeling the practice using a warm or neutral tone.)  S: (Watch the video.)  T: (Direct students to deliver their scripted Private Individual Corrections with a partner (without reading the script) while describing the solution, bookending with simple tasks, keeping it brief, and using a warm or neutral tone.)  S: (Deliver script with a partner.)  Round 3:  T: And now an example of round 3. (Show the video of TLAC Team Member Colleen Driggs modeling the practice while taking steps to maintain privacy.)  S: (Watch the video.)  T: For this round of your practice, try: Circulating before you redirect Crouching down to the student's eye level Speaking quietly  T: Now, let’s put it all together. Deliver your scripted Private Individual Corrections one more time while describing the solution, bookending with simple tasks, keeping it brief, using a warm or neutral tone, and maintaining privacy.)  S: (Deliver script with a partner.)  Round 4: T: (Before engaging students in the final round of practice, show the video of Doug Lemov discussing feedback he often gives teachers as they first begin practicing this technique.)  S: (Watch the video.)   T: (For the final round of practice, direct students to apply everything they've already learned, along with Doug's advice.  That is, they should: Describe the solution, bookend with simple tasks, and keep it brief Use a warm or neutral tone Maintain privacy through circulating, crouching down, and speaking quietly Emphasize purpose, not power, through using body language, tone of voice, and choice of words that communicate, "I'm doing this because I care about you")  S: (Deliver script with a partner.) | Student Guide Round 1 Video: “Private Individual Correction:  Colleen Driggs”  Round 2 Video: “Private Individual Correction:  Colleen Driggs”  Round 3 Video: “Private Individual Correction:  Colleen Driggs”  Round 4 Video: “Private Individual Correction:  Doug Lemov” |
| 5 mins | Debrief:  T: (To close out the lesson: Debrief the practice by asking students to share about their experiences, including strengths and areas for improvement as aspiring teachers.)   T: Ask:  What did you change about your script or delivery throughout today’s lesson?   Why did you make those changes?      What do you think you might do differently in a classroom of your own?   What opportunities do you have for growth?   How will you incorporate least invasive intervention strategies into your teaching??   S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
