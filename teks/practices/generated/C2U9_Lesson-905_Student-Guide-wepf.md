Creating a safe environment for students to receive feedback is an important part of ensuring the feedback is received positively, especially during a student conference.  What are some things that a teacher can do to attend to a student’s emotions during a conference?


Conducting 1:1 Conferences
Steps for Conducing 1:1 Conferences with students









Model-1:1 Student Conferences

Scenario: A class of 5th grade students have recently been working on their argumentative writing.  Ms. Jeffries, their teacher, assigned the students a reading passage about school gardens.  The students were then asked to generate questions about the costs and benefits of school gardens and allowed to conduct research on the topic.  As a summative task the students were asked to write a multi-paragraph letter to convince their school principal whether or not to have a school garden. The students must clearly state their claim, support the claim with evidence from the passage or their research to develop those ideas, attend to the organization of the writing (beginning, middle and end) and utilize appropriate spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

Mrs. Jefferies has completed the grading of the task and is meeting with each student in the class in a 1:1 conference to discuss feedback.  Prior to the conference, she has asked each student to reflect on their work and identify areas of strength and areas where they need to improve based on the success criteria shared.  She also asked the students to reflect where this assignment went well and where they struggled with it.

Mrs. Jefferies is planning to meet with a student, Roberta, at the beginning of the class.  She is reviewing the writing sample submitted by Roberta and considering the feedback that she should give Roberta.  Roberta has established a clear claim that the school should have a garden but has struggled a bit with the organization of her writing and clearly supporting the claim with evidence from the passage.  After sharing the reasons why the school should have a garden, Roberta also explains the “bad things” that should be overlooked.  Roberta includes a conclusion to the letter where she invites the principal to consider the good and overlook the bad and make the right choice.


Evidence of the Steps for Conducting a 1:1 Conference

Practice: Conducting 1:1 Conferences
Scenario: The students in Mr. Blankenship’s 6th grade science classes have been examining the differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures.  As a summative assessment, Mr. Blankenship asked the students to make a 2–3-minute video presentation to teach younger students about the differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures.  In the video should show at least three examples of each classification and students should explain the basis for the classification of each example using appropriate science vocabulary.  Because the video targets younger students as the audience, it should be fun and engaging and simple enough for the younger students to understand.
Shawn, a student in Mr. Blankenship’s class, completed his assignment and submitted his video.  In his video, Shawn pretended to be a scientist investigating “mystery” substances around the house.  With his dog as a sidekick, he provided three examples of each classification.  In his description of the classification, he accidentally mixed up the definitions of compounds and mixtures but the examples he provided were correctly classified.  His video also lasted 6:30, well over the allotted time of 2-3 minutes.
Mr. Blankenship will be meeting with all his students to review his feedback of the video project.  Prior to the conference, students were asked to self-assess their projects to identify areas of strength along with ways they could improve their work.  Based on the information provided, help Mr. Blankenship prepare for his conference with Shawn using the planning document below.


Script Notes:






Round 1: Feedback on Strengths/Improvements of Conference

How did you attend to the student’s emotions and create safety?

Round 2: Feedback on Strengths/Improvements of Conference

How did you attend to the student’s emotions and create safety?

Reflection Questions:
- How did you address each of the steps of the 1:1 Conference? Were there any that you missed?

- Discuss what it felt like to play the role of the teacher vs the role of the student.  Which one was more challenging? Why?

- How did completing the planning document support the success of the conference?
