### Lesson 5.03: Best Practices for Formal and Informal Formative Assessment

Name:
Date: Text

Bellringer: Read the scenario below. As you read, look for formative assessments the teacher uses. Underline every instance of a formative assessment that you see.
Ms. Fisher is beginning a lesson about main idea in her second-grade classroom. She tells the students that they are going to be reading an informational text about prairie dogs. To begin, she tells students that she is going to read a few statements about main idea. Using individual whiteboards, the students draw a check mark if the statement is true or an X if it is not true. The students hold up their whiteboards after each statement. Next, Ms. Fisher provides an explanation of main idea, addresses common misconceptions, and the class begins reading the text.

The class reads a few paragraphs together, and then Ms. Fisher models the skill by thinking aloud about the main idea. Then students begin to practice the skill. After reading a few more paragraphs, Ms. Fisher asks them to turn and talk to share the main idea with a neighbor. As students discuss, she moves around the room listening to their conversations. If she hears students share details of the story, she reminds them that details support the main idea and asks them to think again about the main idea. The class engages in multiple rounds of reading and discussing while Ms. Fisher circulates and listens. Using a checklist, she places a check next to each student’s name if she hears them correctly summarizing the main ideas or explaining main idea correctly to their partner. She puts a star next to student names if they confuse details with main idea or are not able to summarize the main idea.
To wrap up the lesson, Ms. Fisher asks students questions about main idea. Her questions include the following: What is the main idea? How does finding the main idea help us when we are reading? How can we find the main idea? What supports the main idea in a story? Finally, she gives students an exit ticket. For the exit ticket, Ms. Fisher provides a new text that students read on their own. As they finish the reading, students write a 2-sentence summary of the main idea.

Best Practices for Using Formative Assessments






#### Practice 1: Bellringer Analysis





#### Practice 2: Partner Analysis

Read the scenario below. As you read, look for formative assessments the teacher uses. Underline every instance of a formative assessment that you see and then use the graphic organizer to analyze each assessment.
Ms. Terrance’s class is learning to tell time to the nearest five minutes. As a bellringer, she asks students to list their five times tables as quickly as possible. She tells them they have 60 seconds to write as many multiples of five as they can.
After the bellringer is over, Ms. Terrance guides students in a discussion to review what they already know about the clock. Her questions include: Each number on the clock represents how many minutes? How many fives does it take to get all the way around the clock? How do you show time on a clock? Ms. Terrance moves into guided practice as she moves the minute hand around the clock and asks students as a whole group to read the time at each five-minute interval. She then shows the clock face with different times and asks individuals to use their white boards to write the corresponding time. Ms. Terrance keeps track of who is getting the times right and who is not. She shows students the correct answer after each problem.
After their whole group discussion and practice, Ms. Terrance provides students with a practice set to work on in partners. The practice set includes two types of problems: times (like 7:35) and clock faces. For the times, students draw the clock face. For the clock face, students write the times.
At the end of class, Ms. Terrance asks for a thumb up, thumb sideways, or thumbs down depending on how students are feeling about the lesson and then provides an exit ticket that shows a number of clock faces. Individually, students record the corresponding time.
