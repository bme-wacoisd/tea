### Lesson 3.05: Introduction to Asset-Based Approaches

Name:
Date:
For the scenario below, describe how a teacher using asset-based teaching would respond to the student.
Scenario:
Luis is an English learner in Ms. S.’s fifth grade class. During science, she gives a class assignment that requires each student to write a paragraph about the experiment the class just completed. Luis writes two words on the page before pushing it away. When Ms. S. checks in on Luis, he says that the other teachers don’t make him write paragraphs because everyone knows he is dumb.
Ms. S. emphasizes that Luis is not dumb and apologizes that anyone has made him feel that way. She lets Luis know that he is capable and that she expects him to complete the same assignments as his classmates. She asks Luis to explain how he chose the two words he wrote on the page. Ms. S. asks, “What else can you tell me about the experiment we completed?” Ms. S. compliments him on his explanation and asks him to write it down. She leaves Luis to write but checks in on him again in a few moments to give feedback. When he has written a complete paragraph, she reads it back to him, compliments him on his hard work, and tells him she looks forward to seeing more work from him.
