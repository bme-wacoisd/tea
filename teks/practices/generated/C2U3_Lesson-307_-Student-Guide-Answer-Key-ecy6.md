How do you think knowing about your students’ backgrounds can help you become a stronger educator and maintain an asset-based view of students?

Knowing about your students’ backgrounds can help you make connections to their life.  You might know what they are interested in, what they find challenging, and what they will know a lot about. Knowing their background can help you understand them more fully and recognize all the experiences and knowledge they bring into the classroom every day.

Excerpted and adapted from González, N., Moll, L., & Amanti, C. (Eds). (2005). Funds of knowledge: Theorizing practices in households, communities and classrooms. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.


Funds of Knowledge Self-Assessment

Where are your funds of knowledge similar?
Where do you bring unique knowledge from your own background and life experiences?

Funds of Knowledge and Instruction
Indicate how each activity calls on student funds of knowledge.
Example #1: Mr. G’s 2nd grade class features a student-expert-of-the-week. The student chooses a way to share one of their strengths or talents with the class during circle time.
The expert of the week activity will position each student as knowledgeable about something in their life The activity will show the range of different student interests and backgrounds and will help the teacher and students know each other better and can potentially lead to examples and lessons that reference or call on this expertise.
Example #2: Ms. J engages in informal conversations with her students to learn more about them and their interests outside of her room.

Ms. J is likely to learn all sorts of things about her students and their backgrounds. She can use this knowledge to choose examples that reflect their lives and design projects that relate to their experiences.

Example #3: Mrs. P’s 7th grade students participate in “free-write Fridays” in which they write for 15 minutes about a topic of their choice. Mrs. P asks questions, responds to journal entries, and invites volunteers to share their writing.

Mrs. P can use this writing to learn about her student background and interests.  She will gain insight into what they are thinking about and enjoy and can highlight their knowledge and experiences.

Some additional ways to call on students’ funds of knowledge include:

- Encouraging students to share about themselves regularly
Asking for multiple perspectives on an idea
Asking for multiple ways to solve problems
Assigning a student expert on a topic
Using classroom jobs to allow students to use their strengths
Selecting examples and nonexamples from students’ interests and hobbies
Allow student choice
