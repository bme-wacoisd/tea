What design considerations have we already learned about that support students who may be exhibiting behavior challenges in the classroom? Brainstorm with a partner. Be prepared to justify your answer.

Answers will vary but might include Intentional color choices can help calm students. Classroom layout that provides easy access to all students and visibility of all students can help a teacher support student with behavior challenges. Intentional choices about what to display on the wall can help students remember what to do if they are struggling. Different types of light can provide a more calming atmosphere than others.



Notes: Calm Down Corners

Definition:

It is. . . “a designated place where students can go when they are feeling overwhelmed or upset. The purpose is to create a safe space where kids can practice self-regulation skills and work to calm themselves.”

It is not. . . “designed to be used as a punishment. Instead, it is designed to be a space that offers students a break from frustration and stress while they work to recover composure.”



Purpose:

Helps keep students in class as much as possible – even when they are having a hard time. Time in class increases student achievement.
Helps students learn to control their emotions and learn to self-regulate.




Best Practices:

- Select a spot in your classroom that is not in a high-traffic area. While you don’t need a large space, make sure there is room for a student to move a bit and the area is relatively free from distractions.
- Use a small rug or seating to define the space and create a comfortable spot for students.
- Add a calming box or toolkit with sensory tools and fidgets that can help students refocus and decompress from the stress they were feeling. Consider adding a visual timer if you feel students may be likely to abuse the space.
- Add purposeful decorations and signs to help students select and utilize calming strategies.



My Future Classroom – Classroom Design
- Use a separate sheet of paper to design your future classroom. You might consider classroom layout, a variety of learning spaces, colors and lighting, strategies for organization, bulletin boards, type of grouping and learning activities, types of transitions, a calm corner, and classroom technology.
- In the space below, write 2–3 paragraphs to explain your classroom design and how it will help create a safe and effective classroom environment.
