### Bellringer

- Describe a time you were given a difficult learning task. Choose one of the following prompts for reflection:
- How was the task structured to support your success in completing the difficult task? To what extent were you successful? How did you feel at the end of the task?
- What supports were missing from the task that led to a lack of success? How did you feel at the end of the task?

### Guideline: Comprehension


| Comprehension |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guideline | Examples | Nonexamples |
| Guide information processing and visualization | Give explicit prompts for each step in a process Chunk information into smaller elements | Introduce a new problem and ask students to solve without guidance Walk students through solving a problem without pausing at after each step. |

## Slide 11

### Guideline: Comprehension


| Comprehension |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guideline | Examples | Nonexamples |
| Maximize transfer and generalization | Incorporate explicit opportunities for review and practice Provide opportunities to apply learning to new situations, such as scenario-based problems Prompt the use of mnemonic devices | Leave old learning behind as new units and lessons are introduced. Ask students to practice similar problems to support memorization of the steps |

## Slide 12

### KWL SChart

- KWL Chart – used to activate prior knowledge
- Before beginning a new topic, at the beginning of a lesson to review the previous day’s lesson, at a transition from one topic to another related topic
- 12

---

## Slide 13

### Concept Map

- Concept Map – to make connections between ideas and concepts
- Before beginning a new lesson to see what students already know, during or at the end of a lesson to provide opportunities for students to process readings, discussions, activities, etc.
- 13

## Slide 14

### Annotating Texts

- Annotating Texts – helps students identify most important parts and consider their own prior knowledge
- When students are reading texts to learn new content or to apply skills, when students are reading and providing peer feedback on texts written by their peers
- 14

## Slide 15

### Step by Step Directions

- Step by Step Directions – Breaks information into smaller pieces, provides process for visualization
- When a new skill includes multiple steps, when an activity includes multiple steps
- 15

## Slide 16

### KWL Chart

- Graphic Organizers- Help highlight key features and relationships
- During discussions, videos, readings, etc. to provide opportunities for students to record new information in a logical way.

## Slide 17

### Exit Ticket

- What are the three guidelines for representation? How does each guideline provide access to rigorous content for all students?
- Read the scenario below and then answer the related questions.
- Mr. M is about to teach his students about the life cycle of a frog. First, Mr. M shows an image of a frog on the screen. Then, he tells students that they are going to be learning about life cycles by learning about frogs. Next, Mr. M reads a nonfiction book about the life cycle of a frog. As he reads, he pauses to show images of each of the steps in the life cycle and uses his life cycle wheel to show students where they are in the life cycle.
- How does Mr. M incorporate options for comprehension?
- What else could Mr. M add to incorporate additional options for comprehension to provide access to rigorous content for all students.
