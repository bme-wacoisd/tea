| 5 mins | Bellringer How do relationships with trusted adults help students in school? Outside of your immediate family, who is the adult in your life do you trust the most? Why do you trust them? | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 Mins | Bellringer Debrief  T: Would anyone like to share about the adult in your life that you trust the most and why?  S: (Share out, if comfortable.)  T: Thank you! Having a trusted adult can not only impact a child’s personal relationships but can also impact their self esteem and their performance in school.  T: How do relationships with trusted adults help students in school?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: It is important for  students to feel that they can trust adults in their lives, especially when they are at school. Let’s brainstorm together—what are some roles that adults have in schools that lend themselves towards building safe, trusting relationships with students?  S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
| 10 mins | Introduction to School Roles  T: Let’s talk more about the roles in your list as well as some additional roles that you didn’t mention. I’m going to add a few roles to your list. (Add roles as necessary to ensure the list includes the following: counselors, social workers, media specialists, Special Education teachers, teacher assistants, ELL teachers.)  T: What do each of these roles do and what do they know and understand about students? Let’s start with counselors.  What is the role of counselors and what do they know and understand about students?   S: Counselors support students emotionally. They might know background information about a student’s home life or behavior. In the later grades, they might know about a student’s career goals and might help them determine the best steps to take to get where they want to go.     T: It is important to know that there is some information that guidance counselors have that is considered sensitive. That means that guidance counselors may not be able to disclose certain information to teachers or other adults in the school. Typically, counselors can discuss academic goals with teachers, especially when the student is part of the discussion.   T: Resource teachers are those teachers such as ELL Teachers, Special Education Teachers, Reading/Literacy Specialists, Math Specialists who provide strategies for teaching different populations or specific content areas. How can a teacher use these teachers to support instruction in their classroom?   S: They can communicate with the teacher about the progress they’re seeing in their classes, discuss areas in which students may need additional emphasis, etc.  T: School social workers have jobs like guidance counselors in the fact that they sometimes handle very sensitive information that they cannot discuss with teachers directly. However, they do provide Support to students outside of school with family and community and can provide mental health services as well. If a student is working with a social worker, they can attend meetings and disclose non-confidential information that might help teachers connect with or better instruct the student.  T: Previous teachers are also a resource that can help teachers greatly in understanding their students and building relationships. How do you think previous teachers can be leveraged for instructional purposes?  S: Answers will vary but may include: previous teachers can inform on student’s strengths and opportunities for growth, successful strategies, seating arrangements, hobbies, interests, performance on tests and assignments, grouping preferences.  T: Why should teachers use caution when soliciting previous teachers for insight about their current students?   S:  If the previous teacher did not have a positive relationship with the student, the current teacher should consider that when collecting information. The teacher may apply their bias towards the student in their assessment of how the current teacher should approach situations.  T: Enrichment teachers, such as art, music, and PE teachers or librarians may have longer-established relationships with the students, as they may have already taught the student once (or multiple times). These teachers are important to communicate with because they can provide insight into students’ areas of strength that a content teacher may not see right away. For instance, if a student is doodling a lot in math class, the teacher may learn by talking to the art teacher that the student is a talented artist. The teacher may use that information to bring art examples into their instruction.  T: Lastly, after school program teachers, as well as club advisors and athletic coaches, can provide a lot of important insight to teachers. They are another good resource for classroom teachers to learn about student personalities, talent, and interests. Collaborating with them can help teachers find more ways to motivate students.  T: When you think about leveraging school roles to support instruction, it is also important to consider professionalism in how you interact with these professionals. Remember, many of these support professionals work with hundreds of students, so their time and expertise should be respected.  T: Here are some tips for how to build partnerships with school and community support professionals: Build relationships with colleagues. Understand the colleague’s role. Ask questions about ways that their work can be supported by your role as the teacher. Respect their time. Arrange a time to meet. Preplan questions.  Send questions in advance if possible. Unless you have a good relationship with that colleague, do not assume they have time to meet. Respect their expertise. Ask questions and listen. Be mindful to maintain an asset-based mindset about your students. another teacher may not have a positive relationship with a student, but you should never pre-judge a student based on that experience. |  |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Ms. L / Joslyn  T: Let’s apply these roles to students in a classroom. Please find Practice 1 on your student guide and read about Ms. L.’s student, Joslyn.  S: (Find and read Practice 1.)  T: Turn and talk with a neighbor about where Ms. L. might go to get some support.   S: (Talk with a partner. Identify colleagues to help Ms. L.) T: Who should Ms. L reach out to regarding her concerns with Joslyn? Why?  S: (Volunteer responses.)  T: (Provide follow up support and questions as necessary.) |  |

| 10 mins | Practice 2: Scenario Analysis  T: Often, colleagues can be your best support for more effectively helping your students. In your Student Guide find Scenarios 1 & 2 under the heading Scenario Analysis. Read these scenarios silently to yourself and brainstorm questions the teachers may want to ask. You have five minutes.  T: (Set timer for five minutes.)  S: (Find and read the practice scenarios.)  T: Now turn to a partner and discuss the who you think each teacher should reach out to and what they should ask. You have five minutes.  T: (Set timer for five minutes.)  S: (Turn and talk about scenarios 1& 2.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Who did you and your partner decide Ms. M should go to for help?   S: The math teacher, the science teacher, and the math enhancement teacher. They can provide insight into what strategies they’re using in class as well as any concerns they have with Joslyn.  T: Great. What about Scenario 2, with Mr. O. Who might Mr. O speak with to best support Eduardo?  S: The ELL and ELA teachers may both be able to help Mr. O understand how Eduardo’s reading comprehension is progressing and strategies to help him better understand the word problems. He could also talk to the PE teacher to see what kinds of physical activities/sports Eduardo likes and how Mr. O could potentially incorporate some sports related word problems into his curriculum. |  |
