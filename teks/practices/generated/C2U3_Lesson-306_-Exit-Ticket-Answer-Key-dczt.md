Name:
Date:
For each scenario, determine whether the teacher is holding high-expectations.

Scenario #1:  A teacher conducts a lesson calling only on the students that raise their hands.  A few students sit quietly in the back doodling on their notebook and not putting forward much effort.
The teacher is not holding high expectations. All students can and should be involved in class discussion and putting forth their best effort.
Scenario #2:  A teacher does not accept answer that are close to correct but instead ask students to explain their thinking and use accurate and precise language to get the fully correct answer.
The teacher is holding high-expectations. They are asking the students to explain their thinking and get to the correct their answers.
Scenario #3:  Students in an 8th grade math class need to learn about Algebra skills.  Many of them also struggle with fractions. The teacher finds ways to offer the students who are struggling with fractions additional chances to practice and get feedback on that skill in their homework while she continues to teach all students the Algebra skills required in 8th grade math.
The teacher is holding high expectations.  Even though some students have some unfinished learning about fractions, she gives them additional opportunities to practice and learn the missing skill.
Scenario #4:  A high school student tells her teacher that she is having relationship troubles with her boyfriend and that it is causing her to be very distracted and that is why she hasn’t been doing her homework. The teacher listens sympathetically, suggests she see the counselor, and then the two of them create a plan for how she will get caught up on her homework and start to get it done on time moving forward.
The teacher is holding high expectations. She is developing a strong, trusting relationship with the student and helping problem-solve to ensure that the student continues learning and putting forth the effort she needs to do to learn despite the challenges in her life.

Describe why holding high expectations for all students is important.
Holding high expectations ensure that you help students achieve at their highest level and that you don’t allow students not to do their very best.

Describe why it is important for students to develop a growth mindset and believe that effort can lead to learning?
Students who believe that effort leads to learning are more likely to put in the effort it takes to learn.
Why is it important to ask students to do their work again when they haven’t put forward their best effort?
You are reinforcing the value of effort and your belief that students can learn the content by making them do it again correctly.
