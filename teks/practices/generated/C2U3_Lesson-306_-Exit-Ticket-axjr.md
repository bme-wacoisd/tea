Name:
Date:
For each scenario, determine whether the teacher is holding high-expectations.

Scenario #1:  A teacher conducts a lesson calling only on the students that raise their hands.  A few students sit quietly in the back doodling on their notebook and not putting forward much effort.




Scenario #2:  A teacher does not accept answer that are close to correct but instead ask students to explain their thinking and use accurate and precise language to get the fully correct answer.




Scenario #3:  Students in an 8th grade math class need to learn about Algebra skills.  Many of them also struggle with fractions. The teacher finds ways to offer the students who are struggling with fractions additional chances to practice and get feedback on that skill in their homework while she continues to teach all students the Algebra skills required in 8th grade math.




Scenario #4:  A high school student tells her teacher that she is having relationship troubles with her boyfriend and that it is causing her to be very distracted and that is why she hasn’t been doing her homework. The teacher listens sympathetically, suggests she see the counselor, and then the two of them create a plan for how she will get caught up on her homework and start to get it done on time moving forward.
