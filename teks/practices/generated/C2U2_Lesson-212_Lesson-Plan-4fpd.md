| Objectives | Identify components of a well-designed classroom  Describe how the physical layout of a classroom contributes to a safe and effective learning environment | Identify components of a well-designed classroom  Describe how the physical layout of a classroom contributes to a safe and effective learning environment | Identify components of a well-designed classroom  Describe how the physical layout of a classroom contributes to a safe and effective learning environment |
| Rationale/ Summary | The environment plays an important role in creating a foundation for effective learning. In this lesson, which is the first part of a 2-part lesson, students will learn about the components of a well-designed classroom and the ways a well-designed classroom contributes to a safe and effective learning environment. | The environment plays an important role in creating a foundation for effective learning.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | On the PowerPoint displayed, there is a picture of a third-grade classroom. Identify what elements of the classroom design help make it a safe and effective learning environment (Consider furniture, materials, and spaces for activities)? Is there anything you would add or take away from the space?  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | On the PowerPoint displayed, there is a picture of a third-grade classroom.

|  | Prior to beginning the lesson, ensure you can access the following video:  Classroom Management-Organize the Physical Classroom For the Exit Ticket, please display the photo found at the following link: Pryor's 3rd Grade Classroom |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Choose either a classroom in which you find it easy to learn or a classroom in which you find it difficult to learn. Describe the classroom in detail. Consider the following questions:  When you are at your desk, what can you see in this classroom?  How is the classroom arranged? How does the arrangement contribute to your (in)ability to learn? What is the mood of the classroom and what about the classroom contributes to this mood? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Quick Discussion: T: Let’s create a class list based on your Bellringer reflections. What factors make it easier or harder to learn in a classroom?   S: Organization, access to materials, access to the teacher, seating arrangements, lighting, wall color, and decorations  T:  In this lesson, you are going to learn more about classroom design and what factors you should consider when designing a classroom to ensure that your design makes it easier – and not harder – for students to learn. We’ll start with a video. Record observations about elements of classroom design discussed in the video on your student guide. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Introduction to a Well-Designed Classroom T: (Show “Classroom Management – Organize the Physical Classroom,” a video from Trifoia.)  S: (Watch and record notes.) T: (Guide students in a discussion of the video.) What factors should the teacher consider when arranging furniture?  S: Access to students, ability to move and monitor, ability to see all students, areas for individual and group work T: How does furniture arrangement impact classroom safety?  S: Access to students provides ability to reinforce behavioral expectations, ability to see all students limits behavior problems, uncluttered arrangement allows for safe movement in the room T: Why is it important to thoughtfully plan where materials are stored?  S: Increases student engagement, limit distractions, smooth transitions, safety, maintenance of materials, limit access to certain materials.  T: What should a teacher remember when decorating a classroom?  S: Balance amount – not too little, not too much, balance kind – posters, knick-knacks, photos, student work, etc.) T: Why is it important to consider the types of activities students will be engaging in?  S: To create effective spaces for the variety of activities, to provide access to quick transitions between activities. Components of Effective Classroom Design T: Now we are going to discuss the components of effective classroom design. (Use the PPT to review elements of effective design.  T: What elements of effective (or ineffective) design stand out in the Bellringer you wrote?  S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide Video: Classroom Management-Organize the Physical Classroom |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Analyze an Example T: Refer to your student guide for the example of an effective classroom layout. (Show the example using the PPT provided.) Consider how each of the elements of the physical classroom layout interact with one another to create this effective classroom design. T: How does the furniture arrangement encourage smooth transitions? S: Desks are arranged so that they can easily be grouped and re-grouped, aisles are provided between desks and other workspaces, desks are arranged so that all students can see the teacher’s presentation space easily, areas are provided for small group work, etc. T: How does the furniture arrangement provide easy access to materials?  S: There is a clear path from each desk to materials, materials are clearly organized into types with space for each type, etc. T: How does the furniture arrangement limit noise and distractions?  S:  Furniture is arranged so that students aren’t looking at each other during whole group activities, small group stations are placed away from individual workspaces, etc. T: How does the material arrangement allow for smooth transitions? S: Materials are easily accessible and, materials are arranged by type so students can quickly find what they need, teacher can easily transition from whiteboard space to other spaces, supply area under windows is spread out so students can access material. T: How does the layout contribute to a safe and orderly classroom? S:  There are clear paths between desks, to material storage, and to alternative workspaces | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Practice 2: Analyze a Non-Example T: (Provide students with a non-example of a classroom layout).  Now, you are going to work with a partner to analyze a non-example.  Remember to annotate the example to identify problem areas of the classroom. Annotations should include circled areas of the layout that are problematic with a sentence explaining the problem.  S: (Work with a partner to annotate the non-example) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: What did you discover:  S: (Students share their annotations with the whole class.)  Teacher’s desk blocks the whiteboard Teacher’s chair faces the whiteboard instead of students so teacher can’t see students Teacher access to students is difficult since desks are so close together; only opening is on the far side from the teacher Student supplies are blocked by small group tables Computer stations are blocked by the locked cabinets so teacher can’t see what is happening Small group tables are too close to student desks – no aisles for teachers or students T:  Now let's review the example and non-example.   T: How are the classroom layouts similar? How are they different? S: (Answers will vary.)  T: What makes one layout more effective than the other? S: (Answers will vary.)  T: What one change would you make to the non-example to make it a more effective layout? S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
