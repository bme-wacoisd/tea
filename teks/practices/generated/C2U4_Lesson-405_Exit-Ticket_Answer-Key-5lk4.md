Lesson 4.05: New Learning is Built on Previous Learning
Name:
Date:


For the following scenarios, explain how the teachers can effectively leverage prior knowledge to support their students’ learning.
Scenario 1: Mrs. P is beginning a new science unit on balancing chemical equations. She asks her class to brainstorm a list of everything they know about equations. She learns that her students recently studied equations in math class. How can this information help her teach her new material?
She can connect what students already know about equations (e.g., balancing, vocabulary, symbols) to the new material.

Scenario 2: Mrs. B gives her students a pretest before beginning a new math unit. The test is 20 questions and, because it is taken on a computer, students receive an immediate score. Mrs. B notices that this activity takes a lot of time, and her students seem unmotivated after receiving their scores. What could Mrs. B do to make this activity a mor effective prior knowledge activity?
She can shorten the number of questions, make sure to keep the activity less than five minutes, and/or not provide a score on the pretest for students.
