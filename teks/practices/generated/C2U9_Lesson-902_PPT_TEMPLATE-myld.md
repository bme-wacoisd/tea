## Slide 3

### Bellringer

- You are a teacher in a math class.  Your students are working on grouping by fives to count to the total.  Each student is asked to first draw a picture of the value, circle the groups of five and use those groups to count by five to get to the answer.  You notice that one of your students is forgetting to circle the groups of five in their drawing which is leading to the incorrect answer.
- What type of informal, verbal feedback might you give that student to get them back on track?  Consider the characteristics of effective feedback we discussed in the previous lesson (specific and clear, focused on the task, strengths and improvements and timely and actionable.)
