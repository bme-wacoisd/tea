### Lesson 9.06: Developing Student Skills for Peer Feedback

Name:
Date:

Bellringer:
Jose just completed a 1:1 student writing conference with his teacher, Mr. Barrier. Mr. Barrier began the conference by greeting Jose and inviting him first to share his thoughts about where his work writing was strong and some areas where he felt he could improve. Jose shared that he feels he really struggles with writing his conclusions but that he does a great job supporting his claims with evidence. Mr. Barrier agreed that providing appropriate and supportive details was a strength of his writing and acknowledged that sometimes it is tough to build a strong conclusion and provided some specific ideas on how Jose might improve. He asked Jose to go back and rewrite the conclusion of his essay based on the feedback. After the conference, Jose felt good and got right to rewriting the conclusion to make it better based on the feedback.

Would you consider this student conference a success? Why?
Yes, it was successful because Jose felt good about it and was clear about how to improve his writing.
How did the conference described above align to the steps for conducting a 1:1 student conference? What evidence supports your conclusion?
Yes, it does. Mr. Barrier greeted the student, invited him to share his thoughts, shared strengths and areas of improvement and set goals for next time.
Was there anything that Mr. Barrier could do better next time?
He could have Jose conduct a reflection after the conference and Mr. Barrier could ask if Jose had any questions or needed clarification before finishing up the conference.
Introduction to Peer Feedback
Peer Feedback: Practice where feedback is given by one student to another.
Benefits of Peer Feedback:
Learners develop a deeper understanding of the task and its requirements.
Provides an opportunity for students to learn from one another.
Feedback from peers is often received more positively than from teachers.
Students have an opportunity to take control of their learning.
Considerations for Utilizing Peer Feedback in the Classroom
- Create a safe environment.
- Explain the process and purpose for the feedback.
- Teach what effective feedback looks like
- Provide a clear structure for providing feedback.
- Make sure that the way that you teach about feedback is appropriate for the grade level.
- Choose a task broader in nature: no right/wrong answer tasks.
- Make sure the success criteria for the task are clear.
Steps for Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies
Explain the peer feedback process and purpose of the feedback.
Introduce the task & success criteria for the task.
Introduce the strategy and process for feedback.
Explain what effective feedback looks like.
Provide scaffolds such as handouts or table charts to keep students on track.
Have students reflect on the feedback and next steps.


Model-Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies

Scenario: Ms. Brice is a 3rd grade teacher who is teaching science. She assigned the students a task where to create a children’s book all about the different forms of energy in everyday life. Within the book, students were to introduce mechanical, light, sound and heat/thermal forms of energy and provide a real-life example of each. The target age group for the book is 5–8-year-olds. The students have just completed their first draft plans for the book and Ms. Brice now wants them to receive some feedback from their peers before completing the final draft.


Practice: Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies
Scenario: Mr. Percy is a 3rd grade math teacher. His students are working on a project where they are collecting, organizing, displaying, and interpreting data. The students have collected data on a question of their choice such as the different types of shoes each student had in the class. After collecting the data, the students had to think of the categories they would use to organize the data and create a graph that helps to display the data. Finally, the students worked to create a poster that included the question, data set and graph along with a summary of the data (What they found out.)  Mr. Percy wants to provide an opportunity for the students to give feedback to each other on their work and has chosen the “TAG” strategy to introduce.

Reflection:
- What did you do well in your model?

- What places do you need more practice/improvement?


- What changes would you make to your model now that you have done it that could make it stronger?



| Teaching Peer Feedback Steps | Examples from the Model |
| --- | --- |
| Explain the process and purpose of feedback. | Reminding the students about their task and telling them they would get a chance to get feedback from a partner. Told them the feedback will help them to make their books even better before the final drafts. |
| Introduce the task & review success criteria | Reminded the students about the book they were working on and all the requirements for the book |
| Introduce the strategy and process for feedback | Went through each section and explained what TAG meant. Showed a picture and then pointed out the sentence starters under each section to help give feedback. |
| Explain what good feedback looks like | Gave them specific, kind, and helpful. Provided examples and non-examples of each. |
| Provide scaffolds | Provided a handout of TAG strategy along with the sentence frames for the students to record their feedback. |
| Students reflect on next steps | Told the students that they will think about what changes they could make to their drafts to make them better after the feedback |
