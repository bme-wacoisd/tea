### Lesson 2.01: Classroom Management Defined

Name:
Date:
Consider the following classroom scenario, identify components of classroom management, and provide your reasoning.
While working in small groups, at tables that have been specifically grouped to be conducive to collaboration, the teacher notices that Xavier seems to be daydreaming. He is staffing out the window and fidgeting with his pencil while his partners are working through the task.  The teacher initially circulates throughout the classroom, before pausing close to Xavier for a few moments, then resumes moving throughout the classroom.  The teacher is validated that the instructional design and work task are appropriate based on the level of engagement of all other students, yet Xavier continues to look out the window.  As other student groups begin completing the assignment and transition effortlessly across the well-designed classroom layout to place stickers on progress charts, the teacher again approaches Xavier, but this time crouches down to his eye-level and quietly says in a neutral tone, “Xavier, eyes on me.  This task is where you and your team show your strengths and your challenges.  Please use this time productively with your team.  That way I can help you and your team with challenges, and we can celebrate your successes.  Please pickup your paintbrush and continue working on your component of the assignment.”
Exemplar responses will vary but should highlight the teacher's proactive approach to behavior management, instructional design, and classroom design.  Exemplar responses will also reference the teacher’s responsive strategies for proximity control, positive reinforcement, intervention, and redirection.
