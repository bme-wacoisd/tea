As Ms. G. puts her belongings in her car, she can hear Ms. W. crying and yelling about how her son is using drugs. Ms. G. feels badly that Ms. W. is going through such a tough situation. The next day, Ms. G. speaks with Ms. W.’s teacher assistant. She tells the assistant about what she saw and heard and asks her to be as helpful as possible to Ms. W.

- She also could have looked up what resources are provided to school employees and gave the information to Ms. W.
- Ms. M.’s mother has been on the local school board for five years. Recently, the board fired the district’s superintendent, and there was a great deal of media coverage about the dismissal. At parent-teacher night, several parents corner Ms. M. about why her mother would have voted to fire the superintendent. Ms. M. shares what her mother told her about the previous superintendent’s misconduct, which is information that also appeared in the local newsletter.
- Did Ms. M. follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics? Explain your answer.
- She did. Since the information she shared was publicly available, she hasn’t violated the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics.
- If Ms. M. did follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics, did she still act unprofessionally? Explain your answer.
- Since the topic involves personnel decisions and the role of Ms. M.’s mother in making those decisions, she should not have commented on the decision.

- Responses may vary but may include:
- She could have told the parents that it was not appropriate for her to comment on her mother’s decisions as a board member.
- She could have left the conversation and found a school administrator to support her.
