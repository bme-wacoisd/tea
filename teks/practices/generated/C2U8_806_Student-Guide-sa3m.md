Lesson 8.06: Putting it All Together | Multiple Means of Engagement
Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Ms. K is having a difficult time engaging all students in her daily lessons. She uses pictures and videos during her lessons and places students in groups to work together on assignments, but students still seem to be disinterested in the instructional resources, unmotivated to complete the group work, and bored with the topics being discussed. What are three strategies she could use to address these problems?




Practice – Lesson Analysis
Work in groups of three to analyze a video lesson from a middle school PE class.  Within your group of 3, each person will choose which means of engagement you want to look for during the lesson – recruiting interest, sustaining effort/persistence or self-regulation. Each group member will look for evidence of just that means of engagement as you watch the video lesson. After your group watches the video lesson focusing on just your chosen means of engagement, you will all come back together as a group to share your evidence.  With your group, determine how those guidelines come together to build student engagement and understanding.
