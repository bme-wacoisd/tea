Keys to Positive Reinforcement – Examples and Nonexamples




Practice 1: Analyze Positive Reinforcement in Action

Watch each video and note how each teacher used positive reinforcement to acknowledge and praise student actions. Record your observations in the chart below.



What was different about the ways the two teachers delivered their positive reinforcement?


Practice 2: Plan and Deliver Positive Reinforcement
Work with a partner to write 3 scripts for each direction below that a teacher might use to reinforce the behaviors and/or actions they want students to demonstrate for each direction. After you have completed your scripts, get with another partner to practice delivering one of your positive reinforcement statements.
