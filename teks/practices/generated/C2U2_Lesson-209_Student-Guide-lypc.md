Notes on Talk Aspirations

List the elements of an effective Talk Aspiration







Note the different ways Talk Aspirations can be used.



In order for a teacher to effectively use Talk Aspirations, what must they do first?




Practice 1: Analyze Challenge in action
How does Mr. Burmeister motivate his students using Talk Aspirations?



How have your teachers motivated you?











Practice 2: Upgrade the nonexample
Work with a partner to revise the following statement from Texas TLAC Online to make it a Talk Aspirations statement. Remember to use Economy of Language when developing your statement.

Scenario: The teacher poses a challenging question to the class. A student responds correctly, but the response lacks precision and academic vocabulary. The teacher says, “Close. Try that again.”

Revised Statement:


Practice 3: Delivering the Challenge
Partner up with someone new. With your new partner, role play the scenario. Each student will play the “teacher” role while the other partner is the “student” role.

The person in the “teacher” role will use the Talk Aspiration statement they drafted earlier to motivate and inspire the student. The person in the student role will use the feedback rubric below to provide specific feedback to their partner on the alignment to the success criteria.
