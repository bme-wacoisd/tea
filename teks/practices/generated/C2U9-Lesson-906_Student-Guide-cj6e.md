### Lesson 9.06: Developing Student Skills for Peer Feedback

Bellringer:
Jose just completed a 1:1 student writing conference with his teacher, Mr. Barrier. Mr. Barrier began the conference by greeting Jose and inviting him first to share his thoughts about where his work writing was strong and some areas where he felt he could improve. Jose shared that he feels he really struggles with writing his conclusions but that he does a great job supporting his claims with evidence. Mr. Barrier agreed that providing appropriate and supportive details was a strength of his writing and acknowledged that sometimes it is tough to build a strong conclusion and provided some specific ideas on how Jose might improve. He asked Jose to go back and rewrite the conclusion of his essay based on the feedback. After the conference, Jose felt good and got right to rewriting the conclusion to make it better based on the feedback.

Would you consider this student conference a success? Why?


How did the conference described above align to the steps for conducting a 1:1 student conference? What evidence supports your conclusion?


Was there anything that Mr. Barrier could do better next time?

Steps for Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies


Model-Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies

Scenario: Ms. Brice is a 3rd grade teacher who is teaching science. She assigned the students a task where to create a children’s book all about the different forms of energy in everyday life. Within the book, students were to introduce mechanical, light, sound and heat/thermal forms of energy and provide a real-life example of each. The target age group for the book is 5–8-year-olds. The students have just completed their first draft plans for the book and Ms. Brice now wants them to receive some feedback from their peers before completing the final draft.



Practice: Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies
Scenario: Mr. Percy is a 3rd grade math teacher. His students are working on a project where they are collecting, organizing, displaying, and interpreting data. The students have collected data on a question of their choice such as the different types of shoes each student had in the class. After collecting the data, the students had to think of the categories they would use to organize the data and create a graph that helps to display the data. Finally, the students worked to create a poster that included the question, data set and graph along with a summary of the data (What they found out.)  Mr. Percy wants to provide an opportunity for the students to give feedback to each other on their work and has chosen the “TAG” strategy to introduce.






Reflection:
- What did you do well in your model?



- What places do you need more practice/improvement?



- What changes would you make to your model now that you have done it that could make it stronger?
