Name:
Date:

Consider the set of rules below for a 2nd grade classroom. Is this an effective set of classroom rules based on the success criteria? Provide and explain 3 reasons from the success criteria to justify your response. Use specific examples from the rules in your justification.






| Tardies: The child should be in their seat when the bell rings. The door to the classroom will be shut after the bell rings. Three tardies will result in disciplinary actions being taken – loss of participation points or d-hall. Hall Passes: Three hall passes will be given to each student for the year. Hall passes can be used to go to the restroom or to your locker. Late Assignments: All assignments must be turned in on the appointed day of class. Late assignments will lose twenty points each day they are late. Any assignment three or more days late will be counted as a zero. Computer Lab / Internet: Students will not be allowed to surf the Internet. Computer lab is a privilege, not a right. Food and Drinks: All food and drink should be in your backpack at all times. Disciplinary actions will be taken if you are caught with food or drinks. Heading of Assignments: Name, date and period should be included in the top right-hand corner of your assignment. Please do not turn in paper ripped out of spiral notebooks. |
