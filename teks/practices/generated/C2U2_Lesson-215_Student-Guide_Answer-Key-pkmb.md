Answers will vary

Notes on Building Radar

As you watch “Building Radar: Doug Lemov and Jabali Sawicki,” note key points Doug and Jabali discuss that can help a teacher “see the room.”
Make the habit of looking and looking well; identify blind spots; clear and observable directions; practice beforehand

List the three keys to “seeing the room” well:

- Observable directions

- Scanning

- Pastore’s Perch


Practice 1: Video Analysis

As you watch “Building Radar: Amy Youngman” and “Building Radar: Rue Ratray,” listen for clear and concrete directions that tell students what to do. Record your evidence below.

Practice 2: Upgrade the Non-Example
Read the following script.
Script: “Okay, class. Let’s get ready to learn. It is time for us to transition to math.”

Did the teacher use specific, concrete, and observable directions? Provide specific evidence to support your answer.

No, the teacher was vague in her directions and did not clearly explain what “ready to learn” looks like. She should have provided concrete and observable directions for students to see what it means to be “ready to learn.”



Rewrite the script to make the directions specific, concrete, and observable.

Responses will vary but should provide clear instructions that tell students exactly what they need to do. Directions should be observable so the teacher can see if students are meeting the expectations.



| Radar | A classroom management strategy in which the teacher gives clear, observable directions, visually scans the room, and positions themself to be easily seen by students. |
| --- | --- |
| Observable Directions | Directions that allow the teacher to see if students are meeting the expectation |
| Specific | Clearly defined or identified |
| Concrete | Providing specific instructions or actions |


| What does radar look like in the classroom? | What is the impact of radar on the classroom? |
| --- | --- |
| Teacher walking around the room always paying attention to students; teacher has “eyes in the back of his/her head,” teacher catches students doing things right and wrong, student can pay attention to all students even when engaged one-on-one with an individual student. | High expectations for behavior, increased accountability, stronger boundaries, students know what is expected of them and are more likely to follow through. |


| Teacher | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Amy Youngman | Possible response: When I say go, and not before I say go; get out whiteboard, whiteboard marker, and white board eraser. The teacher can easily observe to see if students are getting out the necessary materials. |
| Rue Ratray | Possible response: send these back; take out your book and notebook. The teacher can easily observe to see if students are following instructions. |
