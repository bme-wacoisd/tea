Scenario 3 in your role play activity suggested that the teacher pre-teach the words “material” and “object” to students explicitly but only provided a plan to help the teacher introduce the words material. Write a plan – like the ones provided in your scenarios – to help a teacher introduce the word object to their students. Include at least three steps in the instructional sequence.

Answers will vary but may include the following ideas:
Introduce and say the word out loud. Ask students to say the word out loud.
Introduce the term in Spanish – objeto – and other languages if there are other languages represented by your students.
Show examples and non-examples of objects using pictures or physical items.
