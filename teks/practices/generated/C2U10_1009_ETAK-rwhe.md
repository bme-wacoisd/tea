Mark the following statements as true or false. If false, correct the statement so that it is true.
- It is important for a teacher mentor to have a lot in common with their mentee so they can establish a friendship. False. Mentors and mentees do not necessarily need to have a lot in common and can still have meaningful relationships even if there is a difference in age, gender, race, or interests.

- Mentor teachers usually have several years of experience and can provide guidance to their mentees about academics, classroom management, stress management, work-life balance, and a variety of other topics. True.


- Mentees should not reach out to their mentor teachers with questions since mentor teachers are usually very busy. They should wait for their mentors to reach out to them. False. Mentor and mentee teachers should communicate about a schedule for meeting that works best for them, but if a mentee teacher has a question or is uncertain of something they should always reach out to arrange a time to meet or to ask their question.

- If a beginning teacher is doing a good job, they no longer need a mentor teacher. False. Even when a mentee is successful, there are many things that a mentor teacher can help with. A strong mentor/mentee relationship means that the beginning teacher can feel supported if a problem or question came up in their practice.


- Only beginning teachers need mentors. False. Beginning teachers need a different type of support, but all professional educators need and use mentors, even if informally, as a person to provide them with thought-partnership, emotional support, and for problem solving.

- Mentors often learn as much from their mentees as they teach them. True.


- All mentorships are formal, documented processes. False. Formal mentorship programs are in place to support teachers who may need it, such as beginning teachers, however most mentorships occur informally through developing relationships with other education professionals in the school.
