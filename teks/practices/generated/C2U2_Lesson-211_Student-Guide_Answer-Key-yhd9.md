Think back to Unit 1 and the lessons on rolling out systems and routines. Respond to the following questions based on what you remember from that unit:

- What is the impact of an effective rollout on students?

An effective rollout helps with student buy-in and motivation to follow the system or routine as expected.

- What are the criteria for an effective rollout?

Practice 1: Rolling Out Classroom Rules


Part 1: Return to the list of grade and subject-appropriate classroom rules you drafted in the previous lesson. Make any final revisions (if necessary) and record the list below.







Part 2: Develop a roll-out for each rule based on what you learned during previous lessons on systems and routines. The roll-out should be a brief, positively framed introduction that shares the purpose for the rule and explicitly teaches and models what the rule should look, sound, and feel like. The roll-out is a time for students to practice and model the rules.

Answers will vary based on classroom rules that were drafted.





Part 3: Get into groups of 3-4. In rounds, each group member will play the role of “teacher” to roll-out one of your rules. As the “teacher” presents each of the rules, the other members of the group will play the role of “students” to model and practice the rules as they are presented.

Repeat this process until all group members have had the opportunity to play the “teacher” role. Use the success criteria listed below to provide feedback to your peers.

Success Criteria:
- Clear, concise, and enthusiastic
- Starts with the why

- Pre-empt pitfalls

Debrief Notes
Consider the following questions:

- Why is it important explicitly teach and model classroom rules?

- Explicitly teaching and modeling each classroom rule makes the rule and the teacher’s expectations crystal clear. It provides students the opportunity to see a model of what each rule looks, sounds, and feels and provides opportunities to practice.

- What is the value in having students practice and model the rules as they are introduced?

- Creating opportunities for students to practice the rule until they thoroughly understand what is expected of them helps solidify the rule in their mind. It goes back to the saying “practice makes perfect.” Practice also provides an opportunity for students to receive feedback on correct and incorrect implementation of the rule.

- What might be the impact of implementing rules that haven’t been explicitly taught and modeled?
If a teacher does not explicitly teach and model the classroom rules, it could leave students with misunderstandings or an unclear idea of what the rules look like in action. Also, it leaves room for interpretation or space for students to create their own vision of what the rule looks and sounds like.
