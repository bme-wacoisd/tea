### Lesson 5.11: Characteristics of Effective Summative Assessments | Introduction to Summative Assessment Practices

Name:
Date:
A colleague has shared his draft lesson plans for an upcoming English unit.  He has asked you to provide him some on his summative assessment as you have been working with him to develop more align assessments.  Below are details that he has included regarding his end of unit assessment.
Unit Objectives to be assessed:
- Write clearly and effectively to convey complex ideas
- Cite strong evidence to support analysis
- Determine the theme and central idea
- Demonstrate the understanding of English grammar
- Demonstrate understanding of English conventions
Assessment Description:
Students will be given a test with multiple choice questions to complete based upon details from a recent text they read called Things Fall Apart.  The questions will measure knowledge about key characters in the text, theme, and central idea.  There will be a matching section of the text where students will match quotes from the text to the characters who said those quotes.  They will provide a brief description of why those quotes were important.

Based on the characteristics for effective assessments, what feedback would you recommend to your colleague?
A: Answers may vary.  The teacher should include more in the assessment about writing and needs provide an opportunity for the students to cite strong evidence to support an analysis.  Instead of having a section on matching the quotes from characters, he might draft a question around how the quote is represents the central idea of the text or why it is representative of the character.  Within the question students should have clear criteria about how many pieces of evidence to include and why they are important to consider as evidence.  Also, students in their essay should be prompted to use appropriate English grammar and conventions.
