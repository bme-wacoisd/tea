How do you think knowing about your students’ backgrounds can help you become a stronger educator and maintain an asset-based view of students?

Knowing about your students’ backgrounds can help you make connections to their life. You might know what they are interested in, what they find challenging, and what they will know a lot about. Knowing their background can help you understand them more fully and recognize all the experiences and knowledge they bring into the classroom every day.

Funds of Knowledge Self-Assessment

Where are your funds of knowledge similar?
Where do you bring unique knowledge from your own background and life experiences?





Funds of Knowledge and Instruction
Indicate how each activity calls on student funds of knowledge.
Example #1: Mr. G’s 2nd grade class features a student-expert-of-the-week. The student chooses a way to share one of their strengths or talents with the class during circle time.
The expert of the week activity will position each student as knowledgeable about something in their life The activity will show the range of different student interests and backgrounds and will help the teacher and students know each other better and can potentially lead to examples and lessons that reference or call on this expertise.
Example #2: Ms. J engages in informal conversations with her students to learn more about them and their interests outside of her room.

Ms. J is likely to learn all sorts of things about her students and their backgrounds. She can use this knowledge to choose examples that reflect their lives and design projects that relate to their experiences.

Example #3: Mrs. P’s 7th grade students participate in “free-write Fridays” in which they write for 15 minutes about a topic of their choice. Mrs. P asks questions, responds to journal entries, and invites volunteers to share their writing.

Mrs. P can use this writing to learn about her student background and interests. She will gain insight into what they are thinking about and enjoy and can highlight their knowledge and experiences.

Some additional ways to call on students’ funds of knowledge include:

- Encouraging students to share about themselves regularly.
Asking for multiple perspectives on an idea
Asking for multiple ways to solve problems.
Assigning a student expert on a topic
Using classroom jobs to allow students to use their strengths.
Selecting examples and nonexamples from students’ interests and hobbies
Allow student choice.

| 13 mins | Funds of Knowledge Introduction T: In the last few classes, we have talked about an asset-based view of students and maintaining high-expectations for them.  T: Today, we are going to explore an idea called funds of knowledge. Every student comes to class with a wealth of specific knowledge learned from their family, friends, experiences, and culture. These will vary student by student.   T: (Display the definition of funds of knowledge from the PowerPoint and have students record it in their student guide.)   S: (Students record definition)  T: Let’s take a minute to think about the expression “funds of knowledge”. What do you usually associate with the idea of “funds”?  S: Money.   T: And where do you usually keep money?  S: In a bank.  T: Right – so a good way to think about funds of knowledge is that they are stored ideas that individuals know about – ideas, concepts and understandings that are stored in your long-term memory that can be an asset to you as a student. That knowledge might come from your family activities, traditions, occupations, hobbies, etc.   T: The idea of funds of knowledge came from researchers who realized that often educators were not recognizing the unique knowledge that students come to school with based on their familial and cultural backgrounds (Vélez-Ibáñez and Greenberg (1992)).  T: As teachers, exploring the different funds of knowledge that students come to school with can help you to better see the assets your students bring to the classroom and to design instruction reflective of their life experiences.   T: So, let’s look at a matrix of potential sources of funds of knowledge. Turn in your student guide to the funds of knowledge matrix.  T: As you can see, there are examples of funds of knowledge in the first table. Home Language  Family Values and Traditions Friends and Family Family Outings Household Activities  Educational Activities Favorite TV Shows or Books Family Occupations Scientific Knowledge  T: So, let’s look at some examples of each of these funds of knowledge.  T: (Teacher solicits examples from students while students record examples.)  S: (Students record the examples in the student guide).  T: Students come to class with all sorts of interesting and specialized expertise from just living their lives. Why do you think it is important for teachers to take time to understand this knowledge?  S:  Because it makes students feel valued. Because it might help you provide instruction that reflects the students’ backgrounds and builds off their prior knowledge.  T: Right – for instance, if I know a lot of students go to a particular store to shop, celebrate a particular holiday, or even care about one sports team, I can use these funds of knowledge when I plan instruction or give examples in my teaching. In this way, I am sending the signal to students that I know and value what they are bringing to the classroom.   T: (Display on PPT) Teachers should take an asset-based approach to collecting and using funds of knowledge information by focusing on three big ideas:  Know that funds of knowledge exist for all students: Students’ experiences outside of school are valuable sources of knowledge for the whole class. Every student has them. Be attentive to students: Pay attention and look for knowledge and skills that students may possess. Listen to them and watch for non-verbal reactions when things interest or engage them. Show sincere interest in students’ knowledge and experience: Demonstrate that you are excited to learn more about their life and experiences.    T: Teachers collect Funds of Knowledge information in ways both intentional and informal.  Intentional Surveys Planned conferences. Home visits Project-based assignments that relate to students lives.  Informal Casual conversations Observation during or outside of class (recess, after-school, field trips, etc.)  T: As a teacher, realizing that your students come to school with a rich set of knowledge and figuring out what that knowledge is can help you see them as experts – students come knowing and being able to do many things and have assets that you can tap into. | Student Guide PPT |
| 12 min | Funds of Knowledge Self-Assessment T: We are now going to take some time to identify your funds of knowledge based on the categories above.  T: I’d like you each to take 7 minutes and record the funds of knowledge that you bring to the classrooms on the matrix. Note to teacher: You may want to prepare for this activity by identifying funds of knowledge in your own background as an example.  S: (Student’s fill out Funds on Knowledge matrix)  T: Now let’s pair off and share some of your funds of knowledge.  As you do this, please answer the two questions below in your student guide.  Where are your funds of knowledge similar? Where do you bring unique knowledge from your own background and life experiences?  S: (Students pair off, sharing their self-identified funds of knowledge and answering questions 1 and 2))  T: (Ask students to share some of their unique funds of knowledge)  S: (Students share responses).  T: When I hear you talk about your funds of knowledge, it makes me aware of how much each of you is coming to our classroom already knowing and understanding. How might identifying funds of knowledge help a teacher develop an asset-based mindset?  S: You can hear all the things the students know about and recognize every student comes with lots of knowledge and expertise to build upon. |  |
| 10 mins | Funds of Knowledge and Instruction T: Having knowledge of what your students bring to the classroom can help you design meaningful activities, examples, and discussions that reflect your students lived experience.  T: Let’s look at three examples in our student guide and record how the strategy is helping a teacher collect and use student funds on knowledge.  T: Please look at these three examples and write down how each activity calls on student funds of knowledge. S: (Students record answers in student guide).  T: (Ask students to share out their answers to each of three examples)  T: So, a teacher can design instruction to gather and reflect students’ knowledge. Some additional ways to call on students’ funds of knowledge include:  Encouraging students to share about themselves regularly. Asking for multiple perspectives on an idea Asking for multiple ways to solve problems. Assigning a student expert on a topic Using classroom jobs to allow students to use their strengths.  Selecting examples and nonexamples from students’ interests and hobbies Allow student choice.  T: In conclusion, taking time to identify the funds of knowledge  that students come to the classroom with can help you recognize the knowledge assets that students bring to class and build on that knowledge. | Student Guide |
