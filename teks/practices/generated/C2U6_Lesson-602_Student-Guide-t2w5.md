| 2 | Orally blend syllables and two- and three-phonemes (sounds) to form words | Cup-cake = cupcake /k/ - /i/ -/s/ = kiss |
| 3 | Orally blend sounds to form words | /m/ - /a/ - /t/ = mat |
| 4 | Orally blend and segment sounds in words | Dot = /d/ - /o/ - /t/ |
| 5 | Discriminate between vowel sounds in words | /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/, /o/ |
| 6 | Orally blend sounds to form words | /c/ - /a/ - /t/ = cat |
| 7 | Orally segment words with consonant clusters | clip = /c/ - /l/ - /i/ - /p/ |
| 8 | Review vowel sounds, digraphs, and other sounds and spellings | /sh/, /ch/, /wh/ |
| 9 | Orally blend two-syllable words | /b/ - /e/ - /t/ - /er/ = better |
| 10 | Orally segment two-syllable words | Cupcake = /c/ - /u/ - /p/ - /c/ - /a/ - /k/ |
