## Exit Ticket - Answer Key

### Lesson 4.04:  Practice with Identifying the Most Important Content

Name:
Date:
Examine the goal below and respond to the questions.
Investigate solid materials found at or near Earth’s surface to describe their properties.
- What do students need to know, be able to do, and understand about the content?

Students should know and be able to define physical properties, they should be able to apply their understanding to an examination of materials found at or near Earth’s surface.

- Where do I want to focus my students’ attention?

Student attention should be on the physical properties of the artifacts they are looking at.

Now, examine the lesson plan. Determine whether each activity is aligned to the most important content or not. Provide suggestions for better alignment where necessary.



| Lesson Activity | Aligned to Most Important Content? (Yes/No) | If no, how might the teacher improve the alignment? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bellringer: Examine the three artifacts at the front of the room (artifacts might include dirt, clay, and rock collected from the local landscape). How would you describe each? | Yes |  |
| Introduction to Properties: Students will take notes about properties that can be observed in land samples including color, texture, flexibility, hardness, shape, and size. They will return to their bellringers and add details based on their understanding of the new vocabulary.  Teacher will tell students that the artifacts from the bellringer were very different from one another but most of the time land is made up of a variety of components that may include clay, dirt, rocks, etc., and may be more difficult to describe accurately. | Yes |  |
| Guided Practice – Show students a sample of land taken from the beach. Explain that you can tell the sample was taken from somewhere near water because of the high concentration of sand. Ask students what else they might see in land taken from near water. | No | The teacher should model a description of the sandy sample using the vocabulary and concepts introduced at the beginning of the lesson. |
| Independent Practice – Give students three samples of land/dirt taken from various areas. Working in small groups, they will guess the location of the area based on the components of land they see in the sample. | No | Students should describe the three samples using the vocabulary and concepts introduced at the beginning of the lesson. |
| Exit ticket: Students will independently describe the properties of a final sample of land. | Yes |  |
