Classroom rules should be explicitly ______________ and ______________.
Classroom rules should be implemented in a way that is ___________________, ________________, and _______________________.

Success Criteria for Writing Effective Classroom Rules

Practice 1: Examples and Non-Examples
Classroom Rules Example
Read the rules independently. In the space below, describe how this list aligns with the guidelines for effective rules.






Classroom Rules Non-Example
With a partner, identify how the rules do not meet the guidelines and adjust the rules to improve them. You may add, delete, or change any language.

Why do these rules not align with the guidelines for effective rules?



How can the rules be improved?




With your partner, come up with an upgraded example of rules that could be used in this second grade classroom.

Practice 2: Upgrade the list from the board
Work with a partner to review the list of rules we came up with as a class from the bellringer. Using what we have learned today, revise this list to fit the guidelines for creating effective rules.











Practice 3: Design classroom rules

Consider your future classroom. What grade level would you like to teach? What subject? On your own, develop a set of 3-5 rules for your classroom.
Grade level:
Subject:


| Classroom Rules |  |
| --- | --- |


| Guideline | Reasoning | Example | Nonexample |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Limit Number of Rules (3-5) | Limiting the number of rules makes them easy to remember. |  |  |
| Understandable | Rules must be stated clearly and consistent with students’ age and ability level. |  |  |
| Observable (Easy to monitor) | Rules should be easily monitored and not require excessive classroom time to hold students accountable. |  |  |
| Stated Positively | Stating rules positively encourages the desired behavior. Although it is sometimes difficult to state all rules positively, most “don’ts” can be transformed to “do’s.” |  |  |
| Addresses the Most Important Expectations | Rules should represent high expectations for the key values of the class |  |  |


| Example 1: Middle School Math Class |
| --- |
| Respect yourself, your peers, and their property. Talk at appropriate times and use appropriate voices. Be in your seat and ready for class when the bell rings. Follow directions the first time they are given. |


| Example 2: Second Grade Class |
| --- |
| Ask questions Respect and listen to your classmates Respect and listen to the teacher Raise your hand to speak Look up words you don’t understand No talking when the teacher is talking No talking when classmates are talking Be creative No stealing Follow directions |
