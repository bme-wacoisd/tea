A social studies teacher’s students need to understand the effects of volcanoes in shaping the landscape. Which learning activity would best do this?
Students create a paper mâché volcano, paint it, and make it erupt using baking soda and vinegar
Students read a short article about volcanoes, answer five multiple-choice questions, and draw a picture of a volcano
- Students choose a region whose geography is affected by volcanoes. They collect research from three different approved sources and give a short presentation about their findings.
Use the following table to analyze the three options by answering the following questions: Where will the students’ attention be focused during the learning activity? Do you anticipate students will understand the effects of volcanoes in shaping the landscape after this activity? Why?

Answer Key:
- No. While Rosie was a symbol of women in manufacturing jobs, the activity doesn’t focus on attention to the most important content.
- Yes.  Requires attending to the most important content
- Yes.
- No. This identifies an animal that hibernates – but it does address why animals hibernate.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes
- No.  The activity does not direct students to describe the flow of energy within a food web, including the roles of the Sun, producers, consumers, and decomposers.  Doing this activity does not focus student’s attend on important content.

|  | Where will the student’s attention be focused during the learning activity? | Do you anticipate students will understand the effects of volcanoes in shaping the landscape after this activity? Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a) Students create a paper Mache’ volcano, paint it, and make it erupt using baking soda and vinegar | Student’s attention will be focused on to how to build a paper Mache’ volcano. | No.  They may be having fun, but they don’t get a chance to focus their attention on the processes of volcanoes shaping the landscape. |
| b) Students read a short article about volcanoes, answer five multiple-choice questions, and draw a picture of a volcano | They will pay attention to whatever the text is about, the 5 questions and then, by drawing the volcano, what a volcano looks like. | Not likely.  We don’t know if the article talks about a volcano’s effect on the landscape. Drawing a volcano is not the way to focus on the most important content – effect of volcanos on landscape. |
| b) Students choose a region whose geography is affected by volcanoes. They collect research from three different approved sources and give a short presentation about their findings. | They will focus on how volcanoes change the landscape and geography of the region they choose. | Yes. Only answer C includes learning that aligns to understanding the effects that volcanoes have on the landscape. |


| Learning Goal | Activity | Does the activity focus attention (and therefore the working memory) on the learning goal? Why or why not? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Learning Goal # 1: Analyze how a movie uses color to convey mood. | Have students draw a picture of a scene from one of their favorite movies and use the colors from the film in their drawing being as accurate as possible about matching the colors of the film to the colors in the drawing. | No. While students are paying attention to color, they are not necessarily paying attention to how color effects mood – which is the most important content. |
| Learning Goal # 1: Analyze how a movie uses color to convey mood. | Watch a short clip from a movie that uses bright colors on a sunny day to convey joy; Watch a different clip which is set on a rainy evening with dimly lit, dark-colored interiors. Discuss how color and lighting are connected to what is happening in the film and the overall mood. Cite evidence. | Yes.  The activity is deliberately selecting passages wherein colors are connected to moods and helping the learner focus their attention on the connection between the mood and color. |
| Learning Goal #2: Identify different components of the muscular system and their function | Draw a picture of a muscular person. Share with a partner why you think muscles are important. | No. Drawing a picture and sharing about muscles doesn’t focus attention on the components of the system. |
| Learning Goal #2: Identify different components of the muscular system and their function | Using diagrams and a table of the important components of the muscular system (including types of muscles and muscle cells, voluntary and involuntary muscle, etc.), review each part of the muscular system and what purpose it serves in the larger system. | Yes.  This activity focuses attention on the actual components of the muscular system and what they do. |
| Learning Goal #3 Students will solve real-world problems using division with fractions and mixed numbers. | Students learn a rhyme to memorize the algorithm for dividing with fractions. They practice the steps by solving several computation-only problems (no word problems). | Students’ attention is focused on the rhyme and on memorizing a formula. Because of the computation-only problems, they get no practice in real-world application or on the concept of division. |
| Learning Goal #3 Students will solve real-world problems using division with fractions and mixed numbers. | Students read real-world problems that require fraction division. They solve each problem by drawing a model and using the algorithm. For each problem, students explain how they know their answer makes sense. | Students’ attention is focused on the learning goal. This activity engages them in real-world situations, how to set up a division problem, how dividing with fractions works, and how to evaluate if an answer makes sense. |
| Learning Goal #4: Identify words that are part of a homophone pair. | Write out the definition of a homophone and explain how you can use the parts of the word homophone to see that it means “same sound.” | No. The goal isn’t to understand the definition of a homophone or where the word comes from. |
| Learning Goal #4: Identify words that are part of a homophone pair. | Which of these words is part of a homophone pair?  Ball. Stork. Ad. Too. Night. Rice. | Yes. This activity will require the learner to actively pay attention to which words are part of a homophone pair by testing their understanding. Attention and the working memory will be busy engaged in the actual task of identifying homophones of the words. |


| Requires attending to the most important content | Misaligned to the most important content |

| (A) Learning Goal  Describe the effect of World War II on the role of women in the economy and how it changed ideas about women’s role in the  society. | Activity  Draw a picture of Rosie the Riveter. |
| --- | --- |


| (B) Learning Goal  Describe the effect of World War II on the role of women in the economy and how it changed ideas about women’s role in the society. | Activity  Examine four short narrative accounts from women who moved into manufacturing jobs because men were off fighting the war. Find evidence in their accounts of how the experience changed perceptions in society. |
| --- | --- |


| (C) Learning Goal  Compare physical properties of matter. | Activity  Take three objects – a rock, silly puddy, and a feather. Using your senses and a three-column chart, record observations about the object’s properties (weight, flexibility, surface quality, etc.) and explain their differences. |
| --- | --- |


| (D) Learning Goal  Identify why some animals hibernate. | Activity  Draw a picture of three animals that you know hibernate.  Label your drawing with the animal’s scientific name and where they live in North America. |
| --- | --- |


| (E) Learning Goal  Write a persuasive essay citing evidence to convince the reader. | Activity  Identity a musical artist who you believe is the most talented artist today.  Write an essay in which you select the artist and cite at least 3 pieces of evidence as to why you think they are the most talented. |
| --- | --- |


| (F) Learning Goal  Play three chords on a guitar. | Activity  Watch a YouTube video of a guitarist demonstrating the G, C and D chords.  Get your guitar and try to form the chords and strum. Stop the video to look closely at how the fingers are arrange on the guitar. Practice the 3 chords. |
| --- | --- |


| (G) Learning Goal  Multiply single digit numbers fluently (e.g., know immediately that  3 x 4 = 12) | Activity  Engage in a 5-minute quiz in which students practice their times tables. For example  4 x 5 = ?  7 x 3 = ? |
| --- | --- |


| (H) Learning Goal  Describe the flow of energy within a food web, including the roles of the Sun, producers, consumers, and decomposers. | Activity  Research  the animal of your choice using the internet to understand what the animals eats and draw a picture of what the animal in their environment including what they eat. |
