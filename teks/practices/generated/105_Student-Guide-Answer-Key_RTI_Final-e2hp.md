Think about our classroom routine for transitioning from work with a partner or a group back to whole-group instruction. Develop a set of effective directions for this routine.
Student answers will vary based on the class’s routine for this activity.


Review: Build a Rubric for Effective Directions

Practice 1: Feedback on Partner-Developed Directions


Practice 2:
Scenario 1:
Ms. North’s high school English class will be spending a class period in the school media center to work on their research projects. There are not enough computers for everyone to complete online research at the same time. She wants everyone to be able to have some time to work at the computer and some time to consult other resources in the media center.
Develop effective instructions for Ms. North to provide when her class arrives at the media center.
Student answers may vary but may include:
- Everyone should sit at one of the tables in the center of the media center.
- We will divide into two groups. If your last name starts with A-L, you are in group 1. If your last name starts with M-Z, you are in group 2.
- Everyone in group 1, please raise your hand.
- Everyone in group 2, please raise your hand.
- The teacher checks to make sure students are raising their hands at the correct time.
- Now, only those in group 1 should stand up and move to one of the computer stations. Those in group 2 should remain seated.
- Now, those in group 2 should get up and gather no more than three sources from the other sections of the media center.
- Halfway through class, the teacher can send each group back to the tables in the center of the media center and repeat the directions to switch them between the computer stations and other resources.
Student feedback captured in the rubric below will vary based on the effectiveness of the instructions developed.

Scenario 2:
Ms. South’s fourth grade students have been outside for recess. Some of them played basketball, while others played on the playground. She wants the students who played basketball to put the balls in a large bin near the door to the school. She then wants all students to line up outside the door before walking back to the classroom.
Develop effective instructions for Ms. South to provide when recess is over.
Student answers may vary but may include:
- The teacher stands in-between the basketball court and the playground.
- She blows a whistle and put up her hand. She stays like that until all students have stopped moving and put up their hands.
- When I say “Go!” all students who played on the playground should walk to the door and line up against the building. Students on the basketball court should stay in place. Go!
- Now, students on the basketball court, if there is a basketball near you, pick it up. If there isn’t, stay in place.
- The teacher makes sure that all basketballs have been picked up.
- When I say “Go!” walk to the door. If you have a basketball, put it in the bin and then line up. If you don’t, line up as soon as you get back to the building. Go!
