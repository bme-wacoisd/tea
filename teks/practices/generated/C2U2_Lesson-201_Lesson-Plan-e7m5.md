| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Consider the following classroom scenario, identify components of classroom management, and provide your reasoning.  While working in small groups, at tables that have been specifically grouped to be conducive to collaboration, the teacher notices that Xavier seems to be daydreaming. He is staffing out the window and fidgeting with his pencil while his partners are working through the task.  The teacher initially circulates throughout the classroom, before pausing close to Xavier for a few moments, then resumes moving throughout the classroom.  The teacher is validated that the instructional design and work task are appropriate based on the level of engagement of all other students, yet Xavier continues to look out the window.  As other student groups begin completing the assignment and transition effortlessly across the well-designed classroom layout to place stickers on progress charts, the teacher again approaches Xavier, but this time crouches down to his eye-level and quietly says in a neutral tone, “Xavier, eyes on me.  This task is where you and your team show your strengths and your challenges.  Please use this time productively with your team.  That way I can help you and your team with challenges, and we can celebrate your successes.  Please pickup your paintbrush and continue working on your component of the assignment.”  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Consider the following classroom scenario, identify components of classroom management, and provide your reasoning.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Respond to the following prompts:  Reflect on what we’ve learned about classroom culture and an effective learning environment. What do you think of when you hear the term Classroom Management? | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Intro to Classroom Management T: This unit will focus on classroom management includes the skills and techniques that teachers use to create a safe, organized, and positive learning environment. We are going to use a graphic organizer to help us understand classroom management. Take a minute to review the graphic organizer on your student guide.  S: (Read the graphic organizer.)  T: What do you notice about how the graphic is organized?  S: Student relationships is on the outside of the circle, then proactive, then responsive.  T: Classroom management begins with a foundation of positive teacher and student relationships. When there are strong relationships, the classroom operates smoothly and there is more time for learning.   T: (Model annotation by writing a note about the importance of positive teacher and student relationships on the graphic organizer.)  S: (Add a note to the graphic that without building trusting relationships with students, the rest of the classroom management plan will be difficult to implement.)  T: Let’s think a little bit more about classroom management, specific management strategies, and what you may already know.  T: (Model how to annotate the graphic with one example. Students will: Circle any terms with which they are not familiar.  Place a star by any terms for which they can explain and identify an instructional strategy.)   T: Take a couple minutes to review the graphic again and annotate based on what you already know and what you may be unfamiliar with.  S: (Work individually for 2 minutes to review and annotate the graphic.)  T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. If you are in an odd numbered row, turn to your left. If you are in an even numbered row, turn to your right.  S: (Turn and talk to share their annotations with a partner.)  T: (Define key ideas in the outer circle of the graphic organizer using the PPT to define terms.)   S: (Take notes in the chart below the graphic organizer.)  T: (Lead students in a discussion of the strategies for building positive relationships). When do teachers start building positive relationships with students?  S: Day 1 and it continues all year.  T: What should teachers do to build relationships with students?   S: Be consistent and fair, listen to students, show concern for them, learn more about them.  T: What does it look like when a teacher has high expectations for ALL the students?   S: Calling on all students, asking higher-order questions, demand effort and engagement, encourage productive struggle—don’t give away answers too soon.  T: Why is it important for a teacher to be calm AND consistent?   S: Create a safe culture, ensure fairness. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Definitions and Strategies  T: Remember that building positive relationships is the foundation to classroom management. Proactive classroom management refers to planned strategies that encourage positive behavior and maximize learning time. Responsive classroom management refers to the teacher’s response to student behavior.  T: (Lead the students through the rest of the graphic. Define each proactive technique using the PPT. Ask students to consider and record examples they may already know on their graphic organizer.)  S: (Record examples of related strategies they have observed or learned about.)  T: (Define each responsive technique. Ask students to record examples.)  S: (Record examples of related strategies they have observed or learned about.)  T: Now that we have defined proactive and responsive strategies to classroom management, you are going to work in your routine design groups from the last unit to share and brainstorm additional strategies and techniques you have seen teachers use. Share the examples you recorded individually and work together to add more.  S: (With their routine design groups, students brainstorm strategies and techniques they have seen teachers use to manage their classrooms.)  T: What do these practices look like in a classroom? (Use Basketball Questioning to “bounce” the ideas around the classroom. Begin with one design group who will share their responses for one of the components of the graphic.  Then, ask other design groups to respond to what was presented either by elaborating on an idea they heard or adding a new idea. “Bounce” to each design group to elaborate or add until all design groups have shared.  Begin another round with a new component of the graphic organizer and a new starter group. Repeat for all components of the graphic organizer.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Debrief: T: Why do you think the Classroom Management graphic is organized and layered the way that it is?”    S: The components in the outer layer are essential. They form the base and are essential in all components of good classroom management. Proactive strategies support the base to minimize disruptions. Responsive strategies are on the outside because they are used only when necessary, based on student behavior. | Student Guide |
