| Rationale/ Summary | Professionalism as an educator is a key to a successful career. To behave professionally, educators must follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics. In this lesson, students will review the purpose of an educator code of ethics and how it establishes expectations for ethical conduct. They will consider examples and non-examples to build their understanding of the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics. Finally, they will consider scenarios to discern when a teacher acts unprofessionally from when they have violated the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics. | Professionalism as an educator is a key to a successful career.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Review the following scenarios and respond to the questions. Ms. G. is walking to her car in the parking lot, and she sees someone on their cell phone in the car next to hers. The person is Ms. W., another teacher at the school. As Ms. G. puts her belongings in her car, she can hear Ms. W. crying and yelling about how her son is using drugs. Ms. G. feels badly that Ms. W. is going through such a tough situation. The next day, Ms. G. speaks with Ms. W.’s teacher assistant. She tells the assistant about what she saw and heard and asks her to be as helpful as possible to Ms. W. Did Ms. G. follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics? Explain your answer. If Ms. G. did follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics, did she still act unprofessionally? Explain your answer.  If Ms. G. did not follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics or otherwise acted unprofessionally, what should she have done differently?  Ms. M.’s mother has been on the local school board for five years. Recently, the board fired the district’s superintendent, and there was a great deal of media coverage about the dismissal. At parent-teacher night, several parents corner Ms. M. about why her mother would have voted to fire the superintendent. Ms. M. shares what her mother told her about the previous superintendent’s misconduct, which is information that also appeared in the local newsletter. Did Ms. M. follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics? Explain your answer. If Ms. M. did follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics, did she still act unprofessionally? Explain your answer.  If Ms. M. did not follow the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics or otherwise acted unprofessionally, what should she have done differently?

|  | Today’s lesson will focus on building student understanding of more nuanced standards in the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics. As an example, Standard 3.6 indicates that “The educator shall not solicit or engage in sexual conduct or a romantic relationship with a student or minor.” This standard is not nuanced, and understanding it simply requires maturity and common sense. As a result, it is not included in this lesson. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Think back to your time in Principles of Education & Training. What do you remember learning about the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics? If you’re having trouble remembering the topic, what do you think would be included in the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Bellringer Review T: Can I have some volunteers share their answer to the bellringer? It’s okay if you don’t remember this topic from Principles of Education as we’ll be reviewing it today.  S: Responses may vary but may include: It tells educators what they can and cannot do. It helps everyone understand what it means for educators to act ethically. Teachers need to follow the law, be honest, and have good morals.  T: (Call on 5-6 student volunteers to share responses to the bellringer.) | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Notes: Review of Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics  T: Before we discuss the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics, let’s discuss some general ideas related to ethics. Ethics is the set of moral principles that govern a person’s behavior or actions.  S: (Add definition to table in Student Guide.)  T: When ethics guide a person, the person is demonstrating ethical behavior. Ethical behavior is respecting and obeying the law, being honest and demonstrating good moral character, and being equitable and fair to all.  S: (Add definition to table in Student Guide.)  T: In that definition though, there are some terms that can mean different things to different people. You might define “good moral character” differently than I do. We also might have different ideas of that it means to treat others fairly. We need to have a shared understanding about what terms like these mean. For educators, that shared understanding can be found in the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics.  T: The Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics is a legal document that outlines an educator’s responsibilities to students and provides standards by which to judge ethical and professional conduct.  S: (Add definition to table in Student Guide.)  T: The Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics is divided into three sections, with each covering an element of educator behavior. They are: Professional Ethical Conduct, Practices and Performance Ethical Conduct Toward Professional Colleagues Ethical Conduct Toward Students. Add these to the “Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics” section of your Student Guide.  S: (Add three elements to Student Guide.)  T: The Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics is part of Texas law. The state’s legislature put the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics into place, and they can also vote to change it. For example, there is now a standard on social media that was not there when the legislature developed the original Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics.  S: (Complete blanks in Student Guide.)  T: In Principles of Education, we looked at all the standards in the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics. Today, we are going to focus on some of the standards that can be more challenging to interpret. We will look at one standard from each section and identify an example of adhering to the standard, as well as an example of violating the standard.  T: Can I have a volunteer read the standard on the slide?  T: (Display slide with Standard 1.5: The educator shall neither accept nor offer gratuities, gifts, or favors that impair professional judgment or that are used to obtain special advantage. This standard shall not restrict the acceptance of gifts or tokens offered and accepted openly from students, parents of students, or other persons or organizations in recognition or appreciation of service.)  S: (Read standard from slide.)  T: An example of following this standard would be when a teacher accepts small gifts from their students around the holiday season. An example of not following this standard would when a teacher accepts a large gift from a parent after the parent has explained how important it is for the student to do well in the teacher’s class.  S: (Add examples to chart in Student Guide.)  T: Can I have a volunteer read the second standard on the slide?  T: (Display slide with Standard 2.4: The educator shall not interfere with a colleague's exercise of political, professional, or citizenship rights and responsibilities.)  S: (Read standard from slide.)  T: An example of following this standard would be when a teacher respects the political beliefs of a colleague even though they do not agree with them. An example of not following this standard would be when a teacher asks a colleague to remove a political bumper sticker from their car because they think the candidate does not support public schools.  S: (Add examples to chart in Student Guide.)  T: Can I have a volunteer read the third standard from the slide?  T: (Display slide with Standard 3.1: The educator shall not reveal confidential information concerning students unless disclosure serves lawful professional purposes or is required by law.)  S: (Read standard from slide.)  T:  An example of following this standard would be when a teacher refuses to share information about a student’s living situation with the parent of another student in the class who asks them. An example of not following this standard would be when a teacher uses their access to a district-level dataset to look up discipline data about students on a community soccer team and shares it with the team’s coach.  S: (Add examples to chart in Student Guide.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Discerning Unprofessional and Unethical Behavior T: One of the challenging aspects of ethics for educators is that there are some behaviors that are not ethical, but they are still unprofessional and should be avoided.  T: We will explore this distinction by considering some simple examples. After we do that, we’ll consider unethical and unprofessional behavior in two scenarios.  T: Our first example is a teacher who needs to fill out some forms to complete their taxes. They print the forms on their school printer because their printer at home is out of ink. Is this behavior unethical? Does it violate the Texas Educators’ Code of Conduct?  S: No.  T: Is it unprofessional and something that should be avoided?  S: Yes. Teachers should only use equipment at school for work related to their job.  T: Add the answer and explanation to your Student Guide.  S: (Add answer and explanation to Student Guide.)  T: Our second example is a teacher who has a file cabinet in their classroom with a broken lock. They keep forgetting to notify the school facilities team about the issue, and they keep copies of their students’ IEPs in the cabinet. Is this behavior unethical? Does it violate the Texas Educators’ Code of Conduct?  S: No.  T: Is it unprofessional and something that should be avoided?  S: Yes. That type of confidential information should be locked up so that it cannot be accessed by others.  T: Add the answer and explanation to your Student Guide.  S: (Add answer and explanation to Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Practice 2: Discerning Unprofessional and Unethical Behavior through Scenarios T: In your Student Guide, you will see two scenarios that are more complex than the examples we just considered. Half of you will read Scenario A and respond, and the other half of the class will read Scenario B and respond.  T: (Divide class in half. Assign Scenario A to one half and Scenario B to the second half.)  T: Take four minutes to read and respond to the questions for your scenario.  T: (Set four-minute timer.)  S: (Read assigned scenario and respond to questions in Student Guide.)  T: Can I have a volunteer read Scenario A?  S: (Reads Scenario A.)  T: The first possibility is that Mr. A. and Ms. B volunteer for the campaign of the person running against Mr. F. Please raise your hand if you think Mr. A. and Ms. B are acting unethically?  S: (Raise hands.)  T: Please raise your hand if you think Mr. A. and Ms. B. are acting unprofessionally?  S: (Raise hands.)  Can I have a volunteer share if this is unethical, unprofessional, or acceptable, and why?  T: Please raise your hand if you think Mr. A. and Ms. B. are acting acceptably?  T: Can I have a volunteer who thinks these teachers are behaving unethically explain their vote?  S: They are making it hard er for Mr. F. to win, and that’s unethical.  T: Can I have a volunteer who thinks these teachers are behaving unprofessionally explain their vote?  S: They’re allowed to campaign for the other candidate, but the teachers at the school all need to work together, and they’re making it harder to have a good relationship with Mr. F.  T: Can I have a volunteer who thinks these teachers are behaving acceptably explain their vote?  S: This is acceptable because it doesn’t prevent Mr. F. from running for office, and Mr. A. and Ms. B. are allowed to vote however they’d like.  T: The second possibility is that Mr. A. and Ms. B take down Mr. F.’s campaign signs. Can I have a volunteer share if this is unethical, unprofessional, or acceptable, and why?  S: This is unethical because it violates the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics. One of the standards states that “The educator shall not interfere with a colleague's exercise of political, professional, or citizenship rights and responsibilities.”  T: Can I have a volunteer share Scenario B?  S: (Reads Scenario B.)  T: The first possibility is that Mr. S. looks at the school’s records and calls the parent to let her know that the school has already called, so she does not need to make a report. Can I have a volunteer share if this is unethical, unprofessional, or acceptable, and why?  S: This is unethical because Mr. S. is disclosing confidential information about a student. The other parent is not someone who is authorized to have this information.  T: The second possibility is that Mr. S. says that he has not noticed any of these things about the student. He tells the parent that it’s probably not a big deal. Can I have a volunteer share if this is unethical, unprofessional, or acceptable, and why?  S: Mr. S. has not noticed anything concerning about the student’s appearance or behavior, so he doesn’t have to report anything himself. However, if the other parent is concerned, he should support that parent with sharing their concerns with the appropriate authorities. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: Who created the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics and can make changes to it?  S: The state legislature.  T: What does the Texas Educators’ Code of Ethics do?  S: It outlines an educator’s responsibilities to students and provides standards by which to judge ethical and professional conduct. | Student Guide |
