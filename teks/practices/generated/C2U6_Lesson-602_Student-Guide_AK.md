Sequencing a Unit
#### Key Vocabulary

Define the key term below.

Example



Nonexample



Practice 1: Example
Read the Grade 1 Module 1 Survival Unit Overview. With a partner, respond to the questions below to help explain how the unit is sequenced to build a 1st grade student’s understanding and mastery of how pond plants and animals survive in their environments.
How do these skills build on each other?
The concepts build on one another by first introducing students to the body parts of plants and animals and how they use those parts to help them survive. Students then apply that knowledge to help them understand how those body parts and external features help them respond to their environment in order to survive. Students then apply that to build and understanding of how those body parts and senses help them protect their offspring.







#### Practice 2: Nonexample

Read the nonexample Grade 1 Survival Unit Overview. With a partner, respond to the questions below to help explain why the sequence of this unit isn’t structured in a way that is likely going to help build students’ understanding of the standard.






Explain why the sequence of this unit isn’t structured in a way that is likely to help build students’ understanding of the standard.

The topics in this unit do not fully address the standard, which is to demonstrate an understanding of how the structures of plants help them survive and grow in their environment. Students grow seeds and examine seeds to determine their parts. Students look at the inside of the seed to help them understand that a need plant starts inside the seed. Students also conduct experiments to test the different environments plants can survive in. These lessons and activities focus only on the parts of plants and the environment plants grow best in and do not help students build an understanding of how the different plant parts help it grow and survive in their environments. The activities are surface level and do not get to the level of rigor required by the standard.


| Sequencing | Organizing concepts in an order that starts simple and builds in complexity |
| --- | --- |


| Unit | Learning Outcomes | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Demonstrate awareness of environmental sounds and words in sentences | Count the number of sounds heard or the number of words heard in a sentence |
| 2 | Orally blend syllables and two- and three-phonemes (sounds) to form words | Cup-cake = cupcake /k/ - /i/ -/s/ = kiss |
| 3 | Orally blend sounds to form words | /m/ - /a/ - /t/ = mat |
| 4 | Orally blend and segment sounds in words | Dot = /d/ - /o/ - /t/ |
| 5 | Discriminate between vowel sounds in words | /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/, /o/ |
| 6 | Orally blend sounds to form words | /c/ - /a/ - /t/ = cat |
| 7 | Orally segment words with consonant clusters | clip = /c/ - /l/ - /i/ - /p/ |
| 8 | Review vowel sounds, digraphs, and other sounds and spellings | /sh/, /ch/, /wh/ |
| 9 | Orally blend two-syllable words | /b/ - /e/ - /t/ - /er/ = better |
| 10 | Orally segment two-syllable words | Cupcake = /c/ - /u/ - /p/ - /c/ - /a/ - /k/ |


| Unit | Learning Outcomes | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Identify the beginning sound in a word | The first sound in moon is /m/ |
| 2 | Blend sounds to form words | /m/ - /a/ - /t/ = mat |
| 3 | Blend onsets and rimes | /c/ - /at/ = cat |
| 4 | Blend and segment sounds in words | Dot = /d/ - /o/ - /t/ |
| 5 | Blend sounds to form words | /c/ - /a/ - /t/ = cat |
| 6 | Identify the /th/ sound in words | /th/ - /i/ - /n/ |
| 7 | Identify the /sh/ sound in words | /sh/ - /i/ - /p/ |
| 8 | Identify the /ch/ sound in words | /ch/ - /i/ - /n/ |
| 9 | Phoneme segmentation and deletion | Lap = /l/ - /a/ - /p/ Lap without /l/ is ap |
| 10 | Identify the middle sound in a word | The middle sound in bat is /a/ |
| 11 | Identify the ending sound in a word | The ending sound in top is /p/ |
