- How did Kerri intentionally “see the room”?

Practice 2: Plan & Deliver

Plan a specific, concrete, and observable direction for a common scenario in the classroom (morning routine, moving into group work, group discussions, packing up, transitioning to a new activity, etc.).

Draft Directions:








In rounds, each group member will practice delivering their directions utilizing the Radar technique. While each person presents, the group members will observe and provide feedback using the Feedback Rubric provided.

Each round will focus on the following:

- Round 1: Practice delivering the specific, concrete, observable directions you planned.
- Round 2: Practice delivering your directions while scanning.
- Round 3: Deliver your directions, move to Pastore’s Perch, and scan from there.
