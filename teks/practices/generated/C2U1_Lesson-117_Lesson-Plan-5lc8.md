| Rationale/ Summary | Investment in classroom systems is worthwhile so students know how to set themselves up for academic success with minimal teacher intervention. It is also important that you ensure classroom systems operate at a level of excellence sufficient to serve the learning needs of the classroom.  In this lesson, students will learn the essential components of the Do It Again technique and how it can be used as a tool to establish and maintain strong systems, routines, and class culture.    This is the first of three lessons on the Do It Again technique. In this lesson, students will learn about the technique, see it in action, and analyze video clips of teachers using the strategy to determine if they followed the essential components of the technique and suggest ways the teacher could improve on their use of the Do It Again technique. | Investment in classroom systems is worthwhile so students know how to set themselves up for academic success with minimal teacher intervention.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Read the following scenario. Determine how Mrs. M could use the Do It Again technique to set a standard of excellence.   Students in Mrs. M’s class are working in groups to discuss how the environment impacts plant growth. One routine that has been established in her classroom is the “1, 2, 3, Eyes on me” technique. When Mrs. M says this phrase, students are to immediately stop what they are doing, put their materials down, and at look at the teacher.  Mrs. M is now ready for students to come back together for a group discussion, so she says “1, 2, 3, eyes on me!” Most of the students immediately stop what they are doing and look at Mrs. M, but there are still a handful of students who are still putting their pencils down and slowing turning to look at the teacher.  How should Mrs. M proceed? See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Read the following scenario.

|  | Prior to beginning the lesson, ensure you can access the video: Do It Again and Do It Again: Denarius Frazier |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  As you watch the video “Do It Again,” take note on what each teacher is doing as well as what the students are doing. What do you notice the different classes have in common? | Student Guide Do It Again |
| 15 mins | Notes: Do It Again T: What stood out most to you when watching Do It Again?  S: Answers will vary.  T: We’re also going to watch a short clip of another teacher, Denarius Frazier. Watch how Mr. Frazier relays his expectations for the students while keeping them engaged in the task. How does Mr. Frazier communicate his high standards to the class? Please write down your thoughts in your Student Guide.  S: (Watch video and take notes in Student Guide.) T: T: How did Mr. Frazier communicate his high standards to the class? S: He sets the expectation for a quick transition to whole group learning by having students immediately re-do their first sub-par transition. T: Right. when there is an established system or a particular way something is supposed to be done, and students aren’t meeting the mark, doing it again and doing it right or better is the most powerful response.   T: (Display quote on PowerPoint.) T:  Take a look at this quote from Texas Teach Like a Champion Online: “Pausing students’ execution of a new system as soon as they miss the mark and giving them the chance to do it again, better, sets the standard for quality in the class community. Do It Again is one of the most powerful tools in your toolkit for establishing and maintaining strong systems and routines, and, by extension, class culture.” T: Why do you think it is important that students’ behavior is corrected and a Do It Again strategy is used right away? S: Answers will vary.	 T: There are three key essentials to utilizing Do It Again strategies. (Display on PowerPoint) T: Who can read the first key essential for me? S: Emotional Constancy: Manage your tone and body language to keep the Do It Again neutral or positive. A smile reassures your class: mistakes are part of learning, and you are fulfilling your commitment to always help students be their best selves.   T: Thank you. Why do you think it is important that your body language is either neutral or positive?  S: So, students don’t think they’re in trouble because they are being corrected.  T: Who can read the second key essential for me?  S: Economy of Language: Use as few words as possible to lead the class through the Do It Again so their focus stays on the content and your Do It Again doesn’t turn into a lecture.  T: Why is it important to not lecture when asking students to Do It Again? S: Answers will vary, but may include: so students don’t feel like they are in trouble, so students don’t lose interest/stop paying attention, so that time is not wasted on non-academic instruction. T: Who can read the last key essential for me? S: Cut It Short: Pause students as close as possible to the moment when you see the class make a mistake. We know all people, regardless of age, learn best when they get feedback as close to the point of error as possible. Cut It Short helps students better internalize the Do It Again feedback and saves time for instruction. It also enables you to keep kids invested in wanting to achieve a standard of excellence rather than feeling like Do It Again is a drawn-out consequence.  T: Why is it important that a behavior is addressed immediately, instead of at the end of the class or a later time? S: Because the students would have the chance to practice and could understand why they needed to do it differently the first time, which could allow for learning rather than a feeling of punishment. T: You want to consider what you say to students when using Do It Again, as the language and tone you use can convey a lot. Here are some possible prompts you can use to promote Do It Again in a positive way:  “I still think we can do this better.  Let’s give it one more shot!”  “Oooh, Let’s line up again and prove why we’re the best reading group in the school.” “That was good, but we want great!” “In this class, we’re going to strive to do everything world class; let’s see if we can use more expression when we read” T: Turn and talk to a partner and come up with two prompts you would add to this list.  S: (Turn and talk to a partner.)  T: Who would like to share?  S: (Share out, answers will vary.) | Student Guide Do It Again: Denarius Frazier |
| 15 mins | Video Analysis: Do It Again We are going to re-watch the Do It Again video we watched during the bellringer. In your Student Guide, find the section titled Video Analysis: Do It Again.  S: (Turn in their Student Guide to Video Analysis: Do It Again.)  T: First, we are going to watch through the video, and I want you to review the rubric as it plays. You do not have to mark anything on the rubric yet, just think about the grading criteria for each category.   T: (Plays video.)  S: (Watch video.) T: This time when I play the video, I want you to use the rubric to assess how well the teachers meet the rubric criteria. Please note there are three teacher rubrics available, so you do not have to make all your comments on one page. T: (Plays video.) S: (Assess teachers based on rubric.) | Student Guide PowerPoint Do It Again |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: What were your thoughts about how the teachers scored on the rubric? S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide |
