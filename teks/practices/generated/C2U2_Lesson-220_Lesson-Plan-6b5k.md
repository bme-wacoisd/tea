|  | Prior to beginning this lesson, ensure you can access the following videos:  Video: Nonverbal Interventions: Julia Worrell Video: Nonverbal Interventions: Doug Lemov & Nicole Willey Video: Nonverbal Interventions: Ashley Hinton Video: Nonverbal Interventions: Nicole Willey |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Has a teacher or coach ever publicly corrected yours or a classmate’s behavior? How did it feel? What was the result? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Intro to Least Invasive Interventions   T: How could a public correction of behavior disrupt the learning environment?   S: It can make students feel embarrassed or unsafe in the classroom. It can make students feel unappreciated by the teacher.   T: Today, we are going to talk about “least invasive intervention,” a strategy for making student redirection and intervention nearly invisible so that teaching and learning is not disrupted.  There are three techniques for least invasive intervention:  nonverbal intervention, verbal intervention, and private individual correction. Today we’ll review nonverbal interventions.   Define nonverbal interventions. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Intro to Nonverbal Interventions  T: Let’s “step into the classroom” to observe and learn about nonverbal intervention. Show students “Nonverbal Interventions: Juliana Worrell.”)  S: (Take notes on the 2.20 Student Guide.) T: Turn and talk with a neighbor to share what you noticed and any questions you had.  S: (Turn and talk) T: What did you notice?  S:  A student speaking, students listening, gestures, hand motions, students responding together  T: How might the flow of discussion have changed if Juliana had redirected the students verbally?   S:  The teacher would have had to stop teaching, which may cause students to lose engagement and focus.  T: What is nonverbal intervention? What does it look like in the classroom?  S: Gestures, silently modeling a desired behavior, facial expressions, eye contact, etc. that reinforce expectations, manage classroom transitions, and keep group discussions productive  T: To implement this deliberate practice, you will likely spend time gradually transitioning from verbal to nonverbal interventions. Let’s learn more about that process.   T: (Show students the interview with Doug Lemov and Nicole Willey).   S: (Take notes on the 2.20 Student Guide.) | Student Guide Video: Nonverbal Interventions: Julia Worrell Video: Nonverbal Interventions: Doug Lemov & Nicole Willey |
| 10 mins | Notes on Five Keys for Effective Nonverbals T: Let’s review five keys for effective nonverbals. (Review the five keys using the 2.20 PPT).  S: (Share and record evidence of each from the Juliana Worrell video.)  T: (Chart student responses on the board or PPT.)  S: (Record evidence in the 2.20 Student Guide.)   T: (Use PPT to review Five Keys for Effective Nonverbals.)  S: (Take notes in student guide.)  Five Keys for Effective Nonverbals:  Reinforce Expectations You Already Taught: As Nicole explained, Nonverbals are useful for reinforcing expectations you've already taught. If you try to use a Nonverbal to "teach" an expectation, you're likely to confuse students.  T:  What evidence shows that Juliana is reinforcing expectations that have already been taught?   S: Juliana has clearly taught students to track the speaker and reinforces that with nonverbal cues.  Redirect Early: Address students’ off-task behavior sooner, rather than later. This allows you to step in with a smaller redirection. Once a behavior is “major,” it is very hard to correct it nonverbally  T:  What evidence shows that Juliana is reinforcing expectations that have already been taught?   S: Juliana immediately redirects students when she notices them not meeting the expectation.  Deliver Nonverbals While Teaching: Continue instruction per usual, circulating throughout the room as you teach. This ensures that the task of learning continues for the class while you redirect behavior as needed  T: What evidence shows that Juliana delivers nonverbals while teaching?   S: Juliana scans while she is teaching and while a student is sharing her ideas and redirects behaviors as needed.  Communicate the Solution: Show students exactly what they need to do to adjust their behavior as opposed to focusing on what they should stop doing. Make clear gestures (e.g., reminding a student to take notes by pretending to write) and model where appropriate (e.g., communicating to a student to sit up by modeling strong posture yourself)  T: What evidence shows that Juliana communicates the solution?   S: Juliana uses nonverbal cues to communicate to students what they need to do.  Model Emotional Constancy: Nonverbals can carry an emotional valence, whether positive, neutral, or negative. A harsh, hands-down gesture delivered with a scowl amplifies rather than minimizes invasiveness. Strive to deliver your Nonverbal Interventions neutrally or with a touch of warmth.  T: What evidence shows that Juliana models emotional constancy?  S: Juliana’s body language is neutral as she redirects students. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Nonverbals in Action  T: Let’s watch a couple more examples. For these videos, I am going to assign you one key to focus on. While you watch each video, focus on evidence of your one key. I’ll pause the video after each scene to give you time to record your evidence.   T: (Break students into groups and assign each group a key to focus on. Ask group members to compare notes and then share out. )  S: (Take notes on their assigned key as they watch in the Student Guide.)   T: Now that you have your own notes, it’s time to compare with other students who were looking for the same key. In groups, share and compare your evidence to become experts of your key. Be prepared to share with the rest of the class.   S: (Work with their small groups to compare answers and prepare to share with the class).   T: Now that you have become experts on your key, choose a spokesperson to share your evidence with the class.   S: (Choose a spokesperson who will review evidence of their key from the two videos. Spokesperson shares with the class.)  Reinforce Expectations You Already Taught: It is evident that students have already been taught the expectation Redirect Early: The teacher redirects immediately Deliver Nonverbals While Teaching: gesture to tell students to put their hands down Communicate the Solution: The gestures are clear and tell the student exactly what he needs to do to improve his behavior Model Emotional Constancy: Maintains neutral body language; provides a smile even after multiple reminders | Student Guide Video: Nonverbal Interventions: Ashley Hinton Video: Nonverbal Interventions: Nicole Willey |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Why is it important to use nonverbal interventions to redirect student behavior?   S: Nonverbals do not disrupt teaching. Nonverbals  T: How do nonverbals impact classroom culture?  S: It helps to create a safe classroom and trust the teacher. |  |
