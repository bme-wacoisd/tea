Return to your KWL chart. Complete the final column with information about self-regulation you learned today.

Which of the following scenarios provides a better example of a one-on-one conference? Explain your answer.
Scenario A: Mr. K is using student conferences before a math test. While students engage in practice activities related to the content that will be on the test, Mr. K calls each student to the front of the room for individual conferences. He begins the conference by sharing the student’s quiz grades from the four quizzes given throughout the unit. He asks the student to point out their lowest quiz grade and then reviews the topics assessed by the quiz. He asks the student two write down the list of topics and then asks them what they will need to study before the test.

Scenario B: Ms. S is using student conferences before a math test. The day before students engage in practice activities related to the content that will be on the test, Ms. S provides students with a portfolio of their work throughout the unit and a checklist that guides them through the work to determine their strengths and weaknesses. Then, as students put the final touches on a unit project, she calls them up one at a time to discuss their reflections. She begins by asking each student how they are feeling about the test and then asks them to share their strengths and weaknesses. She ends the conference by showing the students the practice activities that will be available the next day and asks them to identify one or two that will be most important for them to engage in.

Based on your experience in the role play, what is one goal you have for improving your facilitation of one-on-one conferences?
