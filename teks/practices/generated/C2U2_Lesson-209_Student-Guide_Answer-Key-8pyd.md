Notes on Talk Aspirations

List the elements of an effective Talk Aspiration

- Motivate students: Communicate your belief in students’ potential and connect the daily work of the classroom with their goals and dreams.
- Maintains Economy of Language: Using fewer words helps students to focus on what they need to do to meet expectations and brings everyone back to the lesson as quickly as possible.
- Maintains Emotional Constancy: Again, it’s wise to use a neutral tone when delivering redirections of any kind.

Note the different ways Talk Aspirations can be used.



In order for a teacher to effectively use Talk Aspirations, what must they do first?

Answers will vary. Students may reference the importance of getting to know your students and talking with students about their goals and aspirations. When teachers acknowledge students’ potential and connect the work directly to students’ goals, students feel known. When students feel known, they are inspired to meet their potential.



Practice 1: Analyze Challenge in action

How does Mr. Burmeister motivate his students using Talk Aspirations?
He asks, “Who is ready for Broadway?” and says, “Places!” indicating their desire to be actors on Broadway.


How have your teachers motivated you?
Answers will vary.



Practice 2: Upgrade the nonexample
Work with a partner to revise the following statement from Texas TLAC Online to make it a Talk Aspirations statement. Remember to use Economy of Language when developing your statement.

Scenario: The teacher poses a challenging question to the class. A student responds correctly, but the response lacks precision and academic vocabulary. The teacher says, “Close. Try that again.”

Revised Statement:
Possible responses:
"The ideas are there. Now how would a biologist say it?"
"Great start. How can you make it stronger by adding the precise, technical term?"


Practice 3: Delivering the Challenge
Partner up with someone new. With your new partner, role play the scenario. Each student will play the “teacher” role while the other partner is the “student” role.

The person in the “teacher” role will use the Talk Aspiration statement they drafted earlier to motivate and inspire the student. The person in the student role will use the feedback rubric below to provide specific feedback to their partner on the alignment to the success criteria.
