### Bellringer

- Revisit the scenario from yesterday’s bellringer.
- Ms. C. just finished a lesson on insects and assigns students a brochure to show what they learned. The brochure must include information and pictures. One student in the class struggles with writing and although she learned a great deal about insects and can elaborately explain her learning, her teacher thinks she has a lack of knowledge and didn’t master the task because she struggled to create her brochure.
- How can the teacher use one-on-one conferencing to support this student?

### Exit Ticket

- Read the following scenario and determine how Mr. K could more effectively engage in one-on-one conferences with students by using the guidelines for executive functions.
- Mr. K. is using student conferences before a math test. While students engage in practice activities related to the content that will be on the test, Mr. K. calls each student to the front of the room for individual conferences. He begins the conference by sharing the student’s quiz grades from the four quizzes given throughout the unit. He asks the student to point out their lowest quiz grade and then reviews the topics assessed by the quiz. He asks the student two write down the list of topics and then asks them what they will need to study before the test.
