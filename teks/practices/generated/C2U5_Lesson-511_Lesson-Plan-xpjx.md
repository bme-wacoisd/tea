| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | A colleague has shared his draft lesson plans for an upcoming English unit. He has asked you to provide him some feedback on his summative assessment as you have been working with him to develop more aligned assessments.  Below are details that he has included regarding his end of unit assessment.  Unit Objectives to be assessed: Write clearly and effectively to convey complex ideas. Cite strong evidence to support analysis. Determine the theme and central idea. Demonstrate the understanding of English grammar. Demonstrate understanding of English conventions.  Assessment Description:  Students will be given a test with multiple choice questions to complete based upon details from a recent text they read called Things Fall Apart. The questions will measure knowledge about key characters in the text, theme, and central idea. There will be a matching section of the text where students will match quotes from the text to the characters who said those quotes. They will provide a brief description of why those quotes were important.  Based on the characteristics for effective assessments, what feedback would you recommend to your colleague?  See 5.11 Exit Ticket-Answer Key for exemplar response. | A colleague has shared his draft lesson plans for an upcoming English unit.

| 4 mins | Bellringer Debrief: T: Let’s review our bellringer together.  Think back to our previous lessons. What is summative assessment? S: Summative assessment happens at the end of a learning sequence and helps determine the extent to which students have met the learning objectives. T: What is formative assessment? How is it different from summative assessment? S: Formative assessment happens during the learning and helps a teacher know what steps to take next to help students to learn the content. It is more of an assessment of a point in time rather than a summary of knowledge. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Notes-Types & Characteristics of Effective Summative Assessments T: In today’s lesson, we will focus on different types of summative assessments. As we look at these different summative assessment types it is important to remember that all assessments should align to the characteristics of effective assessment. Let’s see what you remember.  Can anyone think of a characteristic of effective assessment? You can share one characteristic and then call on a classmate to share another. S: (Shares one of the following answers then calls on the next student to answer.) Aligned with learning target(s) and measures appropriate level of rigor based on learning target. Fair and transparent Practical Cognitively engaging T: Think about your experience. What types of summative assessments have your teachers given you to measure your proficiency of learning targets at the end of learning? S: (Answers will vary but may include): Projects Quizzes/Tests Essays  Performance Tasks &Portfolio Assessment T: Why do you think your teacher selected that type of summative assessment for your unit? S: (Answers may vary, but could include anything about easier to grade, aligning to type of test/assessment given at end of course, more engaging, etc.) T:  Teachers have a lot of decisions to make when it comes to summative assessment. There are many ways to evaluate student learning at the end of a unit of study and each type of assessment serves a different purpose for a teacher in terms of the information it measures and how it is applied as a summative assessment. T: There are 6 different types of summative assessments that we will take a deeper look at today. As I share information about them, please take notes in your student guide. Quiz:  Shorter summative assessment containing simple, content-focused questions. They are good for assessing information, concepts, or a discrete skill. Typically, they have selected response (multiple choice/matching/etc.) or short answer formats where questions have a single, best answer. They are easy and quick to grade. Tests: Like quizzes but longer more comprehensive in evaluating standards. A test tends to be a bit more formal, including a combination of selected response, short answer and longer answer formats (longer essays). They may take longer to grade than a quiz but can provide a more complete picture of learning due to the larger number of questions. Essays: Open-ended prompts or questions that require the student to think critically, not just recall knowledge. There is not a single best answer as they involve analysis, synthesis, or evaluation. They typically require a student to defend or explain the answer given. Grading takes longer and requires more judgement by the teacher based on a set of success criteria. Projects: Alternative way to assess students’ learning. Projects can take a lot of forms, but generally provide an opportunity for students to display and apply their learning to produce a creative product. Projects typically take longer to complete, sometimes several days. Grading takes longer and requires more judgement by the teacher based on a set of success criteria. Students have a greater opportunity to personalize the task and often find the experience more authentic and engaging. Performance tasks: Like projects, performance tasks allow students to display their learning in an alternative way. Performance tasks require students to “perform or demonstrate” the skills and competencies. Performance tasks include a complex challenge or problem that is like those faced by adults, making them more authentic. They assess a higher level of thinking, often requiring analysis and evaluation to solve the problem. They can be short-term or long-term and allow students to personalize the task leading to greater student engagement.  Portfolio Assessment: Collection of student products that demonstrate learning against a set of learning objectives. Due to the number of student artifacts included in the portfolio across the learning process, it is easier to assess progress against the learning targets. It also can be a more complete picture of student learning because there are multiple pictures of performance rather than a one-time assessment. Portfolios often also include a student reflection of their work and progress. Portfolios take longer for students to put together and to grade as teachers need to assess multiple tasks and it is tougher to assign a formal grade against success criteria. | Student Guide PPT |
| 7 mins | Practice 1: Identifying and Assessing Effective Summative Assessment T:  Now let’s look at an example of how standards within an instructional unit might be assessed in a variety of ways.  We will identify the type of assessment and determine if the assessment example meets the success criteria for effective assessment. Finally, we will make determinations about which is the best assessment to use based on the scenario for the teacher. T: Read the scenario provided under Practice 1 on your 5.11 Student Guide.  S: (Read practice 1 scenario.)  T: (Model think aloud with example.) As I approach this example, I begin by examining the standards as skills that need to be assessed. Then I look at the constraints the teacher mentions and what is important to consider about the assessment. What stands out to you about this information from the scenario?  S: (Answers may vary but could include): Standards include not only counting and representing the numbers but also explaining and justifying thinking and making connections to real-life or other content. Teacher sees this an important foundational concept and has 2 days to utilize for assessment.  T: Yes, this is an important foundational concept and having 2 days allows more time to implement the assessment. Based on the higher level of rigor expected (not just recall or explain, but apply, justify, and connect) a project or performance task might be a great fit. Let’s look at her options.  T: Look at the first option. Based on the description, what type of assessment do you think that describes & why?  S: That describes a test because there are multiple types of questions, and the questions sound like they only have one right answer.  T: Yes, this is a test. Based upon the characteristics of effective assessments, do you think this is an example or non-example of effective assessment?  S: This is a non-example because it doesn’t align to all the standards/skills outlined by the teacher. It doesn’t allow students to explain the representations or their ideas.  Also, no opportunity to connect math knowledge to other ideas.  T: What about the second description. What type of assessment is it?  S: It sounds like either a project or a performance task.  T: It is a performance task. Sometimes a project and performance task sound similar, but performance tasks generally have a scenario where students are provided a task that is like one that adults might have, like designing an episode of a children’s show. It also requires students to “perform or demonstrate” the skills. This is not always a requirement for a project.  T: Is it an example of effective assessment? Why or why not?  S: Yes, this is effective assessment. It aligns to all instructional objectives with content & rigor. Criteria is clearly outlined, and it is practical because the teacher has allotted 2 days for the assessment.  T: What about the third description? What type of assessment is that?  S: It sounds more like a project. It doesn’t necessarily give a scenario for why students are performing or demonstrating the skills.  T: Is it an example or non-example of effective assessment?  S: It is a non-example. While this is practical and the criteria is clearly outlined, this project does not align to the rigor of the instructional objectives.  T: Great. So, based upon the descriptions provided and considering the requirements and outlined learning objectives, which of the following descriptions should the teacher choose?  S: The teacher should choose the performance task. It is the only one that aligns to the standards with both rigor and content. The criteria for the task are clearly outlined and the scenario provides a purpose and authenticity for students which they will find engaging. The teacher has allotted 2 days so that is a reasonable time and it make sense to spend the time and try to find an engaging task because the concept is foundational for students in their math learning. T: Yes, in this case it might be best to choose the performance task not just because it is the one that is aligned but because it is important for the teacher to engage students deeply in this foundational skill. The scenario gives the students a purpose for their work and the teacher has the time to be able to accomplish this assessment.  T: But, as was mentioned before, there are lots of ways to assess student learning. No matter the assessment, we need to make sure that our assessment is effective. Let’s look at the two non-examples in this scenario and think about how we might adjust, so they fit the characteristics of effective assessment. | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | Practice 2: Revising Effective Summative Assessment T: Locate practice 2 on your student guide. You will see the descriptions of the two non-examples from our practice 1 scenario. Based upon what you know about characteristics, what adjustments or improvements might you make to each non-example to make it a good example of effective assessment? S:  In the first description, the questions were not aligned to the learning objectives, especially with the level of rigor. The teacher might consider adding a section where students are asked to explain their thinking where they draw pictures of the numbers. They also could ask a question where students provide an example of where students use representation of numbers in their other classes or outside of school.  T: Yes, it is important that we not only include the content but help students to explain and justify their reasoning. Also, adding the question where students provide an example of representation of numbers in other classes and outside of school allows them to connect their learning to other disciplines and experiences. What about description 2? How could we improve that one to make it an effective assessment? S: This one is missing the explanation of thinking and connection to outside life and disciplines as well. The teacher could add a component of the project where students are asked to present their flipbook, explaining their thinking to the audience. Also, they could ask the students to utilize real life examples to connect counting to other disciplines or outside of school. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Practice 3: Analyzing, Evaluating, and Revising Summative Assessments  T:  Locate Practice 3 on your Student Guide.   S: (Find Practice 3 on student guide)  T: Now is your chance to apply your learning about the characteristics of effective summative assessments. With a partner, you will look at the examples provided of summative assessments. First identify the type of summative assessment and then describe and identify if it is an example of effective summative assessment. If it is, explain why. If it isn’t, explain how it could be adjusted to meet the criteria for effective assessments.   S: (Work with a partner to complete student practice for 10 minutes.)  T:  Now that you had a chance to think with a partner, find another group of two and share your answers. Be sure to write down additional ideas you get from the other group on your student guide. | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | Debrief T: Today we focused on different types of summative assessment. What are some of the types of summative assessment that we discussed?  S: (Answers may vary but should include): Quiz, test, project, performance task, essay, and portfolio  T: How do we make decisions about the types of summative assessment to use?  S: We consider the standards that are covered, the level of rigor required as well as the time constraints and purpose/why we want to engage students in the assessment. Some assessments like quizzes or tests are easier to grade and take less time but are only good to measure facts, recall or explain level questions. Projects, performance tasks and essays can better assess critical thinking but are tougher to grade and require clear success criteria to be communicated to students.  T: How do portfolio assessments differ from the other summative assessment types we discussed today?  S: Portfolio assessments include several student work artifacts collected over time, whereas the other assessment types generally collect data at the end. Portfolios are better at showing progress or growth against learning objectives. | Student Guide PPT |
