Directions: Review the scenario below that was shared earlier in the lesson.
Scenario: Students are solving math problems. You’ve asked them to show their work, but you notice that a few students are skipping right to jotting the solution.

Think back to the Assume the Best statement you crafted. Compare your words to an example provided from Texas TLAC Online: "Pause. A few of us are forgetting to show our work. Remember: Show your work in addition to writing the solution. Back to it!"

- How does your statement compare to the one provided?

- How did the example statement above attribute behavior to positive intent?



- How did the example statement above tell students exactly what they should do?



- How did the example statement above maintain economy of language?
