- From the list below, circle effective strategies that a teacher might use to build relationships with their students.



- What affect could it have on a student who spent several years in a classroom with a teacher who did not build strong relationships? Consider the student’s academic progress as well as their attitude about school.




Practice 1: Scenario Analysis (Examples and Non-Examples)
Review the scenarios below. For each, identify what the teacher is doing well to build trusting relationships and what the teacher might do better.

Scenario 1: Complete with the class.

Scenarios 2 and 3: Complete with a partner.

Practice 2: Role Play
Review the scenario below. In your group, provide each group member an opportunity to respond to the scenario using different strategies. After each round, discuss strategies used. Use the graphic organizer below to guide your discussion and record key ideas.
Scenario: Mr. Rodriguez is engaged in facilitating a whole class discussion. During the discussion, two students disagree with one another and begin to argue. The argument escalates. How should Mr. Rodriguez handle the situation and diffuse the argument while building trusting relationships with the students who are arguing?



| Learns all students’ names in the first week of school | “Jokes around” with students using sarcastic comments about their work | Breaks down difficult problems but allows students to solve them. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frequently raises voice and gets visibly upset with students who are not listening. | Wears clothes that kids might think are cool | Greets students every day with a calm voice and a smile |
| Allows students who are struggling to do easier work | Follows through on a promise to have lunch with the students on Wednesdays | Allows student to play during class because they probably need a break. |


| Scenario 1: Middle school teachers have 10 minutes with their students in between lunch and the next class. Mrs. Sherron uses the time to read a book aloud to students. She insists that students do not talk during this time but allows them to draw or put their heads down to rest. |

| Scenario 2: Students are working in groups when the teacher notices a verbal argument between two students. The students seem to be arguing over a note on their table. One student is clearly agitated and is raising her voice. Mrs. Baker moves within close proximity of the students, she speaks in a low voice to remind the students of the rules for working with groups. She removes the note but does not read it. She asks the students to students to retrieve the note after class when she has a chance to talk with them. |

| Scenario 3: During independent work time, a student realizes he needs a new pencil. He approaches the teacher’s desk, opens a drawer, and goes through her materials until he finds a pencil. The teacher asks, “Ben, what do you think you’re doing?” He responds that he needs a pencil. The teacher says, “Okay, just remember to bring your own next time.” |
