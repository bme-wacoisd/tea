Think about how you tie your shoelaces. You likely learned to tie your shoes long ago and probably do it often without giving it a second thought. But how did you learn it?  Based on what you anticipate about how learning works, use the chart in your student guide to create a list of some of the steps that you would take to help a child to learn to tie their shoelaces.
