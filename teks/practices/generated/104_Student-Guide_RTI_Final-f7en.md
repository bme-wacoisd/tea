Notes: Three Key Characteristics of Effective Instructions
When should a teacher provide effective directions?


Practice 1: Example and Non-Example of Effective Directions
Directions #1:
Think about whether you agree or disagree with the author of the editorial we read. Get into groups to discuss your answer and how you will support it. Gather feedback from your group. Write a letter to the editor in which you agree or disagree with the author.

Are these directions specific?			Yes			No

Are these directions sequential?			Yes			No

Are these directions observable?		Yes			No

Directions #2:
In your Student Guide, write down whether you agree or disagree with the author of the editorial we read, including at least three arguments that support your opinion. When you are ready to get feedback from your peers, silently walk to the back of the room. At the back of the room, stand next to one or more of your peers. When four people are standing together, move to the side of the room for discussion.
Each group should identify a timekeeper. Each student takes three minutes to explain their position and supporting arguments. The other three students each have one minute to provide feedback. The author takes notes on the feedback in the space provided in the Student Guide. Complete this feedback process until all group members have shared.
When your group has completed its work, return to your seat. Using the feedback you gathered, write a three-paragraph letter to the editor in which you agree or disagree with the editorial.

Are these directions specific?			Yes			No

Are these directions sequential?			Yes			No

Are these directions observable?		Yes			No
