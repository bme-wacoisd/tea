### Characteristics of Quality Rubrics

- List of specific criteria: Students and raters will clearly know the expectations for the task based on the key criteria identified.  These are the standards by which the task will be rated.
- Focused on the most important content: the rubric should measure the key skills and knowledge aligned to the instructional objective.
- Clearly defined and measurable levels of performance: these represent the level to which the task meets expectations.  Typically, a quality rubric will describe 3-5 levels of performance. Each level of performance will be specifically described.  The more specificity used, the easier it will be to rate, it will be rated more consistently, and students will clearly understand the rating.
- Reliable: It must be descriptive enough so that various raters will identify the same or similar score.
