Lesson 8.07: Multiple Means of Representation and Options for Perception
Name:
Date:
Bellringer: A second-grade science teacher uses pictures and music to introduce new vocabulary related to the learning objective. She reads each word aloud and has the students practice their pronunciation. During the lesson, students watch a video, read or listen to an article on their iPads, and play a game that matches pictures, vocabulary, and real-world scenarios related to the objective.
How might this approach to introducing new vocabulary benefit students?
