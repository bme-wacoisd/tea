| Rationale/ Summary | Positive reinforcement is an important tool to build student morale and motivation. Positive reinforcement communicates to students that they’ve been successful and should continue to do more of that behavior. It is essential that teachers make positive reinforcement strategic to avoid communicating compliance as excellence and to reinforce actions, not traits.  In this lesson, students will learn the keys to successful positive reinforcement, analyze examples of positive reinforcement in action, and practice creating and delivering positive reinforcement statements for a set of observable directions. | Positive reinforcement is an important tool to build student morale and motivation.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Read each example statement and decide if it is an example of positive reinforcement or a nonexample. Explain your reasoning. Choose one nonexample and revise the statement to include positive reinforcement. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Read each example statement and decide if it is an example of positive reinforcement or a nonexample. Explain your reasoning.

|  | Prior to beginning this lesson, ensure you can access the following videos:  Precise Praise #2: Ms. Lewis Precise Praise #2: Mr. Javsicas |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Read the statements below and determine whether or not you believe each to be true. Place a check in the appropriate column and be prepared to compare answers with a partner. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Intro to Positive Reinforcement T: (Provide time for students to compare their answers with a partner using a routine of your choice – turn and talk, think-pair-share, stand up – hands up – pair up, etc.)  T: To what extent did you and your partner agree?   S: Answers will vary  T: What points of disagreement – if any – did you discuss?  S: Answers will vary  T: Were you able to come to agreement?  S: answers will vary  T: Today’s lesson will focus on positive reinforcement. By the end of the lesson, you and your partner will be able to come to agreement on all of the statements.  T: Positive reinforcement is the feedback that follows a desired behavior and increases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated. Positive reinforcement builds morale and motivation. Positive reinforcement may include: praise and nonverbal communication (e.g., smile, nod, thumbs up) social attention (e.g., a conversation, special time with the teacher or a peer) tangibles such as stickers activities or privileges such as playing a game secondary positive reinforcements (such as checkmarks, tokens or money) for students to use toward a reward.  T: (Share the following information about positive reinforcement – precise praise – from Teach Like a Champion 2.0 via PPT. Provide an example and non-example of each as indicated in the PPT. Ask students to create additional examples and nonexamples for each success criteria.)  T: Now that we have had opportunity to review examples and non-examples, I am going to give you time to create additional examples and nonexamples for each of the success criteria.   Keys to positive reinforcement – Examples and Nonexamples Reinforce actions, not traits - Positive reinforcement is about praising an action that you want to encourage. Offer objective-aligned praise –Align positive reinforcement to the learning objectives.  Differentiate Acknowledgement from Praise: Use acknowledgement when a student meets expectations. Use praise when a student exceeds expectations.  Example: “Sarah is ready” is an example of acknowledgement, whereas “Great job getting your materials out for our next activity so quickly, Sarah” is praise. Modulate and vary your delivery: Positive reinforcement is most effective when it is genuine and memorable. Vary the setting (public or private) and the volume.  Private – often sounds genuine; communicates that what the teacher is going to say is very important; shows that not all private conversations need to be about individual correction. Public – Intended to be overhead by others; encourages others to emulate that behavior or action. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Analyze Positive Reinforcement in Action T: Now, let’s see what this looks like in action. As we watch this video, take note of how the teacher uses positive reinforcement to acknowledge and praise student actions. Record your observations on the 2.19 Student Guide.  T: (Show “Precise Praise 2” - Ms. Lewis.)  S: (Take note of how the teacher used positive reinforcement to acknowledge and praise student actions. Record observations on the 2.19 Student Guide.)  T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. If you are in an odd row, turn to the person behind you and compare your answers.  S: (Compare their answers with a partner.)   T: We are going to watch another example now. As you watch, take note of how the teacher used positive reinforcement to acknowledge and praise student actions. Look specifically for what the teacher does similarly to and different than the teacher in the first video.  T: (Show “Precise Praise #2” - Mr. Javsicas.)  S: (Record observations on the 2.19 Student Guide. Respond to the following question in the 2.19 Student Guide: What was different about the ways the two teachers delivered their positive reinforcement?)  T: What did you notice about how the two teachers delivered their positive reinforcement?   S: the first teacher provided public feedback about students’ actions; the second teacher provided private feedback to a student | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Plan and Deliver Positive Reinforcement T: We’ve seen a couple of teachers implement positive reinforcement. Now it’s your turn. You are going to work with a partner to write 3 positive reinforcement scripts. Let’s do one together first. Imagine you have asked students to continue working on their paragraphs to include strong transitions. What might you say to students to reinforce their work?   S: Answers will vary.   T: (Provide the following examples after eliciting student responses:  “I see Jada has used a transition in her second paragraph.” “Mike used a transition, but he went back to make it show the contrast between the paragraphs more clearly. Great job, Mike!”)  S: (Work with a partner to write 3 scripts that a teacher might use to reinforce the behaviors and/or actions they want students to demonstrate for each direction. Students will record their scripts in the 2.19 Student Guide.  Pencils in the groove and eyes on me. I should see all fingers on the word, "the." You may begin reading and taking notes.  T: Now that you have written scripts, let’s practice.   S: (Switch partners to practice delivering their positive reinforcement statements.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Why is it important to provide positive reinforcement?  S:  It identifies actions that students can replicate to demonstrate success and excellence; acknowledges and praises students for meeting and exceeding expectations which builds confidence and motivation.  T: How does positive reinforcement create an effective learning environment?   S: It helps students understand how to succeed again the next time and communicates/models to others what success looks like.  T: How does positive reinforcement build strong relationships with students?   S: Positive reinforcement builds morale and motivation; students feel valued and in turn want to do the right thing. | Student Guide |
