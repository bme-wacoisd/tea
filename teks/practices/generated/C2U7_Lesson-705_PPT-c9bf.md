## Slide 5

### Key Practices for Effective Modeling

- Small, learnable steps:  Small, manageable chunks prevent cognitive overload.
- Visual demonstration:  demonstrate each step as students watch.
- Verbal explanation:  explain each step as you demonstrate them.  Provide a rationale for why that step is important and key details for that step.  Keep explanations short and direct.
- Connect the steps.  This is important to understand the sequence to the process as well as looking for ways to connect to prior learning.
- Pause & check for student understanding along the way.  Allow opportunities for students to ask questions and get clarification. Re-model steps as necessary.
