### Lesson 7.07: Collaborative Learning | Part I

Name:
Date:

Bellringer: Describe a time when you were asked to work as a part of a group to complete a project. What are the characteristics of effective and ineffective group work?

Notes: Introduction to Collaborative Learning


Practice 1: Lesson Analysis


Practice 2: Planning for Collaborative Group Work
Based on the scenarios below, plan for effective facilitation of group work. Each partner will take the lead on planning for one scenario while the other partner acts as a “Rally Coach” to show support.
Scenario 1
Ms. Westbrook’s ELA class is engaging in book circle discussions. Each group will choose a different book to read. After finishing each chapter, the small group will have a group discussion. During the discussion, they will discuss new vocabulary they encountered in the chapter. They will also discuss how the characters have developed in the chapter, how the author has used literary devices in the chapter, and how the conflict is deepening or resolving. Ms. Westbrook wants to be sure all students participate in the discussion and every student


Scenario 2
Students in Mr. Morrison’s 1st grade science class are designing protective coverings to protect scientists’ arms and legs when they are exploring the plants at the edge of a pond. Students will imagine a solution, test, and record information about various materials, and come to a final solution about their protective covering. At the end of the project, they will present their process and solution to the rest of the class.

| Ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary to accomplish the task. |  |  |
| Vary the size and membership of the group according to the activity’s purpose and individual learning goals. Groups are most effective when they range in size from 3-5 participants. |  |  |
| Use structures such as group roles, norms, and explicit time keeping, ensuring that students share the responsibility and ownership of outcomes. |  |  |
| Provide opportunities for regular feedback on group processes as well as student/group self-evaluation. |  |  |
| Be clear about expectations and instructions for the task. |  |  |

| Ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary to accomplish the task. | What about the task requires collaboration? |
| Vary the size and membership of the group according to the activity’s purpose and individual learning goals. Groups are most effective when they range in size from 3-5 participants. | What size group would you use and why?   How will you use individual learning goals to help you determine membership of each group? |
| Use structures such as group roles, norms, and explicit time keeping to ensure that students share the responsibility and ownership of outcomes. | What group roles might you use?   What norms might you include?   How would you break the task into timed chunks? |
| Provide opportunities for regular feedback on group processes as well as student/group self-evaluation. | How will you provide feedback to the group?   How will you plan for reflection based on group processes? |
