| Rationale/ Summary | Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes and mental skills necessary for a learner to focus, remember, and manage multiple tasks successfully. It is the brains way of filtering out distractions, prioritizing tasks, setting and reaching goals, and controlling one’s impulses. In order to support a learner’s executive capacity. A teacher must teach learners how to set long-term goals, plan effective strategies to reach their goals, monitoring their progress toward the goals, and modify the strategies used to reach those goals as needed. In this lesson, students will define and explain the importance of executive functions. Students will use one-on-one conferences to practice the guidelines for executive functions and identify strategies to support students in developing executive functions for a scenario. | Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes and mental skills necessary for a learner to focus, remember, and manage multiple tasks successfully.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Read the following scenario and determine how Mr. K could more effectively engage in one-on-one conferences with students by using the guidelines for executive functions.  Mr. K. is using student conferences before a math test. While students engage in practice activities related to the content that will be on the test, Mr. K. calls each student to the front of the room for individual conferences. He begins the conference by sharing the student’s quiz grades from the four quizzes given throughout the unit. He asks the student to point out their lowest quiz grade and then reviews the topics assessed by the quiz. He asks the student two write down the list of topics and then asks them what they will need to study before the test.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Revisit the scenario from yesterday’s bellringer.  Ms. C. just finished a lesson on insects and assigns students a brochure to show what they learned. The brochure must include information and pictures. One student in the class struggles with writing and although she learned a great deal about insects and can elaborately explain her learning, her teacher thinks she has a lack of knowledge and didn’t master the task because she struggled to create her brochure.  How can the teacher use one-on-one conferencing to support this student? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | T: How can the teacher use one-on-one conferencing to support this student?  S: The teacher could use the one-on-one conference to have the student self-reflect on their learning using a rubric for insects. Through this, the teacher could see that the student knows more than she is able to demonstrate and plan for an alternative way the student could demonstrate their understanding. T: Why are one-on-one conferences important? S: They focus on the students’ emotions about learning, provide scaffolded opportunity for student reflection on their own learning progress. focus on the student’s strengths and opportunities for growth, include space for goal setting, and end with next steps. |  |
| 8 mins | Intro to Executive Functions   T: Today, we are going to learn about the next guideline for multiple means of action and expression – executive functions.   T: (Share via PPT.)  T: Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes and mental skills necessary for a learner to focus, remember, and manage multiple tasks successfully. It is the brains way of filtering out distractions, prioritizing tasks, setting and reaching goals, and controlling one’s impulses. Executive functioning is dependent on three types of brain functions: working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control. (Center on the Development Child, Harvard University).    S: (Take notes in student guide.)  T: Let’s watch this short video on the importance of developing executive functions to support skills for life and learning.  T: How do executive functions impact one’s ability to be a part of a civil society?  S: Executive functions allow you to work effectively with others, overcome distractions, manage multiple demands.   T: Yes - This guideline focuses on teaching a learner how to prioritize and resist impulsive behaviors to set long-term goals, plan effective strategies to reach their goals, monitor their progress toward the goals, and modify the strategies used to reach those goals as needed. | Student Guide PPT Video Source: https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/inbrief-executive-function-skills-for-life-and-learning/ |
| 10 mins | Guidelines for Executive Functions  T: Let’s look at the guidelines and strategies for providing options for executive functions in a classroom.   T: (Share via PPT and walk students through each guideline.)  S: (Take notes in student guide.)  Adapted from CAST (2018). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.2. Retrieved from http://udlguidelines.cast.org  T: Why is it important for a teacher to support students in setting appropriate goals to guide their work?  S: It provides students with the skills and strategies they need to manage challenging tasks that can then be applied to other contexts.    T: What is the value in learners developing a plan to reach their goals?  S: This helps students become problem-solvers to develop and plan reasonable strategies to reach their goals.   T: How can prompts such as “stop and think” and “show and explain your work” help support students with planning and strategy development?  S: It forces students to stop and think about their course of action. By asking students to explain their work, students have to think about the different steps they took and the strategies they used to get to their end goal.   T: What might be the result if students don’t develop a reasonable plan for reaching their goals?  S: They might waste time trying things that don’t lead to success.  T: How does the use of graphic organizers, checklists, and notetaking guides help avoid cognitive overload?  S: They help students focus on the most important content and provides a structure for the task. It also provides a tool that students can refer to later.    T: Why might be the impact if students do not receive timely and specific feedback?  S: Learning cannot change or improve because students do not know what to do differently.  T: Why is it important to provide multiple opportunities for students to self-assess and self-reflect on their learning?  S: It allows students to monitor their own progress and use that information to guide their own effort and practice. |  |
| 2 mins | One-on-One Conferences to Support Executive Functions  T: In a previous lesson in this unit, you learned about goal setting. What do you remember about setting a personal goal?  S: The goal must be aligned to the class standards that are being taught in the course and the goal needs to be realistic.  T: We learned in our overview of this guideline, students often need support to learn how to set goals, how to develop a plan for their goal, how to organize information, and how to monitor progress and learn from their mistakes. What is one strategy teachers can use to support students in this process?  S: One-on-one student conferences.  T: What are one-on-one student conferences?  S: A conversation between a teacher and an individual student focused on the student’s learning progress.  T: In a previous lesson, you practiced one-on-one conferences.   T: What do you remember about the elements of a one-on-one conference?  S: One-on-one conferences: Are brief. Include attention to the students’ emotions about learning. Provide scaffolded opportunity for student reflection on their own learning progress. Focus on the student’s strengths and opportunities for growth. Include goal-setting. End with next steps  T: In our last lesson about one-on-one conferences, we focused on self-regulation – the ability to set learning goals, monitor progress towards goals, monitor motivation for learning, and regulate emotions. In this lesson, we are going to talk more about how to help a student develop a plan for achieving their goals. |  |
| 8 mins | Model Practice Scenario  T: Before you try, I am going to model a conference for you. Who will play the role of the student?   S: (Raise hands to volunteer.)  T: (Select one volunteer. Invite volunteer to the front of the room to model a one-on-one conference. Provide the volunteer with the model script.)  T: Please find the conference scenario on your student guide and follow along with me while I read the scenario for the modeled conference. (Read the scenario out loud.)  S: (Find the scenario and read along while the teacher reads out loud.)  T: What questions do you have about the scenario?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: (Respond to any questions asked.) Before we begin the conference, take a minute to review the student’s self-reflection.   T: Now, we are going to model the conference for you. As you watch, take notes on evidence of the guidelines for executive functions using the graphic organizer in your student guide. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice Scenario with Partner  T: Now, it’s your turn to role play one-on-one student conferences with a partner.   T: You will use the same writing conference scenario, but your checklist and reflection will look different than Student A’s. You will each have 4 minutes as the teacher to role play a one-on-one conference with a student. Are there any questions before we begin?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: (Respond to any questions.) I am going to set a timer for 4 minutes for the first role play. After the 4 minutes is up, you will have a minute to debrief and discuss how the teacher used the guidelines for executive functions. The first role play may begin now. (Set timer for 4 minutes.)  S: (Engage in role play until 4 minutes is up.)  T: Take a minute to debrief the role play. How did the teacher address the guidelines for executive functions? As you debrief the role play, the teacher should take notes in their own student guide about what they did well and what they could improve.  S: (Debrief. Teacher records reflections in student guide.)  T: I am going to set a time for the next role play. You have 4 minutes.   S: (Engage in role play until 4 minutes is up.)  T: Take a minute to debrief the role play. How did the teacher address the guidelines for executive functions? As you debrief the role play, the teacher should take notes in their own student guide about what they did well and what they could improve.  S: (Debrief. Teacher records reflections in student guide.) | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: How did you feel as a student during the role plays?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: How did the one-on-one conference with a teacher build your executive functions as a student?  S: The teacher helped me develop a reasonable plan for reading my goal, provided tools to help guide my thinking, and allowed me to self-assess my own progress. |  |
