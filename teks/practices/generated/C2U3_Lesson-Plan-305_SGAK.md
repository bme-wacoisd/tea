### Lesson 3.05: Introduction to Asset-Based Approaches

For each scenario, consider two ways that a teacher could respond. Place a check mark next to the best response and explain your choice underneath the scenario.
Scenario 1:
A new student has enrolled in Ms. B.’s fifth grade class. She noticed that he was speaking Spanish with his parents when they dropped him off at school this morning, and he isn’t speaking to many of his new classmates.
Option A: Ms. B. administers a reading assessment to determine the new student’s reading level. He can read above his grade level, so she makes sure that he has challenging books to read during silent reading.

Option B: Since Ms. B is sure that her new student doesn’t speak English well, she skips the reading assessment. She gives him a third-grade book to read during silent reading.
Explain your choice:
In Option B, Ms. B assumed that her student didn’t know English because she saw him speaking to his parents in Spanish and he’s he has been quiet in class. She doesn’t know whether he can understand English. In Option A, she gives him an assessment so that she can determine how to best meet his academic needs.
Scenario 2:
Mr. W. teaches high school science. The TEKS for his course states that students should complete lab experiments. Mr. W. knows that his students haven’t had much experience in science labs because the district doesn’t have a lot of science equipment.
Option A: Mr. W thinks it will be easier for his students to watch videos of the lab experiments rather than complete them on their own.

Mr. W spends time understanding what his students know about working in the lab and provides instruction on basic lab skills before introducing his students to the experiments.
Explain your choice:
In Option A, Mr. W tries to make it easy on his students instead of challenging them to do the lab experiments. This isn’t helping any of his students prepare for future science courses they may need to take. He should hold higher expectations for them, like he does in Option B, and help them develop the skills they need to be successful.



Introduction to Asset- and Deficit-Based Teaching
What are these types of teaching?

How does a teacher act when using one of these types of teaching?

Practice: Identifying Asset-Based and Deficit-Based Teaching
In Scenario 2 from the Bellringer:
- Option A represents deficit-based teaching.
- Option B represents asset-based teaching.


|  | Asset-Based Teaching | Approach to teaching that focuses on what students can do rather than what they cannot do. |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Deficit-Based Teaching | Approach to teaching that focuses on what students cannot do rather than what they can do. |


| Teacher Behavior | Type of Teaching |
| --- | --- |
| The teacher sets high expectations and helps students meet them. | Asset-Based |
| The teacher assumes that students can’t, or don’t want to, be challenged to learn more. | Deficit-Based |
| The teacher assumes that students don’t bring their own unique strengths to school. | Deficit-Based |
| The teacher speaks about their belief that all students can learn challenging skills and knowledge when they receive appropriate support. | Asset-Based |
| When working with struggling students, the teacher identifies the unique strengths that can help them succeed. | Asset-Based |
| The teacher sets low expectations and provides students with easy assignments. | Deficit-Based |
| The teacher provides opportunities for students to show the knowledge and skills they have from being members of their communities. | Asset-Based |
| The teacher assumes that students who have individualized education program (IEP) plans will not be able to succeed. | Deficit-Based |


| Example | Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mr. M. has several students in his math class who are learning English as a second language. The upcoming geometry unit includes new and challenging academic vocabulary. He uses sentence frames, annotation, pictures, and class discussion so that students become familiar with the new vocabulary as they solve grade-level word problems. | Asset-Based | Mr. M. found a way to support these students with developing their English skills while building on their math knowledge and skills. |
| Three high school English teachers are planning their writing activities for students for the next unit. Since the students are seniors, one suggests that they write a college application essay as an assignment. The other two teachers disagree with the idea; they note that most of the students in this school do not need any type of education after high school. They decide not to give the assignment. | Deficit-Based | The two English teachers are using a stereotype about students in their school to decide what assignments to give. They do not acknowledge that students may be interested in pursuing a variety of postsecondary options that involve additional education. |
| Ms. N.’s students will take the Texas Success Initiative Assessment (TSIA) this year. She knows the assessment includes a writing section, but her students tell her that writing is too hard for them. She knows many of them have struggled academically, so she doesn’t assign any writing assignments. She doesn’t want to have to give them bad grades when she knows writing is a challenge for them. | Deficit-Based | Because Ms. N. knows her students have struggled before, and think writing is hard, she assumes she will need to give them bad grades for writing assignments. In making this decision, Ms. N. is focusing on what she perceives as her students’ weaknesses rather than challenging them to become stronger writers. |
| Mr. Y.’s elementary school students are preparing short presentations on important holidays. Rather than assigning holidays using the school calendar, he allows students to select their own, including holidays not celebrated in the United States. | Asset-Based | By giving his students the option to research holidays other than those celebrated in the United States, Mr. Y. is allowing them to develop further knowledge that they already have. |
| During a small group discussion, a student incorrectly states that 27 is a prime number. The teacher responds by asking the following questions:  What makes a number a prime number? Does 27 have other factors besides 1 and 27? Why isn’t 27 a prime number?  The student corrects their response, and the discussion moves on. | Asset-Based | The teacher pushed the student to fix their mistake and explain why it was incorrect. This practice holds the student to a high standard. |
