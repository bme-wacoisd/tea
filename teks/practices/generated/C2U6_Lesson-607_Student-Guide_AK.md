### Lesson 6.07: Scaffolding a Lesson | Intro to Gradual Release

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Compare each parent’s approach to teaching their child how to ride a bike.
- Parent #1: When teaching her son to ride a bike, the parent sat on the bike to demonstrate how to ride. She provided her son with training wheels to start then gradually raised the training wheels. Once she felt her son was ready, the mom took off the training wheels and instead used her hand to guide her son as she walked beside him. Once the boy felt steady, the mom removed her guiding hand and let her son take off on his own.

- Parent #2: When teaching his son to ride a bike, the parent explained how to ride the bike. He explained to his son how to sit on the seat, steady himself, and use the peddles. Then, he put his son on the bike and gave him a push.

Which approach likely led to more success and why?
Parent #1’s approach likely led to more success because she provided more support to help him succeed. She showed the child how to ride the bike, gave him training wheels until he felt steady enough riding. After she removed the training wheels, she used her hand to steady her son then allowed him to go off on his own.

Intro to Gradual Release of Responsibility
Write the definition for each term below as they are discussed in the lesson.


#### Practice #1

With a partner, examine Lesson 1 from Grade 1 Knowledge 1 Fables and Stories Unit -  pages 12-19 to identify the I do, we do, and you do sections of the lesson. Identify what the teacher actions are and what the student actions are in each section. Then, determine how this structure helped build students’ understanding within the lesson.


How did the structure of the lesson help build students’ understanding?

The structure of this lesson helped build students understanding by gradually shifting the cognitive load from the teacher to the student. It allows learners to take in, process, and learn information in small increments and in a logical order and provided space for learners to build on their prior knowledge. The scaffolded approach helped build students understanding of the characteristics of fables, such as characters, setting, plot, and moral. It provided essential background information to help students learn about Aesop fables and how they came to be. Students then listened to a fable and identified the characters, setting, plot, and moral. Students had to consider what elements of the story made it fictional and what the moral of the fable was. Students learned about the word ‘startled’. The teacher described a situation and students had to determine if the person would be startled or not startled. Students discussed the elements of drama, such as characters and a setting. Then students acted out the main events of the fable. To follow up, students answered the following question by writing yes or no on their index card: Is the moral of the story if you often lie, people will still always believe what you tell them?
