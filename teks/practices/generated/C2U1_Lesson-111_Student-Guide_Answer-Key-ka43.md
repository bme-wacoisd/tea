Notes: Keys to Effective Practice of Routines


When all four keys are used:
Teachers anticipate student confusion, and students practice strategically simplified steps that prevent the confusion from taking hold. As a result, they are more likely to succeed in completing the routine.






Practice: Reading Guide
How did Ms. Brown’s double-plan help her to break the practice into chunks?
It helped her divide the routine into two parts: “Stand Up” and “Switch.” She also thought about what she would do during each step and what her students would do during each step.
How did Ms. Brown’s plan for practice address her anticipated pitfalls?
She created a list of pitfalls for each step and then planned out how she would help students practice avoiding each one.


| What does Ms. Brown do to help her students practice a routine for how they transition while reading? |
| --- |
| Responses may vary but may include: She gave clear observable directions. She modeled what she wanted them to do. She broke up the routine into smaller pieces to explain, model, and practice it. She celebrated success. She highlighted students who were doing the right thing. She made corrections. |


| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Model and Describe | The teacher shows the students what to do and describes how to do it. |
| Pre-empt Pitfalls | Pre-empting something means taking action to prevent it from happening. Applied to the classroom, it means a teacher thinks ahead of time about what will be difficult for students and plans for students to practice those parts. |
| Isolate the Step | It’s helpful when students practice the routine in small steps at first instead of trying to practice a multi-step routine all at once. |
| Scan and Give Feedback | A teacher is scanning the classroom when they examine the room point-by-point by moving the eyes to observe all students. As they scan, they can give feedback. If they highlight examples of students doing the routine correctly, they can reinforce the routine, which is an action that strengthens the response. |
