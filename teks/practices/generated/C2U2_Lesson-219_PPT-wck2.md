### Elements of Positive Reinforcement


| Key Element | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Reinforce actions, not traits | Praise actions (what a student does), not traits (personal character) to identify actions that students can and should replicate. |
| Offer objective-aligned praise | align positive reinforcement to the learning objectives |
| Differentiate Acknowledgement from Praise | Acknowledgement is what you use when a student meets your expectation. Praise is what you use when a student exceeds your expectations. |
| Modulate and vary your delivery | vary the setting (public or private) and the volume |
