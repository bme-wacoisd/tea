### Considerations for Determining Peer Feedback Strategy

- 6
- Age group of students
- Amount of time required to provide feedback
- Type of feedback (small part of work vs whole piece of work)
- How much feedback to give (feedback from many students or just one or two)
- What stage of the work is the strategy best used? (Before draft is complete vs. after a draft is complete)
- Scaffolds to support effective feedback

## Slide 9

### Scenario 1

- Mr. Olivera is working with his 2nd grade students on their opinion writing.  Students have been asked to write a short paragraph describing whether they prefer dogs or cats as a pet.  Each student has completed an opinion paragraph supporting their claim with at least three details and the paragraph contains 3-5 sentences.  The students also included a picture with their work that illustrates some part of their paragraph.  Now that students have completed their task, he wants the students to receive some feedback on their work from peers.  He only has about 30 minutes to dedicate to the process in his classroom but feels it is important for the students to hear from at least a few peers.

### Scenario 2

- The students in Mrs. Greaves 8th grade social studies class have been learning about the New England Colonies and the foundations of representative government in the United States.  In groups of three, the students were tasked with creating a front page of a newspaper from colonial times that highlighted articles about life as a colonist as well as key events during that period.  Students worked to create their newspaper page on a large poster, creating a creative name and including images that enhance and support the information shared in their articles.  Mrs. Greaves wants the groups to get feedback from everyone in the class on their work but only has about a half of class period to dedicate to the feedback process.

## Slide 11

### Scenario 3

- Mr. Johannsson is teaching a level II art class at the local high school.  His students are exploring artistic styles from a variety of historical periods and cultures.  He has tasked his students to choose a time period and culture and create an original work of art that demonstrates the specific characteristics of representative artwork from that time and culture.  The students have completed a draft plan for the piece of work outlining some of the materials and key characteristics to include.  They have also completed a sketch of the potential work.  Mr. Johannsson thought it would be helpful for the students to get some feedback from peers before beginning work on the final piece. Because this piece is an important part of the student’s grade for the quarter, he is willing to dedicate a full 90-minute class as for feedback to allow students the opportunities to think about revisions before they start working on the final piece the following week.

## Slide 12

### Exit Ticket

- Students in Mrs. Blanchard’s middle school science class have worked on developing science experiments to investigate density.  The students designed an experiment to determine the density of different objects, conducted the experiment to collect data and then created a poster to present the experiment, data, and findings to their classmates.  The students have just completed their posters and Mrs. Blanchard wants all the students to have a chance to explore and provide feedback on each of the experiment posters.  She has dedicated about twenty minutes of class time to allow for students to provide feedback.
