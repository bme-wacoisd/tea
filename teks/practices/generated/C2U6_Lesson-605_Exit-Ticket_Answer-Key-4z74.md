Date:
Read the standard below and circle the objectives that are high-quality objectives based on the SMART components.
TEKS 1.3B	Use objects and pictorial models to solve word problems involving joining, separating, and comparing sets within 20 and unknowns as any one of the terms in the problem such as 2 + 4 = [ ]; 3 + [ ] = 7; and 5 = [ ] – 3
- Student will solve add to with result unknown and put together with result unknown math stories by drawing, writing equations, and making statements of the solution.
- Students will solve word problems.
- Students will solve add to with change unknown math stories using 5-group cards.

What makes the objectives you circled strong objectives?
The objectives circled are specific, measurable, attainable, related to the standard, and can be achieved within a lesson opposed to the other objective listed that was broad. It did not tell the type of word problems students would solve or how they would solve the word problems.

How might the lack of high-quality objectives impact student learning?
Without strong objectives, the lesson may be disjointed and not focus on the most important content Students may not know what they are learning or what they will be assessed on. The lesson components, such as the instruction, practice, and assessments may not align to the objective. This will lead to a lesson that is not high-quality and doesn’t smoothly lead students to mastery of the standard.
