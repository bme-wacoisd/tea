Student Guide – Answer Key
Lesson 8.12: Multiple Means of Action & Expression | Expression & Communication
Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Ms. C. just finished a lesson on insects and assigns students a brochure to show what they learned. The brochure must include information and pictures. One student in the class struggles with writing and although she learned a great deal about insects and can elaborately explain her learning, her teacher thinks she has a lack of knowledge and didn’t master the task because she struggled to create her brochure. What are some other ways the teacher might find out what this student knows about insects?

Student response will vary but should reflect an understanding that the student should have alternative ways to share their learning.

Intro to Expression & Communication

Practice 1 - Scenario Analysis
Consider to two scenarios below to determine which is the best example of applying expression and communication.
Example 1: Mrs. D. spent the week teaching her students about frogs and the life cycle of a frog. To demonstrate their understanding, she gives students a worksheet where they must label the steps of the life cycle and write at least 3 sentences about a frog. She then provides students with materials to make a model of the life cycle of a frog.
Example 2: Mr. H. also spent the week teaching his students about frogs and the life cycle of a frog. To demonstrate their understanding, Mr. Harper gives his students a choice board where they must choose how they want to demonstrate their learning about frogs and their life cycle. Some of the choices include making a video, creating a visual representation, writing a paragraph, podcast series, etc. Mr. H. provides students with a rubric that indicates the key components of a frog life cycle that students must demonstrate in their products.
Example 2 was the best example because Mr. Harper gave his students a choice board that allowed them to choose the way they showed what they learned. For example, students could write a paragraph or create a video which provided opportunities for students to communicate using multiple forms of media. Mr. Harper also gave students a rubric so they would know the expectations for the assignment, which supported their independent learning.

Practice 2 – Demonstrate Your Understanding
Use the space below to write down key ideas and information you have learned so far about physical action and expression & communication.
Student responses will vary but should indicate any of the following:





| Expression & Communication | Expression & Communication | Expression & Communication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guideline | Examples | Nonexamples |
| Provide opportunities for students to communicate using multiple forms of media. | Ask students to solve problems using a variety of strategies Allow options for students to communicate through text, speech, drawing, music, comics, dance, video, etc. Offer physical manipulatives, such as blocks, base-ten blocks, 3D models | Ask students to solve problems using the same strategy Require students to share their learning through writing a summary |
| Allow students to use tools that complement the learning goal | Use sentence starters or sentence strips Use spellcheckers, grammar checkers, text-to-speech software, calculators Use story webs or concept maps | Ask students to engage in a discussion without supported prompts Require all students complete a task without access to tools |
| Provide differentiated levels of support and scaffolds to support independent learning | Provide feedback that is customized to the individual learner Provide access to mentors, such as another teacher or tutor Provide models and scaffolds that can gradually be released | Give general feedback to all students on an assignment Provide the same scaffolds and support to all students |


| Physical Action | Physical Action | Physical Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guideline | Examples | Nonexamples |
| Provide alternative ways for students to interact with instructional materials and their environment | Provide flexibility with time, pacing, and range of motor action required to interact with instruction materials.  Allow students to type an essay instead of writing it by hand Provide multiple ways for students to respond, compose, or select material | Require all students to interact with instructional material at the same pace and in the same way Require all students to access content in a printed format |
| Provide access to and support with tools and assistive technologies | Teach alternate keyboard commands for mouse control Allow customized overlays for touch screens and keyboards Model the use of assistive technologies and accessibility tools | Require students with barriers to complete an easier assignment Allow assistance technologies without modeling and support |
