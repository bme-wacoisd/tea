| 3 mins | Bellringer If you had to learn how to accurately measure a liquid using a graduated cylinder, would it be easier for you to learn it by reading about it in a book or watching a video about how to do it on YouTube? Explain your rationale. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Bellringer Review T: Raise your hands if you chose to read about the new skill in a book. S: (Students raise hands.) T: Why would this be effective for you? What would need to be in the book to help you to learn this new skill? S: If the skill was explained in a step-by-step manner or included pictures or diagrams it might be effective. T: Raise your hands if you chose to watch a video on YouTube about the skill.  S: (Students raise hands.) T: What would make that effective for you? What is different about the video compared to the book that would make it better for you? S: In the video we can watch someone doing the skill while they are explaining it. It may also take less time for me to watch the video than read the book. |  |
| 5 mins | Introduction to Explicit Teaching  T: When something is made explicit, what does that mean?  S: It is clear and detailed, completely explained.  T: Yes. When things are made explicit there is little  room for confusion. When something is explicitly taught, a teacher guides students through the learning process, step by step, with clear explanations, procedures, and success criteria. They clearly show students what to do and how to do it.  T: Why do you think explicit teaching would help students to learn better?  S: Students would have a clear example of what they are supposed to do and an explanation of why it is important and how to do it successfully. They could replicate the example.  T: Modeling is a strategy that teachers use to explicitly teach new content and skills. When teachers model, they visually show students a process while describing each step with a rationale.  T: When teachers provide a strong model, they communicate to students what success looks like and what the process looks like to achieve success. Modeling communicates to students the importance of what is being taught, it decreases student errors, and it helps to build student confidence.  T: The following are key practices to include in an effective model.  Small, learnable steps: small, manageable chunks prevent cognitive overload. Visual demonstration: visually demonstrate each step as students watch.  Verbal Explanation: explain each step as you demonstrate them. Provide a rationale for why that step is important and key details for that step. Keep explanations short and direct. Connect the steps. This is important to understand the sequence to the process as well as looking for opportunities to connect to prior learning. Pause & check for student understanding:  Allow opportunities for students to ask questions and get clarification. Re-model steps, as necessary.  S: (Take notes in student guide.)  T: A model is effective when the learning is sequenced with an “I do” (teacher model), “we do” (practice together) and “you do” (practice independently). | PPT Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Example: Modeling  T: I am going to model how to introduce the sound /ee/. Please locate the example problem on your student guide under Example: Modeling.   T: As I model for you, listen carefully to identify the key practices of the modeling process we just discussed. Be sure to complete the steps on your student guide as I show them on the board.  T: The sound for today is /ee/ as in feet. We have two “I can” statements for today. Let’s read them together. “I can repeat words that have the /ee/ sound.”  (Read statement aloud to class)   S: (Read statement with class)  T: “I can recognize words that have the /ee/ sound in the middle.” (Read statement aloud to class)  S: (Reads statement with class)  T: Let’s practice the sound.  Say /ee/. Repeat it several times.  S: Student’s practice saying the sound /ee/ several times.  T: There are many words that have the /ee/ sound at the beginning, middle or end of the word.  T: Some words have the /ee/ sound at the beginning. I am going to show you the words and we are going to say them out loud together: eat, each, east, eagle.    S: Students say the words eat, each, east and eagle together guided by the teacher as a whole group.  T: Now let’s look at some words that have the /ee/ sound in the middle.  I am going to hold up the words as we say them together: peace, greet, meat, heat.  S: Students say the words peace, greet, meat and heat guided by the teacher as a whole group.  T: Now let’s look at some words that have the /ee/ sound at the end.  I am going to hold up the words as we say them together:  bee, me, key, tree.  S: Students say the words bee, me, key, tree guided by the teacher as a whole group.  T:  Do you think /ee/ is a vowel sound or a consonant sound?  S: It is a vowel sound.  T: Yes, we make the vowel sound with an open mouth and an unobstructed flow of air.  T:  Now you are going to say several words. Some of the words will have the /ee/ sound as their middle sound and some will not.   T: Close your eyes and listen carefully. I am going to say several words. When you hear a word that has an /ee/ sound in the middle, raise your hand.  T: Say the words slowly and clearly, one at a time:  Cheek, cheap, bed, meet, pin, deep, bean, hen  S: Raise hands when they hear cheek, cheap, meet, deep, bean  T: I have just modeled for you an ELA teacher would teach the oral recognition of the /ee/ sound. Think about what you have just done and heard. How did this model demonstrate the key practices of effective modeling? Take 2 minutes to write down evidence in the chart under the example on your student guide.  S: (Write down evidence of effective modeling on student guide.)  T:  Where did you notice the small, manageable steps?  S: The sound was introduced first, then they practiced saying the sound, they practiced different words with the sound, before they had to recognize words with the sound and without.  T:  Where did you notice the visual demonstration?  S: You showed pictures of the words as you said them.  T: Where did you notice the verbal explanations?  S: You explained the sound at the beginning, middle and end of the word and gave examples that we practiced. You also explained how to make a vowel sound.  T: Where did you notice how I connected the steps?  S: You connected the learning of the sound first, then practiced the sound, used words with the sound at the beginning, middle and end. Also connected to prior knowledge of consonant and vowel sounds.  T: Where did you notice I checked for understanding?  S: You asked for students to share whether it was a vowel or consonant sound. At the end of the lesson, you had us close our eyes and raise our hands when you said words with the /ee/ sound in them. |  |
| 8 mins | Non-Example: Modeling  T: Now that we have seen an example of an effective model, let’s examine a non-example.   You have been given the scenario and script for a model on how to classify animals by their physical characteristics.  T:  Locate the scenario for the non-example on your student guide under the section “Non-Example-Modeling.”  S: (Locate Non-Example-Modeling section on student guide.)  T: Take a minute to read through the scenario independently.  S: (Read scenario.)  T:  You have the chart below this non-example on your student guide that is like the one that we completed during the example of a model. As we discuss this non-example, record evidence of what makes this a non-example for each of the key practices listed.  T: Based on the scenario, what should the teacher be modeling?  S: The teacher should be helping students to remember the different categories as well as looking for each of those categories in the pictures.  T: What were some things you noticed that made this a non-example for small, learnable steps?  S: The teacher didn’t break this into parts.  She was vague in asking for characteristics, so students didn’t know what to provide as answers.  T: What were some things that you noticed that made this a non-example for visual demonstration?  S: The teacher showed the picture, but it doesn’t indicate or highlight visually the important characteristics that are noted by the student.  T: What were some things that you noticed that made this a non-example for verbal explanation?  S: The teacher didn’t explain how to identify the different characteristics of the animals.  T: What are some things that you noticed that made this a non-example for connecting to prior learning or connecting the steps?  S: The teacher didn’t connect the model to the prior learning of the students.    T: What are some things that you noticed that made this a non-example for checking for student understanding?  S: The teacher did not stop to check for understanding of the key information throughout the model. The teacher did not provide opportunities for students to ask questions.  T: Based on what we have identified, what are some suggestions we could make to change this model from a non-example to an example of the key practices of effective modeling?  S: (Answers will vary but may include many of the following)  The teacher could have showed a chart with the different characteristics across the top.  The teacher could have reviewed/questioned students about each of the characteristics before showing a picture.  When showing the picture, the teacher could have asked more specific questions about what students noticed about the different categories of characteristics.  As students identify characteristics, the teacher could point and explain how each met or didn’t meet the characteristics.   The teacher could have paused to see if student’s had questions about how the animal was classified or about the task before releasing them to work. |  |
| 15 mins | Practice: Modeling  T:  You are going to roleplay with a partner today to practice a modeling scenario. Please locate the script you will follow on your student guide under Practice: Modeling.  S: (Locate practice section.)  T: (Arrange students in groups of two.) With your partner you will practice modeling this math example. One person will serve as the teacher who will do the modeling, the other will serve as the student. With your partner, decide who will be the teacher and who will be the student.  S: (Determine partner rolls.)  T: Take 3 minutes to read through the script for the model and familiarize yourself with your role.  Take time to prepare any materials you may need. (Set timer for 3 minutes.)  S: (Read through the script for the model.)  T:  You will have 5 minutes to role play your modeling scenario. You may begin now. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S: (Role play modeling scenario)  T: With your partner, use the table below the modeling scenario to discuss and record where you experienced or saw evidence of each of the key practices for effective modeling.  S: (Discuss/record evidence of key modeling practices.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T:  How did it feel for you to practice modeling with a script? Was it easy or hard for you?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: What were some pieces of the evidence that you noticed of effective modeling in your role play practice?  S: Showed small steps by showing the 1’s first and then counting & drawing to show the 1’s. Then drew the 10. The visual demonstration was the chart with the 1’s and the 10’s, where each circle showed either a 1 or a 10, and the teacher drew the 1’s as the students counted. The teacher explained each step, counted out loud as the picture was drawn.  Connections were made when the teacher said that “1 ten is 10 times as much as 1 one.” The teacher checked for understanding by having students   explain everything to a partner and having the students repeat it at the end of the model. The teacher asked questions about units and names.  T:  As you think about the examples of modeling that we discussed today, what are the key practices that all effective models have?  S: Break the information/process into small steps, visual demonstration along with verbal explanation, the model connects the steps demonstrated and connects to prior learning and the teacher regularly checks for understanding.  T: Why is modeling an example of explicit teaching?  S: In explicit teaching, teachers show students step-by-step what to do and how to do it correctly. Modeling is the same thing. A teacher shows visually as they verbally explain how to complete a task successfully.   T: Why does explicit teaching help students learn more effectively?  S:  Explicit teaching helps students to learn because it gives them an example to replicate of what to do and how to do it successfully. |  |
