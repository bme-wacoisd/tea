- How do continuous improvement cycles benefit teachers? How do they benefit students?
Continuous improvement cycles provide teachers with opportunities to plan, act, and reflect on problems that they may want to address in their classroom. This benefits the teacher because they can consistently grow into better, more confident, and more effective educators. That benefits students because the teacher is more aware of how effective their instruction is  and how students are learning, which may help teachers in identifying areas where students are struggling to be successful.
