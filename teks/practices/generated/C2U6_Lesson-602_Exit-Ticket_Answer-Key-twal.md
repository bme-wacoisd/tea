### Lesson 6.02: Sequencing a Unit Plan

Name:
Date:
Answer the following questions.

What is sequencing as it relates to a unit plan?
The process of organizing concepts in an order that starts simple and builds in complexity.

How does sequencing a unit in a logical way help build student mastery of the standard?
- Learning builds on prior knowledge. The sequencing of lessons within a unit considers prior knowledge on a larger scope.
- Students analyze ideas and make sense of them.
- Students should learn the most complex material first so that everything else is easy.

- How does sequencing of a unit relate to the Science of Learning? Choose the BEST answer.

- Students must make meaning of the content.
- Content is presented in small increments in a sequential manner.
- If students are not paying attention, they will not be able to learn.

- Mr. Jones is starting a unit on two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes with his kindergarten students. Here is the order he plans to introduce the concepts:
- Describe two-dimensional flat shapes (square, triangle, rectangle, circle)
- Describe three-dimensional flat shapes (cone, sphere, cube, cylinder)
- Describe and compare two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes in different orientations and sizes.
Do you think this is the best approach to build student understanding? Why or why not?
Yes - he starts by introducing a simpler skill of which kindergarten students will likely have some prior knowledge. He then examines three-dimensional shapes before teaching the more complex skill of describing both two- and three- dimensional shapes in different sizes and orientation.
