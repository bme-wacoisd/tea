|  | Prior to this lesson, ensure that you can access the YouTube video “The Power of Relationships in Schools” |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think of a teacher who helped you learn difficult material. Why was this teacher effective at helping you learn something challenging? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | T: Turn to a partner seated near you. Take turns sharing your bellringer response.  S: (Share with a partner.)  T: (Call on several students to explain how a teacher helped them learn difficult material.) | Student Guide |
| 7 mins | Viewing Guide: Intro to Positive Relationships T: Today we are going to learn about specific ways a teacher can build positive relationships with students. We’ll start with a video overview about the importance of relationships. I will pause the video a couple of times so that we can discuss the viewing guide questions on your student guide.  T: (Start the video of The Power of Relationships in Schools. Pause at 1:08.) What are the benefits of building a trusting and consistent relationship with students?   S: Students create attachment to schools and the adults in schools, increased risk-taking and exploration, oxytocin is released which has positive effects on the development of the brain. (Students record responses in their student guide.)  T: (Continue the video. Pause at 2:27.) What are specific strategies that teachers use to build trusting relationships with students?   S: Morning greeting, connect with students as humans prioritize relationship-building, smile and joke, validate students, be honest, transparent, authentic self, share struggles and challenges, be vulnerable. (Students record responses in their student guide.) | Student Guide Video: The Power of Relationships in Schools |
| 7 mins | Notes, Definitions, and Examples T: Look at the table in your student guide. We are now going to dig into five ways teachers can use to develop positive relationships with students. Let’s start with building trust and rapport. (Use the PPT to define building trust and rapport and provide examples. Continue with the remaining approaches. Define and provide examples of each approach.)  S: (Add examples of each approach to their student guide.)  T: Let’s consider how we saw each of these approaches in the video. I am going to call on students to answer my questions. If you get stumped, you can “phone a friend” to suggest an answer. If you phone a friend for support, you will still need to elaborate on the answer provided by your friend.   T: How did the teachers in the video build trust and rapport with students? (Call on a student to answer.)  S: They shared their struggles and challenges, showed interest in their students.  T: How did the teachers in the video establish boundaries?   S: They were professionally dressed; they didn’t let the students just quit when they didn’t feel like doing work.  T: How did the teachers in the video display a calm demeanor?   S: When the student was struggling and not doing his work, the teacher did not yell at him.  T: How did the teachers in the video show consistency?   S: They were consistently warm with the students, smiled while also expecting them to engage in the work, they consistently greet students. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Carousel Brainstorming T: We are going to engage in a Carousel Brainstorming activity. You and your peers will brainstorm specific strategies a teacher can use for each approach. (Write each approach on a piece of chart paper and post the chart paper around the room.)  T: (Model how to add the strategy, “checking in with each student daily” to the Building Trust and Rapport chart.) Remember to list specific strategies not general ideas.  For example, “check in with each student daily” is a specific strategy while “make students feel like you care about them” is a general idea.  T: You might consider specific strategies used by the teacher you wrote about or other teachers you know. You can also agree, disagree, or add to other responses on the chart paper.   S: (Rotate to each chart paper and add examples from their experiences, observations, and from the video that belong under each category. After the first rotation, students may also respond to another group’s response.)   T: (Time and facilitate group rotations. Depending on group size, students should spend 2–3 minutes at each paper. End rotations when students return to the chart paper where they started.) Now that you are back where you started, take a minute to review the information on the chart paper and prepare to present key ideas to the class.  S: (Review information on chart paper).   T: Choose a spokesperson in your group to tell us some of the ideas on your chart paper.   S: (Choose a spokesperson and present to the class.) | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Debrief T: (Lead a discussion to debrief the activity.) Take a few minutes to reflect on and respond to the Debrief questions on your student guide.   S: (Answer questions on the student guide.)  T: (Ask for a few volunteers to share responses with the class.)  S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
