Date:
Bellringer:
Work with a partner to practice delivering the following instruction to students using the formal communication register: “Books open to page 11.”


Practice 1: Analyze Formal Register in Action
As you watch the video, take note of how the teacher uses a strong voice to communicate with students.








Practice 2: Formal Communication Register Practice Rounds

Round 1 – Speak Quietly & Slowly:
Focus on speaking quietly and slowly: “Books open to page 11.”
Watch Round 1 Video: “Establish Formal Register: Colleen Driggs”
Compare and describe Colleen’s approach to your own first round.




Practice again, focusing on speaking quietly and slowly: “Books open to page 11.”

Round 2 – Speak Quietly, Slowly, Evenly, & Lower:
In addition to speaking quietly and slowly, try speaking evenly and lower.
Watch Round 2 Video: “Establish Formal Register: Colleen Driggs”
Compare and describe Colleen’s approach to your own second round.





Practice again, applying all of the verbal characteristics of Formal Register

Round 3 – Formal Register Body Language:
For the third round, incorporate Formal Register body language into your directions. Give directions just as you did in the prior round, but this time, adopt a symmetrical posture, raise their chins, and hold still.
Watch Round 3 Video: “Establish Formal Register: Colleen Driggs”
Compare and describe Colleen’s approach to your own third round.





Practice again, speaking quietly, slowly, evenly, and lower, while adopting a symmetrical posture, raising their chin, and holding still.

Round 4 – Warm Formal
For the fourth round, try going “warm formal.”  In other words, go formal, but relax your brow and give just a hint of a smile as you speak.



Practice 3: Delivering Longer Directions
Practice standing and delivering a longer set of directions to your peers, as students, in a brief role play scenario.
“You will have five minutes to complete number one of your “You Do.”  You are working silently and solo and using your notes.  Five minutes begins now.”
