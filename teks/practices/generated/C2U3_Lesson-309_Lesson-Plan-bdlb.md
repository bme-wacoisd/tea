|  | Included here is a video of a current TX teacher. The video can be used in this lesson (or other lessons) to supplement your instruction with the voice of another Texas teacher from this program of study.  Allison Smith-A Teacher's Impact |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  When was a time a teacher contacted your parent? What did they talk about?  (If you can’t think of one, share an instance in which it may have been beneficial if a teacher had done so.)   List 4 scenarios in which a teacher may need to contact a parent. |  |
| 4 Mins | T: Can we have a volunteer to share their response to the first bellringer with the class?   S: (Students will raise hands to volunteer 2-3 responses. As they share, ask them how they felt after that communication.)  T: Let’s have some other volunteers share their responses to the second question: What are some scenarios in which a teacher may need to contact a parent or caregiver?   T: (Call on students to share. As they share, create a list of scenarios on the white board or chart paper where all students can see. Solicit additional responses if all examples are a result of negative student behavior.)  T: Why is it important that teachers and families communicate frequently?   S: Families can tell you things about your student that you do not know, provide help at home with assignments, or address challenging behaviors. It also builds trust between teachers and families to support student outcomes.   T: Parents know their students best, and they can provide context for misbehavior, strategies that have worked for students in the past, and additional academic support at home. Leveraging their expertise is critical to helping all students grow and succeed. |  |
| 7 mins | Family Communication Methods   T: Communicating with families it is a great way to  celebrate student success. get support in addressing students with academic or behavioral challenges. build relationships with families and caretakers. T: There are many ways to communicate with families. Please find the Family Communication Methods section on your Student guide. Take one minute to turn and talk with your neighbor and create a list of ways teachers can communicate with families.  S: (Turn and talk to complete graphic organizer.)   T: Let’s have a few groups share their ways to communicate with families. I’m going to create a list here, if you hear methods you did not consider, add them to your list.   T: (Call on students to share. As they share, create a list of methods on the white board or chart paper where all students can see.)  T: Not all parents and families are the same, so each may require different methods of communication. As a teacher, how might you find out what method families prefer to use to communicate?  S: Teachers can use a beginning of the year survey, reach out to the student’s previous teachers, or call to introduce themselves early in the year and find out what parents prefer.  T: Now we know the methods of communication used by teachers to engage with parents, but what should you do when you actually have that conversation with a parent? Let’s examine some success criteria for how to navigate that. Please make note of these elements in your student guide. (Review success criteria from PowerPoint.) Respect time and preferred method of contact: Consider what requires a meeting, call, email, or text. Plan ahead: Ensure you have everything in place to have a productive meeting. This can include planning questions, preparing student work examples, arranging an interpreter, as needed. Develop a relationship with the parent/caregiver Acknowledge that you both want the best for the student and seek out ways to collaborate to support their success. Demonstrate professional behavior and language. Listen actively and empathetically; avoid judgement. S: (Take notes in student guide.) | PPT, Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Practice 1: Communication Role Play  T: Find Communication Role Play section of your student guide. Let’s apply this success criteria to a specific situation. Can someone volunteer to read our scenario about Frankie?   S: (Find and read scenario)  T: We have a graphic organizer with five questions to consider as we plan for this conversation with Frankie’s parents. These mirror some of our success criteria. Let’s look at the first question together. Based on the scenario, what method of communication would you choose?  S: Phone call or home visit since Frankie doesn’t have consistent internet access at home for email.   T: How would you prepare for this parent meeting?  S: Frankie’s family does not speak English at home, so I would need to arrange for an interpreter. They do not have internet access (so no email). Have student work ready to show where he needs help.  T: Take the next three minutes and independently respond to the remaining questions.  S: (Complete the graphic organizer)  T: Can I have a volunteer to share their responses?  S: (Shares responses to questions)  T: Now that we have prepared for this conversation, you will role play with a partner. One of you will pretend to be the parent and the other will pretend to be the teacher. Each of you will have three minutes to role play as the teacher, then you will switch, and your partner will have three minutes to assume the teacher role. Any questions?  S: (Ask clarifying questions, then begin role play.) | PowerPoint, Student Guide |
| 4 min | Family Communication Tracking Logs  T: Now that we know how we want to approach communicating with families, it is important to consider how we may want to track this.  T: Once you make contact with families, it is important that you have a way to track who you have contacted, how, and the result of the conversation. Maintaining a thorough record of communication allows teachers to keep track of which families they have contacted, note preferred methods of communication, and note important information that only families can provide. Finally, if there is a recurring issue with a student, tracking all communication ensures that there is no question that a teacher sought family support in resolving the issue. Please find the sample Family Communication Tracking log on your student guide.   T: Let’s walk through each column. This teacher needed to contact Alejandro’s family and called on October 1st. They provided the reason for contact: he is now reading on grade level. It looks like they had a great conversation with Alejandro’s dad.   T: I want to draw your attention to the last column—why would it be important for a teacher to include space to log any next steps and follow up?  S: This helps teachers know what they will do differently and also what the parents are going to do to help the situation.   T: This is a critical component of family communication—working with families should be a partnership. The point of the conversation is to improve outcomes for students, so identifying what everyone can do to best support the students ensures the communication is productive. Sometimes the teacher suggests the next step, other times, like in this situation, a parent makes a request. Including next steps and follow up will make sure the conversation always leads somewhere productive. |  |
| 7 min | Practice 2: Family Communication Tracking Log  T: Now that you’ve seen a completed example, take the next 5 minutes to read about Stephanie and Bryan. Then, complete the tracking log.  S: (Complete tracking log)  T: Let’s share our responses to these two scenarios. Who can volunteer to share their tracking logs?  S: (Volunteer responses.)  T: (Provide follow up support and questions as necessary. Ensure students to include actionable items for both parent and teacher in the column “Next Steps/Follow Up.”) |  |
| 2 min | Debrief  T: In our bell ringer, some of you may have felt like teachers haven’t ever had a reason to contact your family, or that they only contact in negative situations. To wrap up our discussion today, why is it important for teachers to consistently contact families?  S: Teachers can share important updates, provide positive reinforcement, and get help from parents when students are struggling academically or behaviorally. It also builds trust that can help drive positive student outcomes. |  |
