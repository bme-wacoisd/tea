Scenario
Students in Mrs. Blanchard’s middle school science class have worked on developing science experiments to investigate density.  The students designed an experiment to determine the density of different objects, conducted the experiment to collect data and then created a poster to present the experiment, data, and findings to their classmates.  The students have just completed their posters and Mrs. Blanchard wants all the students to have a chance to explore and provide feedback on each of the experiment posters.  She has dedicated about twenty minutes of class time to allow for students to provide feedback.
