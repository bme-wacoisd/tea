#### Practice: Trust Generator Scenarios


Ms. W has a number of student athletes in her class. She always asks the students about the outcome of the games but has never attended a sporting event.

Mr. C’s science class is learning about X. Halfway through his explanation, a number of students get confused and begin asking questions. Mr. C responds by repeating what he said at the beginning of his explanation. As he repeats, he gets louder and louder and increasingly frustrated with students he thinks are not listening.

#### Ms. M has the star of the women’s basketball team in her class. She was also on school’s basketball team when she was younger and so she and her student often discuss basketball. When the student asks Ms. M at the beginning of class to attend a big game, Ms. M readily agrees and then continues a conversation with the player even after the bell rings. They talk about basketball for the first five minutes of class while other students chat with their peers. They are used to Ms. M getting sidetracked with basketball conversations.



Adam is a student in Mr. V’s 7th grade ELA classroom. Adam is not doing well in his math class and comes to ELA one day complaining about math. Mr. V has a private conversation with Adam. He asks Adam about the content they are covering in math and shares that he, too, struggled with that content when he was younger. Mr. V tells Adam that some people just aren’t good at math and that there are many jobs that don’t even require it.

Jason comes to class without having completed his homework. His teacher, Mr. A, learned earlier that Jason’s mother had spent the night in the emergency room.  Mr. A asks Jason, in front of the class, if he was missing his homework because of his mother being in the hospital. Jason is clearly embarrassed, does not answer the question, and puts his head down on the desk.
