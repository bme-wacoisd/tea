Gina’s Student Survey Responses

What is your favorite subject? Why is it your favorite?
Science is my favorite because I want to be a doctor. I know you need to be good at science to study to be a doctor.

What is your least favorite subject? Why is it your least favorite?
I don’t like social studies. It all happened in the past, and it’s not important to me anymore. Why would I want to learn about people who died already?

Do you like to learn in groups or on your own? Why?
It depends on who is in my group. When I work with people who want to do the work, I like it. When I work with people who want to mess around and get in trouble, then I want to work on my own.

How do you want to ask for help when you’re confused?
I like to be able to quietly ask the people around me. If I wait until the end of class to ask the teacher, I might just get more confused. And sometimes I think I am the only one who doesn’t understand things, so I don’t like to raise my hand to ask.

What do you do after-school? On the weekends?
I live with my mom and my two little brothers. My mom works second-shift, so I usually must go home and get them off the bus. I make sure they do their homework and eat dinner. My mom sometimes must work on the weekend too. But, when she doesn’t, I like to be with my friends.

How do you like to show that you have learned something new?
I like to tell people about it. If I write something, I can’t really know if anyone ever read it. But if I tell you about it and I see you listening, you know that I learned it.

What makes you most proud of yourself?
I used to be scared about taking science classes, but now I feel better about it. I had some good teachers in middle school, and they helped me know that I can do it.



Gina’s Family Survey Responses
What is your name, and what is your relationship to this student?
Maria. I’m Gina’s mom.
What is your student’s biggest strength at school?
Gina wants to get good grades. She wants to go to college, and she understands how important her grades will be. She does her work, and she pays attention in class.
What is your student’s biggest strengths at home?
Gina is a big help with taking care of her brothers. I know she’d probably like to do other stuff after school, but she comes home and watches them while I work. And she’s really good with them.
What is your goal for your student?
I want her to be happy and have a good job. She wants to be a doctor. It would be great if she did that. But she could also do a lot of other things, and I would be happy. I want her to go to college because I didn’t get to go.
What does your student do when they struggle with something?
She will just try to figure it out on her own. She should probably ask for help more.
What can teachers do to support Gina?
Answer her questions and tell her that she should ask more questions when she is confused. She really likes science, so give her as much science work to do as she can. Believe in her because she needs to hear people say that she can do it.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Read the scenario below and respond to the question. A new student (Tom) has enrolled in Ms. G’s seventh grade class. He used to attend a different school in the same school district. He has been quiet since he joined the class.  What are some strategies that Ms. G can use to find out more about Tom? Think back to our lesson on building relationships with students to develop your list. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Introduction to Learning about Students Using Qualitative and Quantitative Data T: Your Bellringer asked you to think about how Ms. G might get to know her student. What are your ideas?  S: Answers will vary; examples include: Review assignments to learn more about the student. Talk to the student. Access his grades and other academic data. Talk to the student’s previous teachers, coaches, club sponsors, etc. Do classroom ice-breaker activities.  T: Those are great examples. During the last few classes, we’ve discussed the importance of getting to know students and their families. Teachers should use this information to make instructional decisions that support student learning.   T: When I say the word data, what comes to mind?  S: Numbers.  T: That’s right. Most people think of numbers when they think about data. Numbers are one of the important types of data we can collect about students. They are quantitative data. Quantitative data are data that can be counted and expressed in numbers. Quantitative data answer questions like “how many?” and “how often?” Some examples are student test scores and grades and the number of times they have switched schools.  S: (Add definition, questions, and examples to table in Student Guide.)  T: Qualitative data are different, but they are still data because they give us information. They are data that are expressed in words. Qualitative data answers questions like “why?” and “how?” Some examples are the name of a student’s favorite book and the student’s learning preferences (for example, one student might prefer learning by doing hands-on activities).  S: (Add definition, questions, and examples to table in Student Guide.)  T: Why would we want to have both kinds of data?  S: Because they each tell us something different.  T: That’s right. With both types of data, we’re more likely to see the whole picture about a student.  S: (Add answer to question in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Collecting Quantitative and Qualitative Data about Students T: Quantitative and qualitative data about students help teachers support their learning. How do teachers find out this information about their students? There are many possible strategies, and, with most of them, teachers can collect quantitative and qualitative data.  T: Look at your answers to the bellringer. You had great ideas. Let’s use them to build a toolkit of possible strategies for collecting data on students. As we list them, let’s also add whether they help collect quantitative data, qualitative data, or both types.  S: (Add strategies to the toolkit graphic organizer in the Student Guide.)  T: (Reiterate the strategies shared by students during review of the Bellringer. Provide the following strategies, at a minimum, for students to add to their graphic organizer.)  T: Some strategies for the toolkit are: Talk to students’ previous or current teachers. Review student records Give assignments that ask students to share more about themselves. Send home a survey for students’ families to complete. Have informal conversations and ask questions. Administer a student survey.  T: It’s important to think about how you keep track of all the information you learn! There can be a lot of it, and teachers are constantly learning about their students, even after the start of the school year. A great strategy for this is to keep a learner profile for each student.   T: A learner profile is a complete picture of a student’s learning preferences, strengths, and challenges.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Learner profiles can be online or kept on paper, and there are many different formats. I’m going to provide a handout that shows you a few examples of learner profiles. Take two minutes to review them.  T: (Distribute handout with sample learner profiles.)  S: (Review sample learner profile handouts.)  T: While each of the templates is different, they are similar in some ways. What do they share?  S: Answers may vary; examples include: You can find out this information in a lot of different ways. They look at data related to students in and out of school. The students provide a lot of the data, but their families and other teachers provide information as well. | Student Guide Handout with Learner Profile Templates |
| 15 mins | Practice: Collecting Quantitative and Qualitative Data about Students T: We’re going to complete a jigsaw activity to fill out a learner profile for a student. I have several sources of data for Gina, our sample ninth-grade student. Several of you will receive a student survey that Gina completed; some will receive a survey that her family took, and some will receive Gina’s academic record. At the bottom of the page, you’ll see a box for you to take some notes on the important pieces of information you see in the data source. When I hand you the data, review it and jot down your thoughts in that box. You’ll have five minutes for independent review.  T: (Distribute data to students, ensuring that some students receive each type of data.)  S: (Review data provided by teacher and complete box on at the bottom of the page.)   T: (End independent work time.)  T: Now that you’ve finished looking at your data, we’re going to put the data sources together to complete a learner profile for Gina.  S: (Complete the learner profile in the Student Guide.)  T: What is Gina’s favorite subject? Do the people who looked at the Gina’s student survey responses have information that can help us?  S: Science is her favorite subject.  T: Do any of the other data sources help us answer this question?  S: Her mom said that when she answered the survey.  S: She probably likes Spanish too. I saw in her academic record that she decided to take it every year.  T: Great! How about Gina’s least favorite subject?  S: Gina said social studies was her least favorite subject when she answered the survey.  S: Her academic record also shows that her social studies grades have been getting worse over time.  T: Do we know what Gina is most proud of?  S: When she answered the survey, she shared that feels better about science classes.  S: Her academic record shows that too. She’s done better in science every year.  T: Good work. Which of these learning preferences can we check for Gina?  S: In her survey, she said she likes learning independently and in a group. It just depends on the other people in the group.  S: She also said she wants to ask a classmate for help instead of asking the teacher in front of everyone.  T: Good insights. Do we know anything about Gina’s preferences for moving around while learning and learning with background noise?  S: We don’t.  T: How about how she approaches an assignment?  S: We don’t know that either.  T: That means we may want to have additional conversations with Gina. Teachers can always add new information to learner profiles.  T: Someone already mentioned that Gina likes to ask a peer for help when she needs it. What else do we know about Gina and what she does when she needs help?  S: Her mom says she doesn’t always ask for help when she needs it.  S: In her survey, Gina said that she wants help as soon as she gets confused so that she doesn’t get even more confused as the class goes on.  T: Great! What do we know about her out-of-school-commitments?  S: Her mom said that she takes care of her little brothers.  S: Gina said that in her survey too.  T: Great. You’ve done a good job filling in the learner profile with what we know about Gina and identifying some areas where we still have some information to gather. | Student Guide Handout with Sample Student Data |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let’s review what we learned.  T: What are some good examples of qualitative and quantitative data about students?  S: Answers may vary; examples include: Qualitative data could be the subjects they like and information about their family.  Quantitative data could be their grades and test scores.  T: Why would we want to collect both?  S: Because they each tell us different things. When we have both, we know more about a student.  T: Great. As teachers learn information about students, what is a good strategy for them to use?  S: They should put it all in learner profiles.  T: Absolutely! |  |
