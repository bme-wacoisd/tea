Student Guide – Answer Key
Lesson 8.06: Putting it All Together | Multiple Means of Engagement
Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Ms. K is having a difficult time engaging all students in her daily lessons. She uses pictures and videos during her lessons and places students in groups to work together on assignments, but students still seem to be disinterested in the instructional resources, unmotivated to complete the group work, and bored with the topics being discussed. What are three strategies she could use to address these problems?
Student responses will vary but should reference the following:
Learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention. There isn’t one means of engagement that will work for every learner in every context. A learner’s engagement can be influenced by many factors, such as their culture, personal relevance, and background knowledge. Teachers must provide options for:
Recruiting Interest
Allow students choice in how they might reach a learning target.
Provide opportunities for students to engage in learning experiences that are relevant and valuable to their goals and individual interests.
Create a supportive environment where students feel safe to learn and take risks.
Sustaining Effort/Persistence
Explain the important of goals and objectives.
Provide flexibility with tools and resources to challenge and motivate learners.
Foster collaboration and community through flexible grouping
Provide feedback that guides students toward mastery.
Self-Regulation
Support learners in setting personal goals that are attainable and that motivate them to take ownership of their learning.
Provide models, scaffolds, and feedback to help learners develop personal coping skills and strategies.
Support learners in developing an awareness of their progress toward goals and how to learn from their mistakes.

Practice – Lesson Analysis
Work in groups of three to analyze a video lesson from a middle school PE class. Within your group of 3, each person will choose which means of engagement you want to look for during the lesson – recruiting interest, sustaining effort/persistence or self-regulation. Each group member will look for evidence of just that means of engagement as you watch the video lesson. After your group watches the video lesson focusing on just your chosen means of engagement, you will all come back together as a group to share your evidence. With your group, determine how those guidelines come together to build student engagement and understanding.

Evidence of Multiple Means of Engagement from Video Lesson Clips

The strategies used in this lesson increased student engagement by providing students choice and helping them connect their learning to real world examples. The strategies helped students focus on the learning target and provided differentiation in how they completed the activities and in the feedback they received. Lastly, the lesson provided models for how to ask for help and give feedback to peers and allowed multiple opportunities for students to self-assess and reflect on their progress toward the learning target.


| Guideline | Evidence |

| Sustaining Effort and Persistence | Goals posted on the board. Frequent reminders of the learning target Feedback focused on effort and improvement over performance. Provided clear goal for activity with model. Differentiated the level of the stations. Required groups to establish a group leader in their group. Feedback focused on effort and improvement over performance |
| Self-Regulation | Activity allowed students to self-assess and receive feedback. Encourages students to get help from peers. Modeled how to ask for help if they struggled. Encouraged students to use their peers to help. Encouraged students to self-assess and give/receive feedback |
