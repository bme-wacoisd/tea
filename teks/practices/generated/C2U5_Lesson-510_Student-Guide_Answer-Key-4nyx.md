Examine the 1st grade Exit Ticket below. As you read, consider whether the exit ticket meets each indicator of the success criteria or not. Complete the graphic organizer to show your thinking and provide suggestions for improvement if criteria are not met.

Objective: Find the area of a rectangle through multiplication of the side lengths.
- Complete the following multiplication problems:







- Write a multiplication equation to find the area of a rectangle with a height of 6 inches and a width of 8 inches.

- Eliza’s bedroom measures 6 feet by 7 feet. Her brother’s measures 5 feet by 8 feet. Eliza says their rooms have the same exact floor area. Is she right? Why or why not?

#### Jigsaw Note-Catcher




#### Practice 1: Scenario Analysis

Review each scenario below. Work with your home group to determine the best assessment choice for each scenario. Explain your group’s reasoning for each choice.

Jigsaw
Jigsaw is a strategy teachers can use to help students learn with and from each other. Jigsaw is often used when a teacher wants to introduce a significant amount of information all at once. During Jigsaw, the teacher breaks the information into smaller pieces. Working in home groups, students assign different pieces to each member of their group. Home groups then split up into expert groups. In their expert groups, students become experts on their assigned piece of the lesson with other students who have chosen the same piece. After becoming experts on their part of the lesson, they return to their home groups to teach their classmates what they learned and to learn about the other pieces of the lesson from their classmates.


| Indicator | Met/Not Met | Explanation and Suggestions for Improvement (if necessary) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assess what’s most important | Met | Questions 2 and 3 assess students’ ability find the area of rectangles by multiplying sides. The first question is practice in multiplying, which is a component of the objective. |
| Vary question format | Met | There are simple multiplication problems and a word problem. One question is represented visually. |
| Vary question rigor | Met | The first question focuses on simple multiplication. The second question is harder, asking students to write and solve the equation, and the final question is the hardest because it is a word problem and asks students to compare two answers. |
| Keep it short and sweet | Not Met | The first question includes too many problems and does not assess the ability to find area of a rectangle. It can be deleted because it is more of a prior knowledge question. |


| Strategy and Description (What is it? What can a teacher learn from it?) | When to Use/Not Use? | What does the teacher do/say? | What do the students do/say? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gallery Walk – An activity during which students visit stations and record their thinking on shared workspaces. Students may also comment on ideas provided by their classmates. Teachers can learn how students are connecting or drawing distinctions between artifacts, how they analyze artifacts, and how they agree and/or disagree with their classmates. | Use when there are multiple correct answers, when you want to see analysis, when you want to see how students interact with one another’s ideas and can be used when you want students to work together. Don’t use when there is only one correct answer or only surface level answers. | Teacher identifies appropriate artifacts and sets up stations with questions or prompts. Determines how students will engage in rotations (timed or not timed, alone or in groups, etc.) | Students rotate through stations, comment on artifacts based on prompts and using shared workspace, respond to thinking of their peers. |
| Graphic Organizers – Visual representations of learning. Teachers can learn how students are structuring ideas and/or if they can structure ideas in a specified manner. | Use when it is important to see the relationships between ideas. | Teacher determines best type of graphic organizer to use (structured or unstructured) and provides instructions to students. | Students arrange ideas based on pre-determined structure or based on their own thinking. |
| Learning Logs – A record of learning and thinking over time. Teachers can learn not only what students are learning but also how they are learning and what they are struggling with. | Use when student reflection and self-assessment is important. Do not use when you only want to assess content. Use when learning takes place over time. | Teacher creates the learning log (similar to the graphic organizer) with prompts to guide student thinking and reflection. Teacher sets aside time for students to complete logs on a daily or weekly basis. | Students track learning over time by responding to prompts. Students use learning logs in conversation about learning with peers and teacher. |
| ABCD Cards – A visual response to multiple choice questions for informal formative assessment. Can also be modified for paper and pencil multiple choice questions for a more formal assessment. Teachers can learn how well students recall basic information but can also develop more complex questions to assess deeper thinking. | Should be used only when there is one correct choice to each question. | Prepare and provide cards for informal assessment throughout a lesson. Ask pre-planned and spontaneous questions. Create pencil and paper version for more formal assessment at strategic moments in the lesson. | Respond to multiple choice questions with best answer by holding up the correct card (or by selecting on the pencil and paper version). |


| Scenario | Assessment Choice | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ms. Rodriquez wants to assess her students’ awareness of rhetorical devices. She wants to provide students with a quotation and see if they can quickly identify the correct rhetorical device used in the quotation. What kind of assessment might she use? Explain your reasoning. | ABCD Cards | There is only one correct choice for each question. |
| Mr. Tyler is introducing his math students to word problems for the first time. In order to do word problems, students will need to engage a number of skills including reading, problem-solving, identifying important and not important information. He plans for this introduction to take a week and he wants students to think deeply about the process of completing word problems as well as their own strengths and opportunities for learning. What type of formative assessment should he use? | Learning Logs | The assessment takes place over time and is not only about students learning the content but also learning how to problem solve and reflect on their own skills. |
| Mr. Carpenter wants to assess his students’ ability to analyze historical documents – including texts, images, and political cartoons – to identify and engage in discussion about major themes related to the impact of the Industrial Revolution on various economic classes. What kind of assessment(s) might he use? Explain your reasoning. | Gallery Walk | Each historical document is an artifact that can be set up at a station where students can record insights. Students also have an opportunity to respond to one another’s comments and work in groups to discuss before posting responses. |
| Ms. Kahn is teaching her students about ecosystems. Specifically, they are going to learn about how the elements of ponds work together to create ecosystems that sustain a variety of life forms. Students have learned some key vocabulary terms and before she goes further, Ms. Kahn would like to know how students are making sense of the vocabulary terms and their relationship to one another. What type of formative assessment should she use? | Unstructured Graphic Organizer | Graphic organizers are visual representations of the relationships between things. Using an unstructured graphic organizer will allow Ms. Kahn to see how her students are making sense of the information and making connections between the vocabulary words. |
