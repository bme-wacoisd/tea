While delivering directions to his students, Mr. Darcy attempts to communicate that his words are important by speaking at a high volume and at such a rapid pace that some words run together.  His eyes are wide, he is leaning in, and he utilizes a variety of sharp body language gestures to emphasize the importance of the directions.

While delivering directions to his students, Ms. Edna attempts to communicate the importance of her words by speaking quietly, with a consistent cadence and little variation in tone.  Her lower pitch and slower pace allow for the clear articulation of syllables and distinction between words.  Additionally, Ms. Edna employs a symmetrical posture, with her chin up and back straight, steady eye contact, and clasped hands.
