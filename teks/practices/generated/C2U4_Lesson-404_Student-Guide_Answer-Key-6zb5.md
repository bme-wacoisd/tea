### Lesson 4.04: Practice with Attending to the Most Important Content

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Imagine you’re a new sixth-grade teacher and you are planning a lesson with the following learning goal:

Students will compare/contrast authors’ choices when writing an informative essay vs a persuasive essay.

Students are familiar with the definitions and characteristics of persuasive writing and informative writing. Now, you’ll need to give students a task to practice their understanding. You go online, enter the relevant content standard into the search box of a popular lesson-sharing website and examine your options. You find two alternatives:


Activities adapted from https://deansforimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Deans_for_Impact_LbSD_Report_FINAL-1.pdf. – page 3

If you want students to understand the ways an author’s purpose influences their writing, which activity do you choose – and why?
#### Activity 2 is a better example of an activity aligned to the most important content. Activity 1 does provide an opportunity for students to differentiate between persuasive and informative writing, but it does not focus on the choices the author makes.





#### Think-Pair-Share: Attending to the Most Important Content

What do you remember from yesterday’s lesson? Take a minute to record your thoughts below.
Answers will vary.

#### Practice 1: Identifying the Most Important Content

To determine the most important content, ask yourself two questions:
- What do students need to know, be able to do, and understand about the content?
- Where do I want to focus my students’ attention?

Read the scenarios below from a 2nd grade classroom and complete the graphic organizer.

#### Practice 2: Lesson Analysis and Revision

Review the Lesson Plan below. Complete the graphic organizer to analyze and revise the lesson as necessary.
The goal of this lesson for 2nd graders for students to identify story elements as they read and to use those story elements to answer questions about the story (for example: What was the setting of the story? Who were the main characters?).

| Activity 1: Go on a newspaper scavenger hunt. Search for 2 examples of informative writing and 2 examples of persuasive writing and complete the activities below.    Read each article. Then, write a two-sentence summary of each article that includes the author’s purpose. Begin each summary with one of the following paragraph starters: In this article, the author informs the reader about. . .  In this article, the author persuades the reader about. . .   Respond to the following questions.   What kind of writing was easier to find? Why might this be? What kind of writing did you enjoy more? Explain your reasoning. |

| Activity 2: Read the two articles provided about the same topic (a short news articles and a short opinion piece). Complete the Venn diagram to compare/contrast the articles. Pay special attention to the characteristics of each type of essay as you compete the Venn diagram. Then, respond to the questions below:  How can the differences between the two articles be attributed to author’s purpose?  What would the author of the opinion piece need to change if their purpose were to inform?  What would the author of the news piece need to change if their purpose were to persuade? |

| Today you and your class are going to be reading Cinderella. The goal of the lesson is for students to identify story elements as they read and to use those story elements to answer questions about the story (for example: What was the setting of the story? Who were the main characters?). | Students need to know what the story elements are. They need to know definitions of the elements and they need to be able to find them in a story. | I want to focus my students’ attention on the definitions of the story elements and on finding them in the story. |
| Today you and your class are going to be looking at and sorting photographs from the environment below Mount Everest. The goal of the lesson is for students to describe patterns in the kinds of plants and animals that live below Mount Everest. | Students need to be able to describe what they see in the photographs and be able to discern patterns in what they see. | I want to focus my students’ attention on the plants and animals in the images. Specifically, they need to look closely to determine patterns. |
| Today you and your class are going to use various measuring tools to measure objects. The goal of the lesson is for students to find the length of objects using concrete models and determine the length of objects to the nearest marked unit. | Students need to be able to use different measuring tools effectively and they need to be able to identify and use the units on each measuring tool accurately. | I want to focus my students’ attention on the units marked on each measuring tool and on how to use the units when measuring. They will also need to focus their attention on key components of measuring with a ruler – such as how to line up the lines accurately, ensure the ruler is flat and perpendicular. |


| Lesson Activity | Aligned to Most Important Content? (Yes/No) | If no, how might the teacher improve the alignment? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bellringer: Have you ever heard about Cinderella? What do you know about her? If not, what is your favorite story? | No | The bellringer should focus on elements of stories instead of Cinderella. The teacher might change the bellringer to ask: What do you know about stories? If you were writing a story, what do you think you should include? |
| Intro to Story Elements: Teacher will define and provide examples and nonexamples of story elements. The teacher will ask students to share additional examples. | Yes |  |
| Think-Aloud: The teacher will begin reading the story aloud. As the teacher encounters story elements, they will pause the reading and think-aloud, identifying and explaining the element. | Yes |  |
| Guided Practice: The teacher will continue reading aloud and will pause at key moments to ask students what they predict will happen next. | No | The teacher should continue to pause as she encounters story elements. The questions posed by the teacher should continue to be about story elements. |
| Independent Practice: Students will choose a scene from Cinderella and will rewrite the scene changing story elements. | No | Students should read a new story and practice identifying story elements. |
| Exit Ticket: Students will watch a quick video that illustrates a complete story. They will complete a Story Map about the video on which they record elements of the story that were taught today. | Yes |  |
