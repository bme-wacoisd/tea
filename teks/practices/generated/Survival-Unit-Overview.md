| Life at a Pond | All plants and animals have external parts. Lesson 1: Observe the different parts of a pond environment. Lesson 2: Observe photographs to determine that living things have needs and produce offspring. Lesson 3: Observe and sort photographs to identify patterns in plant and animal body parts. Lesson 4: Begin a class model to show how plants and animals survive in a pond environment. | 1.9A - sort and classify living and nonliving things based upon whether they have basic needs and produce offspring 1.10A - investigate how the external characteristics of an animal are related to where it lives, how it moves, and what it eats 1.10B - identify and compare the parts of plants; |
| Animal Body Parts | Animals have body parts with different functions. Animals use their body parts in ways that help the animals survive. Lesson 5: Use models, observe photographs, and view videos to describe the ways animals use their body parts.  Lesson 6: Observe animal body parts to describe the relationship between the properties of animal body parts and their functions. Lesson 7: Explain that animal body parts work together to help the animals survive in a pond environment. | 1.10A - investigate how the external characteristics of an animal are related to where it lives, how it moves, and what it eats |
| Plant Body Parts | Plants have body parts with different functions. These body parts help plants survive.  Lesson 8: Use a model to observe roots, stems, and leaves and to identify their functions.  Lesson 9: Observe plant body parts to describe the relationship between the properties of plant body parts and their functions. | 1.10B - identify and compare the parts of plants |
| Body Parts | Animals use their body parts in ways that help the animals survive. Animal body parts have properties that relate to their functions.  Lesson 10: Describe how a yellowjacket uses its body parts to help it survive. | 1.10A - investigate how the external characteristics of an animal are related to where it lives, how it moves, and what it eats |
| Preparation for Engineering Challenge (Mimicry) | Humans can solve some problems by mimicking how plants and animals use their body parts.  Lesson 11: Examine two human-made products that mimic how plants and animals use their body parts. | 1.10A - investigate how the external characteristics of an animal are related to where it lives, how it moves, and what it eats 1.10B - identify and compare the parts of plants |
| Engineering Challenge | Humans can solve some problems by mimicking how pond plants and pond animals use their body parts.  Lessons 12–16: Apply the engineering design process to create a covering that protects scientists at a pond. | 1.10A - investigate how the external characteristics of an animal are related to where it lives, how it moves, and what it eats 1.10B - identify and compare the parts of plants |


| Concept 2: Sense and Response  Focus Question: How do plants and animals respond to their environment?  Animals have body parts that capture and convey information in the animals’ environment. Plants and animals respond to their environment in ways that help the plants and animals survive. | Concept 2: Sense and Response  Focus Question: How do plants and animals respond to their environment?

| Animal Responses | Animals use their body parts to sense information in their environment, and animals respond to information in ways that help the animals survive. Lesson 17: Make observations from videos to gather evidence that animals sense information in their environment.  Lesson 18: Make observations firsthand or from media to explain that animals use their body parts to sense information. | 1.9B - analyze and record examples of interdependence found in various situations such as terrariums and aquariums or pet and caregiver; and  1.9C - gather evidence of interdependence among living organisms such as energy transfer through food chains or animals using plants for shelter. 1.10A - investigate how the external characteristics of an animal are related to where it lives, how it moves, and what it eats |
| Animal Communication | Animals communicate in ways that help themselves and others survive.  Lesson 19: Analyze information from a modeling activity, videos, and a text to conclude that animals communicate to help themselves and others survive. | 1.9C - gather evidence of interdependence among living organisms such as energy transfer through food chains or animals using plants for shelter. 1.10A - investigate how the external characteristics of an animal are related to where it lives, how it moves, and what it eats |
| Plant Responses | Some plants respond to light in their environment. Lesson 20: Plan and conduct an investigation to test whether plants respond to light. Lesson 21: Analyze data and observe photographs to notice the pattern that some plants respond to light in their environment. | 1.10B - identify and compare the parts of plants |
| Sense and Response | Some plants respond to their environment in ways that help the plants survive.  Lesson 22: Make observations from photographs to notice the pattern that the leaves of a mimosa plant close in response to touch. | 1.10B - identify and compare the parts of plants |


| Concept 3: Parents and Offspring  Focus Question: How do parents help their offspring survive?  Individual plants or animals of the same kind are recognizable as similar, but they can also vary in many ways. Many animal parents engage in behaviors that help their offspring survive. | Concept 3: Parents and Offspring  Focus Question: How do parents help their offspring survive?

| Plants or Animals of the Same Kind | Plants or animals of the same kind are similar but not exactly alike.  Lesson 23: Observe similarities and differences between plants or animals of the same kind. Lesson 24: Use evidence to explain that young plants and animals look very much, but not exactly, like their parents. Lesson 25: Arrange photographs to determine that animals’ life cycles include birth, growth, adulthood, and reproduction | 1.10C - compare ways that young animals resemble their parents 1.10D - observe and record life cycles of animals such as a chicken, frog, or fish. |
| Parent and Offspring Behaviors | Many animal parents and offspring engage in behaviors that help the offspring survive. Lesson 26: Use information from storyboards to explain that many, but not all, animal parents engage in behaviors that help their offspring survive. Lesson 27: Describe animal parent and offspring behaviors that help the offspring survive. | 1.9C - gather evidence of interdependence among living organisms such as energy transfer through food chains or animals using plants for shelter |
| Parents and Offspring | Individual animals of the same kind are recognizable as similar, but they can also vary in many ways. Many animal parents engage in behaviors that help their offspring survive. Lesson 28: Use observations of parents and offspring as evidence that offspring are very much, but not exactly, like their parents and that parents engage in behaviors that help their offspring survive. | 1.10C - compare ways that young animals resemble their parents |
