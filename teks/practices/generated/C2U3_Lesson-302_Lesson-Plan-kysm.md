| 7 mins | Importance of Building Trust and Rapport T: In our last lesson, we discussed how a teacher’s knowledge of students as individuals can be used to guide instruction. Teachers must build relationships based on mutual respect and rapport with students.   S: (Define vocabulary in Student Guide.)  T: What does “mutual understanding” mean?  S: Mutual understanding means that there is a shared understanding of something between two people and those people are friendly towards one another and trust each other.  T: Good. Take a minute to respond in your Student Guide to these questions (display questions on board from PPT): Why do you think it matters for teachers to build trust and rapport with students? How might those trusting relationships lead to a positive impact on student learning?   S: (Spend 1-2 minutes responding to the quick write in Student Guide.)  T: Now, share your responses with a near neighbor before we share with the entire class.  S: (Spend 1-2 minutes sharing responses from Student Guide with partner.)  T: (Select volunteers to share more about their thoughts and brief partner discussion. Student answers will vary.)  T: (Summarize student responses.) Ultimately, building rapport with students can have a positive impact on student learning. When students feel safe , they are more likely to ask questions and take academic risks . It is important to know that building trust and rapport do not happen overnight—these relationships are built deliberately over time.  T: Think for a moment—have you had a trusting relationship with a teacher that was built on mutual understanding and empathy? How did that teacher build rapport with you? (Give students think time)  S: Answers will vary but may include anecdotes about how the teacher took time to listen to the students to get to know them.  If students have a hard time coming up with responses, reframe the question to “How would you want a teacher to build rapport with you? What would you want the teacher to do to gain your trust?”  T: It sounds like many of your responses relate to a teacher taking time to actively listen to you as a person. We call that strategy authentic listening. | Student Guide PPT |
| 8 mins | Using Authentic Listening to Build Trust and Rapport T:  Authentic listening is a strategy to build rapport with students that includes the teacher giving full attention to conversations, demonstrating empathy, and suspending judgment so that the student can be fully heard. Let’s look at the success criteria or different components to effective authentic listening. (Show slide with success criteria/explanation listed.) Give Full Attention. The first step to authentic listening is giving your full attention to the conversation at hand. Limiting distractions, like putting away cell phones or closing laptops, show the speaker that you are fully engaged and present in the conversation. Asking genuine, direct follow-up questions also shows the speaker that you care and are invested in the conversation. Can you show me what it looks like to give full attention? S: (Demonstrate giving full attention)  T: Demonstrate Empathy. Empathy is the ability to share feelings with another person, so demonstrating empathy means that you try to understand feelings as well as words. Students may be nervous to share their feelings with teachers, so being kind, compassionate, and empathetic can allow students to feel more at ease. Suspend Judgment. When practicing authentic listening, suspending judgment is important so that students do not feel like their words or emotions are being judged or thought of as “less than.” Listen with an open mind to students’ concerns. Accept Natural Student Expression. Let students express themselves in their own way. There is no need to correct language or grammar when listening to students to build trust and rapport. Allowing students to come to you as their authentic selves can improve rapport and build deeper trust. Empathy Sentence Starters:  It sounds to me like this might feel…. I can sense that you are feeling… I can hear how [emotion] you are feeling. Your face is telling me that… I can hear in your voice that… Affirming Statements:  Thank you for sharing this with me. I understand you feel that way. That sounds like a(n) [adjective] experience. I hear you. I am not sure what to say right now, but I am here to listen.  S: (Take notes in Student Guide about authentic listening.)  T: I want to give you a handout that can be helpful not only in this lesson, but in your experiences communicating with the students in your field sites, your cooperating teachers, and even your peers and families.   T: (Provide students with Non-Judgmental Language handout.)  T: You can use this to help you with the next activity.   T: I want to show you what authentic listening looks like in the context of a student check-in. We are going to practice the kind of check-ins where the teacher is learning more about the student. These kinds of check-ins are open-ended and oftentimes dictated by what the student wants to talk about. I will use a template to keep track of my check-in that you can also find in your Student Guide (display the template on the slide). You will also use this same template during your own practice session a little later with a partner. Now, I will need a volunteer! (Select student volunteer to conduct the mock check-in.)  T: (Sit next to the student volunteer in the front of the room; can be seated at a desk/table or just with two chairs. Have a printed copy of the template from the Student Guide with you on a clipboard to take notes during the check in as the notes will get reviewed with the class during a debrief session.)  T: To start our check in, I’m going to ask (say student’s name) a couple basic questions. Remember, this check-in is about building trust and rapport with students. (Turn to student volunteer.) So, (say student volunteer’s name), How is your week going so far?   S: (Selected volunteer will respond to teacher.)  T: What are you looking forward to this week?  S: (Selected volunteer will respond to teacher.)  T: What are you not looking forward to?  S: (Selected volunteer will respond to teacher.)  T: Is there anything else you want to talk about today?  S: (Selected volunteer will respond to teacher.)  T: Thank you, (student volunteer.)  T: What did you notice me doing when I was checking in with (say student volunteer’s name)?  S: Answers will vary but may include: You were giving the student your full attention—you weren’t checking your email or looking at your phone. You empathized with the student. You did not judge what the student was saying by making reactive facial expressions or sounds. You let the student express themselves in their own way and did not correct any language or grammatical errors. You asked follow-up questions to let the student know you care.  T: Yes, that’s right, I did all those things. Another thing I did was take some brief notes during the check-in. These notes will help me remember what was discussed during the check-in and how I can follow up with the student. | Student Guide PPT |
| 15 mins | Practice T: Now, you will practice a student check-in with a partner. For 7 minutes, Partner A will be the Teacher and Partner B will be the Student. Then, you will switch roles and Partner A will be the Student and Partner B will be the teacher. (Show students slide with pre-assigned partners.)  T: Remember to use the template in your Student Guide to collect data from your check-in. As a reminder, the success criteria for authentic listening are: Give full attention. Demonstrate empathy. Suspend judgment. Accept natural student expression.  S: (Engage in partner practice, using the template in the Student Guide.)  T: (Keep time while students work through practice—7 minutes and then students will switch roles. Use a timer displayed on the screen/front of the room if possible so students can also self-monitor their timing.) | Student Guide  PPT |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: What was hard for you about our practice activity? What parts of authentic listening might be the hardest to master?  S: Answers will vary but may include: Giving full attention is hard because I could hear my phone vibrating in my backpack, and I started wondering who was texting/calling me. I had a hard time empathizing with my partner because I have never experienced what they were talking about. | Student Guide |
