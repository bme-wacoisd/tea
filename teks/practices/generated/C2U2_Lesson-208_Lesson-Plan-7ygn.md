| Rationale/ Summary | People tend to be motivated by the positive far more than the negative. It is important to guide students to do better while motivating and inspiring them to evaluate their effort by redirecting them in ways that communicate trust and maintain privacy. In this lesson, students will learn about Positive Framing as a way to frame interactions, particularly corrections, in a way that reinforces trust, while still guiding students toward a better course of action.  This is the first of two lessons on Positive Framing: Motivate Effort and Excellence. In this lesson, students will learn how to Challenge students by analyzing examples of this technique in action and drafting a Challenge statement for a scenario. | People tend to be motivated by the positive far more than the negative.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Read the scenario below and revise the statement into a Challenge statement.   Scenario: Students are preparing written responses to questions about a text in preparation for a whole-class discussion. The teacher says, “I need to see better focus from this class. It’s not okay to sit and do nothing.”  Why is the statement in the scenario considered a nonexample of a Challenge Statement?   Draft a Challenge statement.  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Read the scenario below and revise the statement into a Challenge statement.

| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think of a time when someone motivated you to do something you thought would be challenging. How did that motivation impact your efforts? | Student Guide |
| 9 mins | Intro to Challenge! T: Before we begin today’s discussion, let’s review the Six Rules of Positive Framing. (Call on students to name the rules, then display the list on the PPT.) Live in the Now Assume the Best Allow Plausible Anonymity Narrate the Positive and Build Momentum Challenge! Talk Expectations and Aspirations T:  You are going to create a concept map about the idea of challenge. A concept map is a way to visually represent everything you know about a topic. (Direct students to the space for the concept map in their student guide and then model how to create a concept map for them). Write the word challenge in the center of the concept map space on your copy. Ask students to do the same in the student guide).  S: (Follow along with the teacher as s/he models the concept map.)  T: We can experience different kinds of challenge. For example, physical, mental, and academic. (Place these words in circles around the word challenge and then draw a line from each of the types to connect them to challenge). What kinds of things are physically challenging?  S: (Provide several ideas and add them to the map.)  T: Now that we’ve gotten you started, you will work with a partner to continue adding to the concept map.   S: (Work in pairs to complete their concept maps.)  T: (Ask for a few volunteers to share key ideas from their concept maps.)  T: What does it mean to challenge someone?   S: Responses will vary could include: to take part in a competition, to object or question the truth of something, etc.  T: How might a teacher challenge their students?   S: Answers will vary, but could include: teachers creating opportunity for playful competition, using motivating language, etc. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes on Challenge!  T: People thrive when they’re challenged to prove what they can do.  T: Find the section of your Student Guide titled “Challenge Scenarios.”  S: (Turn in student guide to “Challenge Scenarios.”)  T: Will one student volunteer to read the part of Ms. Wood, and one student volunteer to read the part of Kayla?  S: (Raise hands to volunteer.)  T: (Allow student to read through the scenario.)  T: Why was Kayla’s initial solution not the most correct answer?  S: She forgot to add the units of measurement.  T: How does Ms. Wood encourage Kayla to revise her initial solution?  S: Ms. Wood asks Kayla to add the units by saying, “How would a mathematician say it?”  T: What impact do you think this interaction could have for Kayla?  S: Answers will vary, but could include: Kayla will remember to add the units to her answers in the future, Kayla will feel inspired to do more math problems because she sounded like a mathematician, etc.   T: Great, thank you. When challenging students, it is important to make sure you are using strategies that inspire and motivate. There are three success criterion of an effective challenge. Would someone please volunteer to read the success criteria from the PowerPoint?  S: (Volunteer to read the success criteria.)  Inspires students: Exhort students to prove what they can do by building competition into the day.  Maintains Economy of Language: Using fewer words helps students to focus on what they need to do to meet expectations and brings everyone back to the lesson as quickly as possible. Maintains Emotional Constancy: Again, it’s wise to use a neutral tone when delivering redirections of any kind.  T: There are at least four ways you can bring challenge to your students. Can I get a volunteer to read the first challenge types and descriptions?  T: (Use the PPT to review first two ways to challenge students.)   S: (Volunteer reads from PPT.)  T: Thank you. Can I have a volunteer to read the last two challenge types and descriptions?  S: (Volunteer reads from PPT.)  T: Remember that in whatever way you opt to use Challenge, be sure to use Economy of Language (keep it brief). Let your tone and body language reflect the positive message you’re communicating. For example, smile when you deliver your challenge to students. |  |
| 8 mins | Practice 1: Examples and Non-Examples  T: Let’s take a look at some examples for each of these challenge types. (Use the PPT to show students the completed chart with examples of the different types of Challenge statements.)   T: Read through these examples silently and record them in your Student Guide.   S: (Read silently and record in Student Guide.)  T: How do these examples align with the success criteria for Challenge?  S: Answers will vary, but may include reference to pushing students to prove what they can do by building competition, using language of economy, etc.  Upgrade the nonexample  T: You will now look at two statements that do not meet the success criteria. Work with a partner to identify how the statements do not meet the success criteria and adjust the statements to improve them.  S: (Work with a partner to complete the activity in the student guide.)  T: (Circulate through the room as students work to upgrade the statements. Check for and provide feedback on students’ understanding of how the statements meet or do not meet the criteria.)  T: I saw some great examples of how to revise these statements. Who would like to share?  S: (Share revisions to non-examples.) |  |
| 5 mins | Practice 2: Creating Effective Challenge Statements  T: Now you’re going to have the chance to create your own Challenge Statements. In your Student Guide, find Practice 2: Creating Effective Challenge Statements.  S: (Turn to Practice 2.)  T: Read the two scenarios about Mr. Richardson’s science class. Then write a challenge statement Mr. Richardson could use for each scenario.   S: (Write a challenge statement for each scenario.) |  |
|  | Practice 3: Role Play  T: Now, it’s your turn! You will work with a partner to deliver the challenge statements you have just created. Be sure to read your challenge statement as you would if you were the teacher, paying attention to your body language and tone. When your partner is practicing, please record feedback for them in the feedback rubric in your Student Guide.  S: (Deliver challenge statements.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: What is the value in adding competition into the day? How does challenging students through positive framing impact student motivation and effort?  S: Answers will vary. |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
