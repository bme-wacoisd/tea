Students are working independently on a set of math problems from the day’s lesson. Students are expected to subtract using the take from ten strategy. While they work, the teacher circulates the room to observe and take notes. She uses a checklist to record common areas of understanding and common misconceptions.

Assessment #2
Fifth grade math students are engaged in a unit about financial literacy, in which they learn about income, taxes, and budgeting. Throughout the unit, students have solved real-world problems with fractions, decimals, and percentages. The teacher assigns each student a graded project to create a budget for a household. Students are expected to accurately calculate income, taxes, and expenses. Students also need to describe how to balance a budget when income exceeds expenses.
