Bellringer:
In the previous lesson, we learned that it is important to notice behavior that meets and exceeds expectations. In this lesson, you will learn more about positive reinforcement.
Read the statements below and determine whether you believe each to be true. Place a check in the appropriate column and be prepared to compare answers with a partner.












Intro to Positive Reinforcement



Positive reinforcement may include:

- praise and nonverbal communication (e.g., smile, nod, thumbs up)
- social attention (e.g., a conversation, special time with the teacher or a peer)
- tangibles such as stickers
- activities or privileges such as playing a game, sitting in a special place in the class, drawing, etc.
- secondary positive reinforcements (such as checkmarks, tokens or money) for students to use toward a reward.

Keys to Positive Reinforcement – Examples and Nonexamples




Practice 1: Analyze Positive Reinforcement in Action

Watch each video and note how each teacher used positive reinforcement to acknowledge and praise student actions. Record your observations in the chart below.



What was different about the ways the two teachers delivered their positive reinforcement?
The first teacher provided public feedback about students’ actions; the second teacher provided private feedback to a student.


Practice 2: Plan and Deliver Positive Reinforcement
Work with a partner to write 3 scripts for each direction below that a teacher might use to reinforce the behaviors and/or actions they want students to demonstrate for each direction. After you have completed your scripts, get with another partner to practice delivering one of your positive reinforcement statements.

| Vocabulary | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Positive Reinforcement | Feedback to students that follows a desired behavior and increases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated. |
| Praise | When work or behavior exceeds expectations |
| Acknowledgement | When work or behavior meets expectations |
| Traits | A distinguishing quality or characteristic; personal character |


| Key Element | Definition | Example | Nonexample |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reinforce actions, not traits | Praise actions (what a student does), not traits (personal character) to identify actions that students can and should replicate. | “Go back and look at your draft, Kelly. See those cross-outs and rewrites? That’s why your final draft is so strong!” | “Kelly, you are so smart!” |
| Offer objective-aligned praise | align positive reinforcement to the learning objectives | “Scholars, look up here. This is Jason’s paper. He included a solid transition and revised it to contrast the paragraphs more clearly. Now his paper really holds together. Great work, Jason!” | “I like how Cindy is working quietly.” |
| Differentiate Acknowledgement from Praise | Acknowledgement is what you use when a student meets your expectation. Praise is what you use when a student exceeds your expectations. | “Thanks for being ready, Jayden.” (acknowledgment)  “Fantastic insight about the text, Jayden!” (praise) | “Great job working on your assignment” (praising expected behavior)  “You still haven’t used the technical terminology.” |
| Modulate and vary your delivery | vary the setting (public or private) and the volume | Stopping the class to deliver praise publicly – “Not that is how strong, active verbs can give muscles to a sentence!”  Private – Walk up to the student and whisper “Now that is a strong, active verb. It sounds like you write this for a college paper.” | Always delivering praise publicly or privately; always using the same language |


| Teacher | Examples of Positive Reinforcement |
| --- | --- |
