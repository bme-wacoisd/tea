## Slide 7

### Exit Ticket

- Consider the following rollout speech:
- Class, we are going to talk about one of our most important classroom rules today: Be ready and prepared when the bell rings. Do you realize how much learning time can be lost at the beginning of class if you are not ready to go when the bell rings? Let’s do a little math. There are 180 days in a school year. Let’s say that it takes you three minutes a day to get yourselves together, pull out your pencils and notebooks, stop talking with your friends. Three minutes a day may not seem like a lot but over time that’s 9 hours of learning. More than a full day lost. So, get excited! I want everybody to be prepared when the bell rings. Let’s see. Who looks prepared? Mayra looks prepared. Samuel looks prepared. Maria looks prepared. Darius looks prepared. Asa looks prepared.
- Which of the following criteria does this rollout speech meet? On your Exit Ticket, check any/all that apply and explain your decisions. Then rewrite the speech so it aligns with all success criteria.
