| Rationale/ Summary | To support student success, educators must design and deliver instruction from an asset-based mindset. Asset-based teaching requires educators to hold and communicate high expectations for students, make appropriate demands of students, and engage students in their own learning. In this lesson, students will develop their understanding of asset- and deficit-based teaching and how they affect instruction for students. | To support student success, educators must design and deliver instruction from an asset-based mindset.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: For each scenario, consider two possible ways that a teacher could respond. Place a check mark next to the best response and explain your choice underneath the scenario. Scenario 1: A new student has enrolled in Ms. B’s fifth grade class. She noticed that he was speaking Spanish with his parents when they dropped him off at school this morning, and he isn’t speaking to many of his new classmates. Option A: Ms. B administers a reading assessment to determine the new student’s reading level. He can read above his grade level, so she makes sure that he has challenging books for silent reading. Option B: Since Ms. B is pretty sure that her new student doesn’t speak English well, she skips the reading assessment. She gives him a third-grade book for silent reading. Scenario 2: Mr. W teaches high school science. The TEKS for his course state that students should complete lab experiments. Mr. W knows that his students haven’t had much experience in science labs because the district doesn’t have a lot of science equipment. Option A: Mr. W thinks it will be easier for his students to watch videos of the lab experiments rather than complete them on their own. Option B: Mr. W spends time understanding what his students know about working in the lab and provides instruction on basic lab skills before introducing his students to the experiments. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Introduction to Asset- and Deficit-Based Teaching T: Set your bellringers aside. We will come back to them in a moment.  T: The mindset that an educator brings to their classroom is important. How educators view their students shapes how they support them with reaching academic goals.  T: An asset is something that helps accomplish a goal. So, as teachers, we want to think about the assets that our students bring to the classroom. Asset-based teaching focuses on what students can do rather than what they cannot do.  S: (Add definition to table in Student Guide.) T: A deficit is something that makes it harder to accomplish a goal. While all students have areas where they can improve, it’s a problem if teachers focus only on those areas. Deficit-based teaching focuses on what students cannot do rather than what they can do.  S: (Add definition to table in Student Guide.) T: Sometimes, when teachers think about students, they think that students have deficits that they might not have. For example, in our Bellringer, Ms. B thought that her new student could not understand English because she saw him speaking Spanish with his parents. She assumed something about him without having evidence.  T: Let’s consider how teachers act when they engage in asset-based or deficit-based teaching. I’m going to display several teacher behaviors one at a time; for each, write down either asset-based or deficit-based in your Student Guide.  T: (Share each teacher behavior below; create one slide per behavior.) The teacher sets high expectations and helps students meet them. The teacher assumes that students can’t or don’t want to be challenged to learn more. The teacher assumes that education isn’t valued in the students’ home.  The teacher works with students and families to set challenging academic goals. When working with students, the teacher identifies the unique strengths that can help them succeed. The teacher provides students with easy assignments, so they don’t get discouraged. The teacher learns about students to understand what skills they bring to the classroom from their lives outside of school.  The teacher assumes that students who have individualized education program (IEP) plans will not perform as well as the other students.  T: Let’s look at how we should be categorizing these behaviors.  T: (Share completed table on a final slide; completed table found in Student Guide below).  T: What do the behaviors aligned with asset-based teaching have in common?  S: The teacher talks about how they believe in their students and shows it with their actions.  T: What do the behaviors aligned with deficit-based teaching have in common?  S: The teacher doesn’t challenge the students because they think the students don’t want to work hard or aren’t able to do the work. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Identifying Asset-Based and Deficit-Based Teaching T: Now, let’s return to the examples from the Bellringer. Let’s think about Ms. B and Mr. W’s approaches to teaching.  T: Let’s start with Option A for Scenario 1. Does this option show asset-based teaching or deficit-based teaching?  S:  Its asset based.  T: Great! What about the teacher’s behavior shows that it reflects asset-based teaching?  S: Ms. B did not make any assumptions about her new student’s reading level. She gave him an assessment so that she could find out how well he reads and then provided him with books that will help him develop his skills.   T: So, if Option A reflects asset-based teaching, we know that Option B reflects deficit-based teaching. Who can explain why?  S: Ms. B assumed that her student did not understand English. Because on this assumption, she gave him books that might be way too easy for him and not help him learn.   T: For the second scenario, take two minutes and identify which option shows asset-based teaching and which demonstrates deficit-based teaching. Fill in the blanks in your Student Guide.  S: (Fills in blanks in Student Guide.) Option A represents ________________-based teaching. Option B represents ________________-based teaching.  T: Which one of these options represents asset-based teaching?  S: Option B shows asset-based teaching.  T: That’s right. Who can explain why?  S: Because the teacher was thinking about what the students know and how he can build on that to get them ready for the lab.  T: Great job! We know this means that Option A is deficit-based teaching. Who can share why?  S: He is not thinking about what the students need to do well in the course. He wants to make things easy for them. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | T: Now, we are going to give you some additional practice with identifying asset- and deficit-based teaching. Turn to a learning partner near your seat and work together to fill out the chart in the Student Guide. You have 10 minutes to complete the chart.  T: (Assist with pairings as needed and ensure that every student has at least one partner. Groups of 3 may be needed depending on the number of students and arrangement of seats.)  S: (Complete the chart in the Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | T: (End discussion time and bring students together.)  T: (Review each example, asking for student volunteers to share the type they selected and their reasoning.)  S: The first one is asset-based teaching. Mr. M found a way to engage his English language learners fully in his lesson.  S: The second one is deficit-based teaching. The two English teachers are using a stereotype about students in their school to decide what assignments to give. They do not acknowledge that students may be interested in pursuing a variety of postsecondary options that involve additional education.  S: The third one is deficit-based teaching. Because Ms. N knows her students have struggled before, and think writing is hard, she assumes she will need to give them bad grades for writing assignments. In making this decision, Ms. N is focusing on what she perceives as her students’ weaknesses rather than challenging them to become stronger writers.  S: The fourth one is asset-based teaching. By giving his students the option to research holidays other than those celebrated in the United States, Mr. Y is allowing them to develop further knowledge that they already have.  S: The last one is asset-based teaching. The teacher pushed the student to fix their answer and explain why it was incorrect. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let’s review what we learned.  T: What is the difference between asset-based teaching and deficit-based teaching?  S: Asset-based teaching focuses on the strengths that students have and how they can use those skills to learn. Deficit-based teaching focuses on challenges that students face and how they stop them from learning.  T: What are some behaviors that a teacher who uses asset-based teaching would display?  S: They show students that they believe in them and let them know that they can do well in school, even if they need some extra help to be successful. They challenge students and encourage them to work through hard difficult assignments.  T: What are some behaviors that a teacher who uses deficit-based teaching would display?  S: They didn’t push students to do their best. They make assumptions that some students do not want to learn or can’t learn, and they are not challenge them.  T: Why would you want to have teachers use asset-based teaching?  S: Answers will vary; examples include: I want to go to college, and I want a teacher who is hard so that I know I’m ready for it. Some people might think I can’t learn, but I can, and I want my teachers to believe in me. I’m not just a good football player. I’m smart, and I want to be challenged in school. |  |
