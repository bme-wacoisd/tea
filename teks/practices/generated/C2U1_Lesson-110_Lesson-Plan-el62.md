| Rationale/ Summary | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom. This lesson is the second in a series of six focused on the introduction of systems and routines. For systems and routines to work, teachers must get student buy-in. One way to increase student buy-in is to help students own the systems and routines. Careful attention to the roll-out of a routine or system can increase student ownership. In this lesson, student explore roll-out speeches in more depth by considering the characteristics of those speeches when they are delivered effectively. They also work in groups to develop roll-out speeches for classroom routines they developed earlier in the course, as well as receive peer feedback on those speeches. | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Describe how a teacher delivers an effective roll-out speech. Based on the feedback you received on your group’s roll-out speech, what is one thing you feel you are good at, and what is one thing you will continue to work on?  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Describe how a teacher delivers an effective roll-out speech.

|  | In Lesson 1.08, students worked in five groups to design classroom routines. In this lesson, students will need to return to those groups to develop roll-out speeches for those routines. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Describe the information that a teacher will include in a well-developed roll-out speech for a classroom routine. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Video and Notes: Roll-Out Speech Delivery  T: Can I have a volunteer share their response to the bellringer?  S: The teacher will explain why the routine is important. The teacher will also describe all the steps of the routine and model what it looks like when the routine is done correctly.  T: That answer is a great explanation of the content of an effective roll-out speech. However, when we think about a roll-out speech, we want to pay attention not only to what the teacher says, but also how they deliver the speech.  T: Together, we’re going to develop a list of the important characteristics of delivery of a roll-out speech. We are going to do this by watching two videos of teachers delivering these speeches. We’ll identify some characteristics that they have in common when delivering their roll-out speeches.  T: First, we’re going to watch a video of Ms. Kim Iaia. As you watch the video, complete the first row of the viewing guide in your Student Guide.   T: (Play video.)  S: (Complete first row of viewing guide in Student Guide.)  T: Now, we’re going to watch a video of Ms. Beth Verrilli. As you watch the video, complete the second row of the viewing guide in your Student Guide.  T: (Play video.)  S: (Complete first row of viewing guide in Student Guide.)  T: Now, let’s work together to fill out the chart in your Student Guide titled “Effective Delivery of Roll-Out Speeches.” Find that section in your Guide.  S: (Find chart in Student Guide.)  T: What is something you noticed about how both teachers delivered their roll-out speeches?  S: They were both excited about what they were teaching the students.   T: Showing enthusiasm and excitement is an important part of delivering a roll-out speech effectively.  S: (Add to chart in Student Guide.)  T: What’s another thing you noticed about both roll-out speeches?  S: Both teachers were clear. The second teacher even used hand gestures to help explain what she was saying.  T: Being clear is another important part of delivering a roll-out speech effectively.  S: (Add to chart in Student Guide.)  T: What’s another characteristic shared by both teachers?  S: They were both to the point. They told the students what they needed to know, and they didn’t confuse them with a lot of extra words.  T: Being concise is a third important part of delivering a roll-out speech effectively.  S: (Add to chart in Student Guide.) | Student Guide  Roll Out Videos:  Kim Iaia Beth Verrilli PPT |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Roll-Out Speech for Class Routine  T: Earlier in this unit, you worked in five groups to design various classroom routines. Today, you’re going to work in those groups again; this time, you’ll be writing a roll-out speech for the routine you designed, as well as planning for how to deliver it effectively.  T: In your Student Guide, you’ll find a rubric that assesses both the content and the delivery of roll-out speeches. Using what we have learned today, and during the last lesson, as well as the rubric, work in your group to complete the two sections under the rubric in your Student Guide. You will have nine minutes to complete these sections, but please keep in mind that your roll-out speech shouldn’t be more than 3-4 minutes in length. Are there any questions?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: (Set timer for nine minutes.)  T: Move into your groups and begin.  T: (Circulate to assist students who do not remember their group from the earlier lesson and answer questions.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Feedback on Roll-Out Speech  T: Now, you’ll share your roll-out speech with the members of another group. I’ll be pairing the groups together and telling each large group where to sit.  T: (Assign two groups to work together and identify an area of the classroom for them to work.)  T: Let’s move into these combined groups.  S: (Move into combined groups.)  T: Next, each group should identify one person who will deliver the roll-out speech. Do that now.  S: (Identify one person per group to deliver the roll-out speech).  T: Now, the spokesperson for one group will deliver their group’s roll-out speech. The members of the other group should listen carefully and complete the rubric. We’ll switch groups after four minutes.  T: (Set four-minute timer.)  S: (Spokesperson delivers roll-out speech while members of other group complete rubric.)  T: Now, let’s switch. The spokesperson for the second group should deliver the roll-out speech while the students from the other group listen carefully and complete the rubric.  S: (Spokesperson delivers roll-out speech while members of other group complete rubric.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: I’d now like for your groups to trade Student Guides. Each person should be able to review the feedback provided by one of their classmates on the roll-out speech. You will have five minutes to review the feedback silently.  T: (Set five-minute timer.)  S: (Exchange Student Guides and review feedback in rubric.)  T: Please make sure you have your own Student Guide back as we end class. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
