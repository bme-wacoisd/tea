- Look at the following tasks to determine which task is more rigorous based on the guidelines for rigorous tasks listed below. Use the guidelines for rigorous tasks to support your answer.
- Task 1: What is 1/3 of ½?
- Task 2: Ms. Green makes a full pan of brownies to bring to school. She’s going to bring half of the pan to share with her students. She knows many of her students like icing, so she needs to figure out how much icing to make. If she ices one third of the part that she’s taking to school, how much of the whole pan would that be? Write an equation to represent this, and then use a fraction bar or number line to explain your answer.
