Student Guide – Answer Key
### Lesson 8.10: Putting It All Together | Multiple Means of Representation

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: A teacher down the hall heard you are learning about multiple means of representation and wants to know what that means. Create a 60 second overview (“Elevator Pitch”) of this UDL principle to share with this teacher.
Student responses will vary but should reference the following:

Multiple means of representation means presenting information and content in different ways to support learning for all students.
Provide options for perception.
Offer options for customizing the display of information.
Offer alternatives for auditory information.
Offer alternatives for visual information.
Provide options for language/symbols.
Clarify vocabulary and symbols.
Clarify syntax and structure.
Promote understanding across languages.
Present key concepts through multiple media
Provide options for comprehension.
Activate background knowledge.
Highlight patterns, critical features, big ideas, and relationships.
Guide information processing and visualization
Maximize transfer and generalization.

Lesson Analysis Jigsaw


| Guideline | Evidence from Lesson Plan |
| --- | --- |
| Offer options for customizing the display of information | Suggestion for improvement: Provide students with the link to the video so they can change the rate of speech or sound, vary the pace, and watch it again as needed. |
| Offer alternatives for auditory information | Provides visual of map of North America; video of Mojave Desert flyover |
| Offer alternatives for visual information | Explains that the highlighted area on the map is the location of the Mojave Desert |
| Clarify vocabulary and symbols | Taught the word desert by pronouncing the word, breaking it into syllables, and sharing photographs of different deserts around the world, reminded students of the definition for environment – used photograph to help students describe the environment. |
| Clarify syntax and structure | The teacher posts two students’ science logbook and asks students to think about why the drawing look different even though both students took the same video tour. |
| Promote understanding across languages | Provided the Spanish cognate for desert (desierto); provided scaffolds for English Language Learners; made connection to how many cultures use oral storytelling and song to share observations and information. |
| Present key concepts through multiple media | Students went on a video tour, looked at maps, examined photographs and a drawing |
| Activate background knowledge | The teacher activated background knowledge by having students compare their own location with the location of the Mojave Desert. The teacher asked students what they might see if they were in the Mojave Desert to see what student already know about deserts. |
| Highlight patterns, critical features, big ideas, and relationships | The teacher provided tips for how scientist can record their observations. Some use drawings, some use writing, some cultures use storytelling or song. The teacher highlighted student responses that included descriptive details. Students recorded their own observations through drawing/writing in their Science Logbooks recording sheet. The teacher showed two students’ Science Logbooks to have students consider why the drawings look different even though they both took the same video tour – the teacher helped students understand the big idea that students represent things in different ways. |
| Guide information processing and visualization | The teacher helped guide students through the understanding of the word desert by explicitly introducing the term and breaking it down. The teacher walked students through an example of how one scientist recorded his observations through drawings before students had to record their own in a similar way. |
| Maximize transfer and generalization | Students were able to apply their new knowledge by finding on outdoor environment at home that has a variety of plants and writing or drawing their observations of the environment. |
