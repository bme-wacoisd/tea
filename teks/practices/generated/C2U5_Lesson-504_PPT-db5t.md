## Slide 3

### Bellringer

- Review the scenario in your student guide. Place a carrot (^) in the lesson plan anywhere you think would be a good spot for a formative assessment. Then, use the graphic organizer below to explain your reasoning.

### Vocabulary


| Formal Assessment | Structured instructional activities within the lesson in which students and teachers assess the progress of student’s learning to help in the learning process (practice sets, homework, fluency assessment) |
| --- | --- |
| Informal Assessment | Quick conversational or observation-based checks for understanding (thumbs up, white boards, first to 5, feedback on students’ verbal response) |

## Slide 5

### Informal Assessment Strategies


| Strategy | Description | When/Why/How | Benefits / Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Thumbs up, down, sideways | Students use their thumbs to indicate their own self-assessment of understanding. Thumb up means I get it, thumb down means I don’t get it, thumb sideways means I partially understand but still have some questions or confusion. | Use to get a pulse check of how students are feeling about the lesson. Ask students to indicate their level of understanding with thumbs up, thumbs down, or thumbs sideways. | Benefits: The teacher can quickly gauge student confidence in the lesson.   Drawbacks: Because this strategy is a self-assessment, it does not allow a teacher to assess mastery of content. |
| Red, yellow, green cards | Like thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideways, these cards are used to assess students’ self-assessment of their understanding. A green card means I’m good to go, a yellow card means I’m a little confused, a red card means I need immediate help. | Red, yellow, green cards can be used throughout a lesson to monitor student self-assessment. | Benefits: The teacher can quickly gauge student confidence in the lesson; when students are working independently or in small groups, the teacher can quickly prioritize students who are unable to move forward without support   Drawbacks: Because this strategy is a self-assessment, it does not allow a teacher to assess mastery of content. Students may overuse the red card to rely on teacher support. |

## Slide 6

### Informal Assessment Strategies


| Strategy | Description | When/Why/How | Benefits / Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fist to Five | Like cards and thumbs, fist to five indicates students’ self-assessment of their understanding where holding up a fist (zero) indicates total confusion and holding up five fingers indicates complete comprehension. Students indicate levels between by holding up 1, 2, 3, or 4 fingers. | Use to get a pulse check of how students are feeling about the lesson. Ask students to indicate their level of understanding by holding up a fist to five. Explain the indicators the first few times until the assessment becomes routine. | Benefits: The teacher can quickly gauge student confidence in the lesson; provides more nuance than thumbs.   Drawbacks: Because this strategy is a self-assessment, it does not allow a teacher to assess mastery of content. |
| White Boards | Provide all students with a small, individual white board, white board marker, and eraser. Students respond to questions using their personal white board | White boards can be used to assess mastery of content. The teacher poses specific, content-based questions and provides time for all students to write their responses on their individual white boards before asking students to hold up their responses for the teacher to see. | Benefits: The teacher can quickly scan for correct answers; all students are provided the opportunity to answer the question; assesses content.    Drawbacks: The students quickly erase their answers, so the teacher does not have a record of individual responses. The activity provides an overall perspective of the class as a whole, but doesn’t necessarily provide lasting insight about individual students unless the teacher takes the time to record observations between each question. |

## Slide 7

### Informal Assessment Strategies


| Strategy | Description | When/Why/How | Benefits / Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Think-Pair-Share | Students have time to respond individually to a prompt before pairing up to discuss and compare their answers. | Provide a prompt and time for students to respond individually. Then, instruct them to find a partner and provide time to compare and discuss. Teacher circulates and monitors discussions. | Benefits: Provides opportunity for students to learn with and from peers; assesses content.    Drawbacks: Can be time consuming, teacher may or may not have time to hear all student discussions; does not necessarily allow a teacher to gauge individual understanding unless they take time to record observations as they monitor. |
| Four Corners | Students respond to a multiple-choice question by moving to the corner of the room that indicates their choice. | Post letters in each corner of the room (A, B, C, D). Pose a multiple-choice question and ask students to move to the corner of the room that indicates their choice. Provide an opportunity for students to share their reasoning and attempt to convince their peers of the correct choice. | Benefits: Provides opportunity for students to learn with and from their peers; assesses content; allows for movement in the classroom.    Drawbacks: Can be time consuming; students may engage in “group think” by following someone they think has the right answer instead of making their own selection; does not necessarily allow a teacher to gauge individual understanding unless they take time to record observations during the activity. |

## Slide 8

### Informal Assessment Strategies


| Strategy | Description | When/Why/How | Benefits / Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quick Poll | Students respond to poll questions using devices. | Create a poll for students using technology (Poll Everywhere, Mentimeter, Google Forms, Kahoot, etc.) | Benefits: The poll can be used to assess content and will quickly provide feedback to the teacher about percentage correct.    Drawbacks: The teacher may have no indication of individual student responses; students may not have access to technology; technology may or may not work. |
