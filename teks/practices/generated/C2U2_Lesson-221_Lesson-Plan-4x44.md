| Rationale/ Summary | In this lesson, students will practice nonverbal least invasive interventions and develop an understanding of the impact of effective nonverbal corrections on the promotion of desired student behavior, effective classroom climate, safe classroom environment, and enhanced learning for all. | In this lesson, students will practice nonverbal least invasive interventions and develop an understanding of the impact of effective nonverbal corrections on the promotion of desired student behavior, effective classroom climate, safe classroom environment, and enhanced learning for all. | In this lesson, students will practice nonverbal least invasive interventions and develop an understanding of the impact of effective nonverbal corrections on the promotion of desired student behavior, effective classroom climate, safe classroom environment, and enhanced learning for all. |
| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Review your response to the bellringer scenario. What would you change – if anything – from what you wrote at the beginning of the lesson?   Given what you have learned in this lesson, what would you do in this scenario:  While a student is presenting his or her work to the class, another student begins to interrupt with a question for the teacher.   See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Review your response to the bellringer scenario. What would you change – if anything – from what you wrote at the beginning of the lesson?

|  | Prior to beginning the class, ensure you can access the following videos:  Video: Colleen Driggs: Round 1  Video: Colleen Driggs: Round 2  Video: Colleen Driggs: Round 3  Video: Colleen Driggs: Round 4 |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Review the following scenario: When one student in a classroom is responding to a teacher’s question during a class discussion, another student begins to get up from their desk seat to use the pencil sharpener. How would you respond? | Student Guide |
|  | Group Discussion:  T: (Assign students into groups of 3-4)  T: In your groups, share your bellringer responses with and come to consensus on the best way to respond.  S: (Discuss in groups and come to consensus on one response.)  T: Who will share their group’s best response? | Student Guide |
|  | Practice 1: Nonverbal Interventions Scenarios T: For most of today’s lesson, you are going to take turns engaging with TLAC scenarios to practice common nonverbal interventions. You should focus on delivering a nonverbal intervention that communicates the solution while using emotional constancy.  After each member of your group practices each scenario, the rest of the group will provide warm and cool feedback.  T: For the first round, we are going to practice signaling to a student who has raised his hand that he should hold his question until later when you’re finished with your teaching point. Let’s watch an example first.  T: (Show the video of Colleen Driggs modeling the practice.)  T: Now, it’s time to practice. In your groups, give each student an opportunity to practice. The rest of the group will provide feedback. After everyone has gone at least once, you may use your remaining time to practice again based on feedback.  S: (Groups practice signaling for a student to hold his question until later.)  T: Now we’ll practice what to do when a student has put her head down on her desk. Let’s watch an example first.  T: (Show the video of Colleen Driggs modeling the practice.)  T: Now, it’s your turn to practice and give each other feedback. If there is time after everyone in your group has practiced once, you may use your remining time to practice a second time based on feedback.  S: (Groups practice signaling for a student to lift her head off her desk.)  T: Here’s our scenario for Round 3. You have told students that they should take notes while you teach. Then, you notice that a student is playing with her water bottle instead. Give her a Non-Verbal signal to get back on track.   T: (Show the video of Colleen Driggs modeling the practice.)  T: And now it’s your turn.   S: (Groups practice signaling for a student to get back on track.)  T: And now our last round. You told students that they should be looking in their books for evidence. Then, you notice that a student is staring out the window Give her a Non-Verbal signal to get back on track.  T: (Show the video of Colleen Driggs modeling the practice.)  T: Your turn.  S: (Groups practice signaling for a student to get back on track.) | Student Guide  Video: Colleen Driggs:  Round 1  Video: Colleen Driggs: Round 2  Video: Colleen Driggs: Round 3  Video: Colleen Driggs: Round 4 |
|  | Video Notes T: Now that you’ve had a chance to practice, let’s learn a few tips and tricks to make your practice even better.  T: (Show students the video of Doug Lemov providing tips for teachers as they first begin practicing non-verbal interventions.) | Student Guide Video: Non-Verbal Interventions: Doug Lemov |
|  | Practice 2: Nonverbal Intervention Scenarios – Continued T: Using Doug’s tips and tricks to make your practice better, let’s try Round 4 again. Be sure to incorporate any feedback you may have received from your groups as well as the tips and tricks from Doug.   Remember to: Use a Non-Verbal that communicates the solution Deliver your Non-Verbal with emotional constancy Try giving a smile on the Non-Verbal | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Now that you’ve practiced, let’s reflect on what you learned. Based on the feedback you received, what were your strengths?   S: Answers will vary.   T: What aspects of implementation would you improve and why?  S: Answers will vary. |  |
