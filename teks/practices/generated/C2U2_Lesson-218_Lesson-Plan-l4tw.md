| Rationale/ Summary | Teachers need to see what’s happening in their classrooms. In this lesson, students will learn how to set the stage for success by giving observable directions and scanning the room. (Texas TLaC Online)  This is the last of two lessons on Radar: Be Seen Looking. In this lesson, students will practice giving observable directions and following up those directions with a Be Seen Looking “Dance Move.” Students will refer back to the specific, concrete, and observable directions they planned and practiced during a previous lesson and practice delivering those directions using different Be Seen Looking “Dance Moves”. While each person presents, the group members will observe and provide feedback. | Teachers need to see what’s happening in their classrooms.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Analyze the following scene from a classroom: “TLAC Field Guide 2 Clip 59 - Radar/Be Seen Looking.” Students will respond to the following questions and provide specific evidence from the video to support their answers.  How did the teacher effectively use the Radar technique?   How did the teacher use Radar to communicate to students that he was carefully observing their actions?   How did the teacher’s actions promote a positive and effective classroom environment? See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Analyze the following scene from a classroom: “TLAC Field Guide 2 Clip 59 - Radar/Be Seen Looking.” Students will respond to the following questions and provide specific evidence from the video to support their answers.

|  | Prior to beginning this lesson, ensure you can access the following video:  TLAC Field Guide 2 Clip 59- Radar/Be Seen Looking |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: What advice would you give a new teacher who wants to become more comfortable using the Be Seen Looking technique? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | T: (Provide time for students to share with a partner using a routine of your choice – turn and talk, think-pair-share, stand up – hands up – pair up, etc.)  S: (Share with partner.)  T: (Transition to a whole group discussion and ask for a few volunteers to share.) Review Be Seen Looking Dance Moves  T: In the previous lesson, you learned about the different Be Seen Looking “Dance Moves”. Let’s review them. Who wants to be in the “hot-seat” for Invisible Column?  Whoever is in the hot-seat will explain and model the move for the class answer any questions other students have.  Repeat the “hot-seat” for each move.  Invisible Column:  Give directions Move head slightly side-to-side as if you are looking around a column.  Tip Toes:   Give directions. Stand on your tiptoes and look out at the room.  Imagine you are looking at a hard-to-see spot.   Disco Finger:  Give directions.  Tract the track of your gaze in a swivel with one finger pointing to make your swivel obvious.  Imagine thinking, “Let me just check all of these places.”  The Sprinkler:  Give directions.  Start your swivel across the room with pointed finger.  Snap back a few degrees in the direction you just scanned as if you say, “Oh, I think I just saw something I shouldn’t ha... No. Everything is okay.”  The Politician:  Give directions.  Point in recognition to students following directions: one over here, one over there.   The Quarterback:  Give directions.  Crouch and scan.  If you are crouching to confer with one student, use this technique to ensure students across the room see you looking. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Delivering Sample Directions with Be Seen Looking “Dance Moves” T: Now that you’ve had a chance to see the different moves in action again, let’s practice giving observable directions and following up those directions with a Be Seen Looking “Dance Move.” (Texas TLaC Online)  T: (Break students into groups of 3.)  T: For your first round, say “Pencils in the groove and eyes on me.” Then scan the room, using the Be Seen Looking "Dance Move" of your choice.  T: (Provide time for students to practice. As students practice, circulate from group to group to provide feedback. Share feedback based on trends with the whole class between rounds.)  T: For the next round, say “I should see all fingers on the word, ‘the.’" Then, scan the room using a different Be Seen Looking "Dance Move" than the one you tried last time.  T: (Provide time for students to practice.)  T: For your final round, say “You may begin reading and taking notes. “Follow up with a third Be Seen Looking "Dance Move."  T: (Provide time for students to practice.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Delivering Your Own Directions with Be Seen Looking “Dance Moves”  T: Now, let’s try with your own directions. Find the directions you planned during the Building Radar Lesson. With the groups you are in now, deliver your own drafted directions using a different Be Seen Looking “Dance Move.” While your peers present, the rest of the group members will observe and provide feedback using the 2.18 Feedback Rubric.  T: (Pass out the rubric to all students.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: How does Be Seen Looking promote an effective learning environment?  S: Students see you watching and ultimately know that you care and want them to succeed; holds student accountable. |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket in Student Guide.) | Exit Ticket |
