### Lesson 2.19: Positive Reinforcement

Name:
Date:
Read each example statement and decide if it is an example of positive reinforcement or a nonexample. Explain your reasoning. Choose one nonexample and revise the statement to include positive reinforcement.




| Statement | Positive Reinforcement or Nonexample |
| --- | --- |
| Jada, you’ve turned yourself around since this morning. | Nonexample (doesn’t praise a specific action) - “Jada, you’re showing a lot of perseverance. Keep it up!” |
| “Derrick, thank you for listening so carefully during discussion. Your comments have built carefully on what Kiara said.” | Example |
| “Great job bringing a pencil to class today, Alex!” | Nonexample (bringing a pencil to class is an expectation so the student should be acknowledged, not praised) – “Thank you for bringing a pencil to class today, Alex.” |
| “I saw almost everyone clean up diligently after the activity. Thank you.” | Example |
| “I saw a few of you pick up not only your own materials but those of your classmates. Without being asked and without looking for credit. I want you to know that how much I appreciate that.” | Example |
| “I love that you are so punctual and responsible, Mary. Right on time!” | Nonexample (reinforces traits instead of actions) – “Mary, I appreciate you being on time to class today.” |
