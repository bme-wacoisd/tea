| 5 mins | Bellringer: A student’s behavior is disrupting the lesson. The student is yelling out during class and throwing materials. Why would a teacher choose to talk to the student privately instead of redirecting him in front of the other students? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Intro to Private Individual Corrections T: Consider your bellringer. Why do you think the teacher would choose to talk to the student privately instead of redirecting him in front of his classmates?  S: Answers will vary  T: T: Redirecting a student in front of the whole class can be disruptive and potentially harmful. Teachers can instead use least invasive intervention techniques. Redirections are nearly invisible allowing teaching and learning to continue.  T: It’s critical to match your redirection to the student, the behavior, and the context.  Sometimes, you’ll be able to redirect behaviors with a simple Non-Verbal Intervention or with a whole-class reminder of expectations, like Positive Group Correction or Anonymous Individual Correction.  But other times, you’ll need to address a student’s behavior individually, and you'll want to do it as privately as possible.  That’s what the technique that we’ll be exploring today, the Private Individual Correction, is all about. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Important Practices for Private Individual Corrections  T: Today we are going to talk about five key practices for individual corrections. They are:   Maintain Privacy Describe the Solution Use a Warm or Neutral Tone Bookend with Simple Tasks Keep it Brief  T: We’ll talk about each one in more detail in a minute, but first, let’s listen to this interview with Doug Lemov and Nicole Willey, who teaches third grade at Leadership Prep Ocean Hill. Take note of the steps and important practices a teacher should consider when they engage in private individual corrections.  T: (Show students the video interview.)  T: What are some things a teacher should consider when using private individual corrections?   S: Make sure others are doing something else, lower the tone of voice, eye contact, get down to students’ level, give student an observable and actionable goal.  T: Yes, now let’s look at the five keys in more detail. To start, here are a few ways you can maintain privacy during your correction:  Give the class a task to complete so that you're intervening at a time when it's easy to be "off-stage" Circulate for a moment instead of making a beeline to the student so that other students have a moment to get started Crouch down to the student's eye level Speak quietly  T: Why is it important to maintain privacy?    S: It allows the teacher to keep teaching and the students to keep learning, without causing students any embarrassment.  T: (Continue with notes as indicated below.)  Describe the Solution: Describe what you’d like your student to do (as opposed to what not to do) in order to meet your expectations (e.g., “During class discussion, it's important that you give your peers your full attention: eyes and ears on them”).   T: Why is it important to describe the solution?    S: This lets students know what they did wrong while also ensuring they learn from it.   Use a Warm or Neutral Tone: It can be challenging to maintain emotional constancy when delivering a Private Individual Correction, especially if you've already redirected the student several other times in different ways.   T: Why is it important to use a warm or neutral tone?  S: Communicating your frustration with a student through your tone will only undermine your efforts to get the student back on track. Therefore, teachers should use a warm or neutral tone of voice when you speak.  Bookend with Simple Tasks: Start and end your interaction with a pair of observable directions. Start with an “in-task” that students can complete to show they’re ready (e.g., “Pause your writing” or, "Eyes on me, please.") Close with an “out-task” that tells students what they can do to get back on track right away (e.g., “Pick up your pencil and begin right away. Thank you.” or “Start with question 1. Thank you.”)  T: Why is it important to bookend the Private Individual Correction with simple tasks?”    S: The “in-task” ensures that students are ready and attentive for the Private Individual Correction, while the “out-task” returns the student to the desired behavior with little time to dwell on emotions and engage if further back-and-forth.  Keep it Brief: Keep the correction short  T: Why is it important to keep a Private Individual Correction brief?”    S : So the student can get back to the learning task as quickly as possible. | Student Guide Video: Private Individual Correction: Doug Lemov and Nicole Willey |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Video Analysis, Part I T: You are going to watch the video of the analysis of a Private Individual Correction in a fifth-grade math class. You will each capture evidence of one assigned key in the video analysis graphic organizer in the 2.23 Student Guide. After the video, you will share your evidence of one of the five keys of effective implementation. (Assign one key to each student.)     S: (Watch the video and capture evidence of their assigned key.)  T: (Call on students to share their evidence and how it supports their assigned key of effective Private Individual Correction implementation.) | Student Guide Video: Private Individual Correction: Bridget McElduff |
| 8 mins | Practice 2: Video Analysis, Part 2 T: Let’s watch a video of an analysis of two whisper corrections in a fifth-grade math class. Capture evidence of your assigned key in the video analysis guide handout.  S: (Watch the video and capture evidence of their assigned key.)  T: (Call on groups to share the evidence they noted and how it supports their assigned key of effective Private Individual Correction implementation.)  S: (Share the evidence and how it supports their assigned key.) | Student Guide Video: Private Individual Correction: Jason Armstrong |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: Why is it important that a teacher know how to use private individual corrections?   S: Teaching and learning proceeds without interruption and students are not embarrassed. Strong, positive relationships between students and teachers can be maintained.   T: And what are some ways teachers can use private individual corrections?   S: Maintain privacy, describe the solution, use a warm or neutral tone, bookend with simple tasks, keep it brief. |  |
