| 5 mins | Bellringer: Consider the following scenario: Ms. N. is a 7th-grade teacher. She just put students in groups of three to discuss a reading passage they read together in class. As she walks around, she notices some students are already off task. In several groups, one student is doing all the talking, and in another group, students are arguing. What strategies might Ms. N use to prevent these issues from happening? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Introduction to Protocols T: Today we are going to learn about protocols. We will return to your bellringer at the end of the lesson. Let’s start with defining protocol. Please take notes on your student guide.  T: A protocol is a well-defined set of actions used in a classroom for a specific academic purpose. S: (Students take notes on student guide.) T: Protocols are an important tool for promoting learning by creating a safe place for students to share their thoughts and ideas. T: Protocols have a few roles in the classroom. Protocols enhance the structure or clarity of an open-ended task such as brainstorming or generating ideas. Protocols promote equal participation by encouraging students to take turns between listening and speaking. Protocols assign clear roles and tasks so opportunities for collaborative work are maximized.  T: All protocols have some general similarities.  Protocols include a description of what the protocol will do to structure learning. Protocols are organized and have identified what participants will do.  Protocols have timeframes for each step and specify how long participants have to complete each step. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Examining Protocols T: We just learned that using protocols is a strategy that helps structure classroom group discussions. Now we will examine one protocol example.  T: Imagine that students are reading an article about the importance of critical thinking skills. T: Locate Practice 1 – Save the Last Word Protocol in your Student Guide.  S: (Locate Practice 1 in Student Guide.) T: First we will read through the purpose section. Would someone like to volunteer to read the purpose aloud? T: (Wait for someone to volunteer. If no one volunteers, choose one student.) S: (Read purpose section aloud.) T: Remember we are preparing an activity in which students are reading an article about the importance of critical thinking skills. How would this protocol enhance the structure or clarity of an open-ended task such as brainstorming or generating ideas or discussing a text? S: It provides a specific process for discussing the text in a particular order. The protocol will help students process the reading more deeply and to encourage meaningful classroom conversations. T: Now we will read through the directions section. Would someone else like to volunteer to read the first step aloud? T: (Wait for someone to volunteer. If no one volunteers, choose one student.) S: (Read step one aloud.) T: (Repeat for second and third steps.) T: A few minutes ago, we discussed how protocols are used to promote equal participation. How will this protocol engage all students in the discussion?  S: Each student has a turn to share their own quote/passage as well as the opportunity to respond to other students’ selections. Every student in the group participates equally.  T: Now let’s look back at the Bellringer scenario. Take a few moments to read over the Bellringer in your student guide again. S: (Read through Bellringer again.)  T: Protocols assign clear roles and tasks so opportunities for collaborative work are maximized. How would a protocol such as this help students to stay on task?  S: The students were off task because they didn’t know what they were supposed to do during the discussion time. A protocol such as this would give them specific roles.  T: The students in our Bellringer scenario were also arguing. How could the structure of a protocol prevent arguments?  S: The protocol would help students feel like they could all express their opinions.  T: Does anyone have any other questions about the protocol? S: (Ask questions, as necessary.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 2 - Protocol Practice T: Now you will practice analyzing protocols to see how they might support effective collaboration. Locate Practice 2 in your Student Guide. S: (Locate Practice 2 in their Student Guide.)  T: In a moment, I will break you into pairs. Each pair of students will read through the protocols in your Student Guide and complete the analysis chart.   T: Are there any questions?  T: Now I will assign you a partner.  T: (Place students in pairs.)  T:(Set a timer for 10 minutes.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Now that you’ve had time to analyze the protocol with your partner, let’s review what we filled in on our charts together. T: (Allow students to share answers from the protocol practice.)  T: Let’s go back to review our bellringer. What was your original answer to the prompt? Based on what you learned today, is there anything about your answer you might change? S: (Share out answers.) |  |
