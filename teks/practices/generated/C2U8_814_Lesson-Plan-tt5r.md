| Rationale/ Summary | Learners differ in the ways they approach learning tasks and in the way they express what they have learned. There is not one means of action and expression that will be optimal for all learners; therefore, teachers must provide multiple options to allow students to express and communicate their learning. In this lesson, students will review the guidelines for multiple means of action and expression. Students will also analyze a video lesson to find evidence of multiple means of action and expression and suggest additional ways the teacher could have incorporated the guidelines. Students will then use a “Give One, Get One” activity to share their evidence and suggestions. | Learners differ in the ways they approach learning tasks and in the way they express what they have learned.

| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 mins | Bellringer: Complete the matching activity to match the guideline with its correct description and answer the questions to determine which answer choice is NOT an example of one of the guidelines for multiple means of action and expression. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | T: Share how you matched the guidelines with the descriptions.   S:   T: Which answer did you choice as the nonexample and why?  S: Students share their learning through writing a summary because all students share their learning in the same way – through a summary, which doesn’t provide alternatives for students who cannot or do not prefer responding in writing. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Review of Multiple Means of Action and Expression  T: Let’s review some key guidelines and strategies for multiple means of action and expression. (Share image via PPT and review key guidelines and strategies for multiple means of action and expression)    T: What is multiple means of action and expression?  S: Offering options for ways students can interact with the instructional material, demonstrate their learning, and express what they know  T: What are the guidelines for multiple means of action and expression?  S: Options for physical action, expression and communication, and executive functions  T: What are some of the key components or strategies for each of those guidelines?  S: Students can respond with any of the following: Provide options for physical action Provide alternative ways for students to interact with instructional materials and their environment Provide access to and support with tools and assistive technologies Provide options for expression and communication Provide opportunities for students to communicate using multiple forms of media. Allow students to use tools that complement the learning goal Provide differentiated levels of support and scaffolds to support independent learning Provide options for executive functions Support learners in setting challenging and authentic goals  Support learners in developing reasonable plans for reaching their goals  Provide flexible tools and processes to support organization and memory Support learners in analyzing their growth over time and built on it T: Let’s watch a short video clip to see multiple means of action and expression in a 5th grade math class. You can take notes on what you notice in your student guide.  T: What did you notice?  S: Students had access to various tools to engage with the learning, express their learning, and reflect on their learning. | Student Guide  PPT  Video Link |
| 12 mins | Independent Practice – Lesson Analysis  T: You are going to watch two short video clips of a middle school science lesson. As you watch, note evidence of the guidelines for multiple means of action and expression and provide recommendations for additional ways the teacher could incorporate the UDL guidelines for action and expression in your student guide. (Note: if students do not have their own devices, show the videos to the whole class.)  S: (Watch video clips and record evidence in the student guide.)  T: (Allow about 10 minutes for students to watch the video and record notes.)  T: Take a couple of minutes to finish recording evidence and recommendations.  S: (Finalize evidence and recommendations). | Student Guide Video Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU9bzxYQ5PM  Video Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeMncpr5gRQ |
| 12 mins | Group Practice – Give one, Get one T: Now, you are going to engage in a “Give One, Get One” activity to share evidence from the video of the guidelines for multiple means of action and expression and recommendations for additional ways to incorporate the UDL guidelines for action and expression.  T: Let’s look at the procedure for the “Give One, Get One” activity. (Share via PPT).  Step 1: Stand up and mingle with your peers. Step 2: After about 30 seconds, the teacher will call out “Give One”. Step 3: Form pairs and “give” one of your pieces of evidence or additional ways to incorporate UDL to your partner. Your partner will also share an evidence or additional way to include UDL, so each person “gives one” and “gets one.” As you hear new ideas, write them on your student guide. You will have about two minutes with your partner. Step 4: Teacher calls out “Give one.” Step 5: Form new pairs and share. Write new ideas on your student guide  T: Are there any questions about the procedure?  S: (Students ask questions if needed)  T: Get your student guide ready as you will need to take that with you as you move around the room.  T: Stand up and mingle. (allow about 30 seconds)  S: (Students stand up and mingle)  T: Give one.  S: (Form pairs and share one piece of evidence or one additional way the teacher could have incorporated UDL guidelines for action and expression. Students record new ideas in their student guides)  T: (Allow about 2 minutes.)  T: Give one.  S: (Form pairs and share one piece of evidence or one additional way the teacher could have incorporated UDL guidelines for action and expression. Students record new ideas in their student guides)  T: (Allow about 2 minutes)  T: (Repeat process a couple more times). | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Let’s collectively review what we learned.   T: What evidence did you see of the UDL guidelines for action and expression?  S: The teacher provided a notetaking guide, provided students will alternative ways to interact with the material, differentiated the levels of support for independent learning, allow students to share using multiple forms of media, provided scaffolds through graphic organizers, provided time for students to reflect and think about the activity that would work best for their learning.  T: What additional ways did you say the teacher could have included strategies for multiple means of action and expression?  S: The teacher could have provided access to and support with tools and assistive technologies, supported learners in setting a goal for their learning.  T: How did this approach to learning likely impact student learning?  S: It leveled the playing field among learners and allowed the students to appropriately (or easily) access the knowledge and express knowledge, ideas, and concepts in the learning environment. |  |
