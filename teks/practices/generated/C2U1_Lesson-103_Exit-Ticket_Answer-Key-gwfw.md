### Lesson 1.03: Types of Routines

Name:
Date:
Review each of the routines below. For each, identify the type of routine (academic, behavioral, or cultural) and explain how it contributes to a safe and effective classroom.
Routine #1:
When students are finished with a test, quiz, or other classroom activity before others in the class, they are expected to turn the work over and move it to the corner of their desk. Next, students are expected to get out their “book of choice” from the library and read until everyone else has finished.
- Type: Behavioral
- Contribution to safe and effective classroom: Students who are still working are provided the time and space to continue working without interruption by others. Students who finish early can enjoy a text of their choosing.
Routine #2:
During some text-based, small group discussions, students engage in an activity called Say, Mean, Matter. During their own independent reading, students choose a piece of the text that they find important and complete a graphic organizer to paraphrase the text, explain what it means, and reflect on why it matters. Then, in small groups, each student shares their Say, Mean, Matter and the group engages in a responsive discussion.
- Type: Academic
- Contribution to safe and effective classroom: Students are focused during reading on identifying their piece of the text. Focus continues when they move to groups because there is a specific structure and order for the conversation. Finally, all students have the opportunity to share their ideas.
Routine #3:
During classroom discussions during which students may disagree with one another, students are expected to use sentence steps that help them disagree respectfully. Sentence stems include things like “While I see X’s point about Y, I believe. . . “ and “I appreciate X’s perspective that Y, and I think. . . “
- Type: Cultural
- Contribution to safe and effective classroom: Students focus on listening to one another to provide appropriate responses. Students also experience the joy and value of perspective taking and respectful debate.
Answer the question below.
A new student has joined our class. Write down how you would describe the Turn and Talk procedure with them.
When the teacher says to Turn and Talk, you find someone who is sitting near you – right next to you or behind you or in front of you. You turn in your seat so that you are looking at them. Then, you answer the question that the teacher gave.
