| 5 mins | Bellringer From the list below, circle effective strategies that a teacher might use to build relationships with their students.  What affect could it have on a student who spent several years in a classroom with a teacher who did not build strong relationships? Consider the student’s academic progress as well as their attitude about school. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Think-Pair-Share  T: (Provide time for students to share their responses with a partner using a routine of your choice - turn and talk, think-pair-share, stand up – hands up – pair up, etc..  S: (Share and compare responses with a partner.)  T: (Transition to a whole group discussion and ask for a few volunteers to share.) What were some strategies you circled that showed a teacher effectively building relationships with students?   S: The teacher learns all students’ names in the first week of school, breaks down difficult problems but allows students to solve them, greets students every day with a calm voice and a smile, follows through on a promise to have lunch with students on Wednesdays.   T: Why didn’t you circle the other strategies?   S: Answers will vary.   T: How did you respond to question 2?   S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Review Strategies and Techniques T: Let’s start by reviewing the strategies and techniques for developing positive relationships. You may want to take out your student from yesterday.   T: Why is a relationship built on trust and rapport important?  S: They give students a sense of security and confidence, which enables learning.  T: Why should teachers establish boundaries?  S: Because boundaries promote safety and professionalism.   T: Why should teachers be consistent?  S: Consistency builds trust in the teacher and helps students to adhere to routines and systems in the classroom. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Analyzing Scenarios (Examples and Nonexamples)  T: Today, we are going to review a few scenarios to identify what a teacher is doing well and what the teacher might do better to build trusting relationships with their students. Let’s do the first one together. Take a minute to read the first scenario on your student guide.   S: (Read scenario 1.)  T: What did the teacher do well?   S: Students are in a structured environment that is safe. Providing quiet time for students can help them to feel calm before beginning their next class; students have choice as to what they want to do, including listening to the story, laying their heads down, or drawing. Giving students choice is empowering to them.   T: What could the teacher improve?  S: Even though students have choice in what they do, the things they are doing are not productive. Putting their heads down or drawing may not be the most efficient way to spend 10 minutes of the school day. Mrs. Sherron could come up with a quiet activity that is related to the content but that the students would find interesting. Additionally, Mrs. Sherron could allow students to talk and engage with one another through structured games or activities that could build her relationship with the students.  T: Now that we have done one together, you are going to work with a partner to analyze two more scenarios.   T: (Use your classroom procedure to place students into partner groups.)  T:  With you partner, work together to analyze the remaining scenarios, and complete the graphic organizers.  S: (Work with their groups to review scenarios and complete the graphic organizer).  T: Let’s see what you found. What is Mrs. Baker doing well in Scenario 2?  S: Mrs. Baker is building trust with the students by speaking to them in a low voice and not yelling at them in front of their classmates. Additionally, she did not read the note which shows the students she is respecting their privacy. Asking the students to retrieve the note after class will give her a chance to speak with them away from their peers which would eliminate the risk for embarrassment.   T: What could she do better?  S: One of the students was raising her voice, which means the disagreement has escalated. The teacher should suggest the students work in different groups for the duration of the class period to keep the situation from escalating further.   T: Now let’s move to scenario 3. What did the teacher do well in that scenario?  S: When the student explained that he was looking for a pencil, the teacher did not yell or berate him. She reminded him of the expectation to bring his own pencil and allowed him to get back to work.  T: What could the teacher have done better?  S: Students should not go through a teacher or classmates personal belongings without permission. The teacher should walk around the room and when she approaches the students desk crouch down to quietly remind him of the classroom expectations. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Role Play  T: Now it’s your turn to practice with some role play. You and your partner will now pair up with another group of partners. Read the final scenario. Give each person in your group the opportunity to respond to the scenario using different strategies that build relationships. After each round, discuss the impact of the strategies used.  S: (Role play in groups and discuss impact of strategies after each round.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: What strategies for building trusting relationships did your group use to help Mr. Benton in building a positive relationship with students during a time of conflict?  S: Answers will vary.  T: Why is it important to consider relationship building and positive relationships during times of potential conflict?  S: Because if a student trusts the teacher, they are more likely to see that the teacher is coming from a place of care and concern, and not necessarily to punish them. | Student Guide |
