Bellringer:

Consider what you have already learned about multiple means of engagement related to options for recruiting interest and options for sustaining effort/persistence. Today’s lesson will focus on options for self-regulation. Based on where you are in your learning, complete the first two columns of the KWL chart on your student guide.




Guideline – Self Regulation


Practice Scenario
Ms. M. is engaging students in writing conferences during a unit on narrative writing. The goal of today’s writing conferences is to focus students on their character development. Before their writing conferences, Ms. M. shares a checklist with students to help them consider their own work. Along with the checklist, she has asked them to summarize their reflections with two reflection questions and be prepared to share their thinking with her during their conferences. While she conferences with individual students, the rest of the class is working on revisions to other elements of their stories. It’s Student A’s turn to conference with Ms. M.

Take a minute to review Student A’s checklist and self-reflection in preparation for the modeled conference.

Narrative Storytelling: Character Self-Reflection
Review the checklist below.
My characters are believable and consistent. Their actions match what I have said to describe who they are and what they think.
I use action, dialogue, and description throughout my narrative to show not tell information about my characters.
I have included physical traits of my main characters.
I have included personality traits of my main characters.
I have included information about what my main characters feel.
I have included information about what my main characters think.
I have included information about what my main characters believe.
I have included direct characterization.
I have included indirect characterization.
My main character goes through a change from the beginning of the story to the end.

What are your overall strengths related to character development in your story?
I think that my overall strengths are in including a lot of information about my characters. I have very detailed physical descriptions not only of the main character but also of a few of the minor characters. I also remembered to be sure that my main character went through a change by the end of the story.
What are your opportunities for improvement?
I don’t think I am very good at using dialogue to show information about characters. Mostly, I think I tell about my characters and I haven’t actually included a lot of dialogue. I think it’s the same with indirect characterization. I mostly just tell about my characters. I need to do more showing. I think I need to focus more on beliefs and feelings. Those are harder for me than just describing the personality and physical characteristics.
