| Rationale/ Summary | The environment plays an important role in creating a foundation for effective learning. This lesson is the second in a series of two lessons in which students to learn to design an effective classroom space. In this lesson, students will evaluate a lesson design and apply their understanding of effective and safe classroom design to design their own classrooms. | The environment plays an important role in creating a foundation for effective learning.

| Vocabulary | Calm Down Corner | Calm Down Corner | An area in the classroom that is designated for students to regulate and refocus their emotions if they feel overwhelmed. |


| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Prior to this lesson, have materials ready for the students to draw/sketch their future classroom plan. Suggested materials: large paper, markers/colored pencils/crayons, rulers, etc. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: What design considerations have we already learned about that support students who may be exhibiting behavior challenges in the classroom? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Turn and Talk T: We are going to have an opportunity to share out as a whole group in a moment, but I would like for you to turn and talk to a neighbor about your bellringer answer. You have two minutes.  S: (Turn and talk for two minutes.)  T: Let’s come back together. What did you and your partner discuss that you would like to share out?  S: (Share out). | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Calm Down Corner  T: Another important part of a classroom is a calm down corner. Using context clues, what do you think a calm down corner is?  S: Answers will vary.  T: A calm down corner is a place where students can regulate and refocus their emotions if they feel overwhelmed. You may see these more in elementary schools than in middle or high school classrooms, but why might they be useful in those environments?  S: Answers will vary but could include: Because older kids can also sometimes feel overwhelmed, the student would be able to regulate their emotions without leaving the classroom, the students will know the teacher cares about them.   T: Calm down corners do not have to be extravagant, just an area where students can choose to address their negative feelings and hopefully redirect themselves, as opposed to being redirected by the teacher.  T: It is important to note that calm down corners should never be used for punishment. The corner should only be used to promote healthy coping strategies, never negative ones.  T: Do you think it would be best to create a calm down corner in a high traffic or low traffic area of the classroom?  S: Low traffic. Other students could distract or frustrate the student who is in the calm down corner if it was located near a lot of other things in the room.  T: Correct. You would want to pick a small space away from doorways, student work areas, or other high traffic areas. It is also important that there is something physical in the space that defines the area as a calm corner and not just another place in the classroom. This could be a small, comfortable chair, a rug, or anything else that might make the area more comfortable for a child.  T: Many teachers incorporate a toolkit with sensory tools, such as fidgets, that can help students refocus and decompress.   T: It is also helpful if, within the space, there are purposeful decorations and signs to help students select and utilize calming strategies.  T: If you were to put a calming corner in this classroom, where do you think it would go best?  S: Answers will vary.  T: What types of things would be helpful to have in the corner?  S: Answers will vary.  T: What questions do you have about calm down corners?  S: (Ask questions, if any.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 10 mins | My Future Classroom Design:  T: For the remainder of the class, you are going to work on designing your own classroom. You might consider classroom layout, a variety of learning spaces, colors and lighting, strategies for organization, bulletin boards, type of grouping and learning activities, types of transitions, a calm down corner, and classroom technology.  T: In this scenario you are teaching the grade level and content of your choice, which might determine some of the design choices you make.  T: Also in this scenario, you have 26 students. Of those 26 students, 3 have visual impairments and cannot see the board. 2 students need more frequent movement breaks.  T: (Direct students to materials) You have materials available to you to draw your classroom layout. Once you finish your classroom design, write 2-3 paragraphs explaining your classroom design and how it will help create a safe and effective classroom management. | Student Guide Suggested Materials: Large paper Crayons Colored Pencils Markers Rulers |
| 8 mins | Classroom Design: Peer Feedback: T: Now that you have had the opportunity to draft your own classroom design, turn and talk to your neighbor. Share your design with your partner and allow them to give you feedback using the rubric in the Study Guide.   S: Turn and talk. |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: What were some things you saw in your partner review that you really liked?  T: Was there anything in your partner’s plan that you liked but knew would not work in your classroom? What was it and why would it not be a good fit for your future class? S: Answers will vary. |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
