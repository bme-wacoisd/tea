| Rationale/ Summary | The environment plays an important role in creating a foundation for effective learning. This lesson is the second in a series of two lessons in which students to learn to design an effective classroom space. In this lesson, students will evaluate a lesson design and apply their understanding of effective and safe classroom design to design their own classrooms. | The environment plays an important role in creating a foundation for effective learning.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Review the classroom layout provided. Complete the related evaluation and analysis. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Group Discussion: Classroom Layout  T: You will have 5 minutes to work with a partner to compare your responses to the bellringer. Stand up, hands up, and pair up. S: (Stand up, put hands up, and find a partner. Compare responses with their partner. T: What were the strengths of the classroom layout? S: There are aisles between desks to allow teacher access to all students, locked cabinets are against a wall, so they do not obstruct vision, students have easy access to materials T: What were some problem areas?  S: 2 computer desks are under windows which may lead to distracted students, small group tables are between individual desks and the whiteboard so students may get distracted and/or have a hard time seeing the whiteboard, teacher’s chair faces wall instead of students, some students are too far away from the whiteboard and may struggle to see. T: How might you fix the problem areas?  S: Move computer station 1 and 2 to the back wall with station 3, move the small group tables back toward the teacher’s desk so they are behind all of the individual desks, move individual desks closer to the whiteboard.  T: How do your fixes support classroom design that allows for smooth transitions?  S: Moving the small groups out of the individual work desks will allow for smoother transitions by moving the desks closer together and by taking the distracting small group tables away from individual work spaces. T: How do your fixes provide better access to materials?  S: Moving the small group tables to the back of the room away from the individual desks will provide a clearer pathway for small groups to access materials without going through or around individual work desks.  T: How do your fixes limit noise and distraction?  S: Moving small group tables away from individual workspace will limit impact of noise on individuals from small group work, moving computers away from windows will decrease potential distractions outside. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 10 mins | T: Let’s read a little bit more about classroom design. This infographic was created by the Rossier School of Education at the University of Southern California (Provide students with a copy of The Science of Classroom Design.) Please take 8 minutes to review this infographic. As you read, annotate your infographic using the symbols on your student guide. S: (Read and annotate The Science of Classroom Design.) | Student Copies: The Science of Classroom Design |
| 10 mins | T: Now, we are going to discuss what you read using “Conver-Stations.” I am going to divide you into groups of 4. In your first group, you will discuss the first discussion question on your student guide. You will have new groups for each question. (Divide students into groups.) Please move to sit with your group and begin discussing question #1. You have two minutes for your discussion. Take notes on your conversation using your student guide.   S: (Move to their groups and discuss question #1.) T: Thank you for discussing question #1 (after two minutes). Identify two people in your group who will stand up and rotate to the next group. Rotate clockwise. S: (Two students from each group stand up and rotate to a new group.) T: With your new group, discuss question #2. You have two minutes. S: (Discuss question #2.) T: Thank you for your discussions. Identify two people to move to a new group. One should have moved in the first rotation and the other should not have moved in the first rotation. Please stand up and rotate clockwise to your new group.  S: (Identify two people to move. Identified students rotate to their new group.) T: You have two minutes to discuss question #3.  S: (Discuss question #3 with their new groups.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Thank you for your conversations. What insights did you gain from talking to various classmates?  S: (A few volunteers share conversation insights. Answers will vary.) | Student Guide |
