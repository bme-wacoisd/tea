### Closed Questions


| Questions that have a limited number of acceptable answers and are useful to check students’ understanding |  |
| --- | --- |
| Level of Blooms | Can be used at both lower & higher-level questioning |
| Purpose | Questions where there is a limited number of acceptable answers Doesn’t require students to elaborate on their responses Beneficial in helping to retrieve core knowledge & facts |
| Examples | Who was the first person to walk on the moon? How do the hairs on a gecko’s toes work together to help it carry so much weight?   What is the meaning of “tear” as it is used in the text? (higher level) |
| Non-Examples | What benefits have come from space exploration? Why do you think the pilot was/wasn’t fit to do the job? |

| Purpose | Questions where there are many acceptable answers, many of which might not be anticipated by teacher Promotes higher order thinking and building of connections |
| Examples | How are the main character’s actions important to the plot of the story? How can we use the features of a gecko to help us develop modern medicine practices?   How would you describe a metamorphic rock? (lower-level) |

## Slide 11

### Guided Practice

- A 3rd grade teacher is planning instruction for a science lesson with the following objectives:
- Students will define land
- Students will observe land areas and describe their natural features.
- The teacher plans to use an inflatable globe model of Earth.  Students will pass the globe around the classroom and point to an area they think shows land. The teacher wants to ask questions during the activity and after the activity to gauge students understanding of land and find out how students decided which parts of the globe were land.

## Slide 12

### Guided Practice: Question Drafts

- What is this an example of?
- Is this an example of land?
- How did you decide which parts of the globe were land?
- What information do you think a globe gives us about land?
- Why is it difficult to describe land using only a globe?
- What other tools could you use to help you describe land?
- How would you describe land?

## Slide 13

### Exit Ticket

- Draw a line to match each question type with the corresponding definition.
- Analyze the questions (on your Exit Ticket) about a story to determine if they are low/high level and open/closed and explain your reasoning.
