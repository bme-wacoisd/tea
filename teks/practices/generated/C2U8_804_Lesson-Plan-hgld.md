| Rationale/ Summary | If a student isn’t attending to the content, they cannot cognitively engage, but learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention. There isn’t one means of engagement that will work for every learner in every context. In this lesson, students will explore options for sustaining effort and persistence and engage in a rigorous task to experience and reflect on related strategies. | If a student isn’t attending to the content, they cannot cognitively engage, but learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention.

| 4 mins | Bellringer: Describe a time you were given a difficult learning task. Choose one of the following prompts for reflection:  How was the task structured to support your success in completing the difficult task? To what extent were you successful? How did you feel at the end of the task?  What supports were missing from the task that led to a lack of success? How did you feel at the end of the task? | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | T: Turn and talk with a partner to share your experiences.   S: (Turn and talk.)  T: For those of you who wrote about successes with your learning tasks, what were some of the supports provided by the teacher to help you accomplish the difficult task?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: For those of you who wrote about unsuccessful learning experiences, what was missing from the lesson? How did you feel at the end of the experience?   S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
| 10 mins | Introduction to Sustaining Effort and Persistence  T: In our previous lesson, we learned about student engagement and how to spark students’ excitement and curiosity for learning. Today, we are going to explore the next guidelines for engaging students – sustaining effort and persistence. Once a student’s curiosity is engaged, it is important to maintain that curiosity and help students persevere even if learning gets hard. Options for sustaining effort and persistence support ongoing interest in learning.    T: Your learning goal for today is to identify ways a teacher can help students persist through challenges with focus and determination.  T: Sustaining effort and persistence simply means that a teacher helps students learn how to persist through challenges with focus and determination.  T: Let’s look at what sustaining effort and persistence might look like in the classroom. (Share via PPT and walk students through each guideline.)  S: (Take notes in student guide.)  Adapted from CAST (2018). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.2. Retrieved from http://udlguidelines.cast.org  T: How might explaining the importance of a goal sustain effort and persistence?  S: It helps students know the purpose in what they are doing and why it is important, which will likely help students want to push through when things get hard.   T: Why is it important to provide flexibility with the tools and resources students engage with and provide opportunities for collaboration?  S: Providing a range of tools allows students to access the tools and resources that provide them with the level or support and/or challenge that they need to achieve the goal. Collaboration can provide students with support with navigating difficult tasks and assignments.   T: What is the value of timely, specific, and actionable feedback? S: Feedback that is provided during the learning process allows students to know what they need to improve while they are engaged in a task so they can make changes in the moment. Feedback can also sustain effort as students are able to see what they are doing well and how they are improving. Written feedback after an assignment has been completed and graded doesn’t offer the opportunity for students to feel like they are getting better at something over time. T: Look at the four strategies we just discussed. How do these strategies support multiple means of engagement? S: Students have a range of tools and resources they can use to complete a task. Tasks are differentiated to make learning accessible for all learners. Students have flexibility in grouping. Feedback is specific to each student. | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | T: Now, we are going to take a look at a text. I’m going to give you 3 minutes to read it and then I want you to be able to answer some questions about it. Please find the Frankenstein reading passage in your student guide.   S: (Find passage.)  T: I’ve set a time for three minutes. Please begin reading now. (Set and start timer. Sit down at your desk. Do not circulate to help students.)  S: (Read for 3 minutes.)  T: Time’s up. Ready for the questions?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: How did it feel to read this passage?   S: (Answers will vary but some students will likely say it was frustrating.)  T: What was challenging about it?   S: The vocabulary, the sentence structure and length, the ideas.  T: Did anyone feel like giving up? Did anyone actually give up?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Now, let’s try that again. | Text Excerpt from Grade 8C: Science & Science Fiction Unit (in Student Guide) |
| 10 mins | Model of Practice Activity   T: Today, we are going to look at a challenging text. Why do you think it is important to learn to read challenging texts?   S: Because we will encounter lots of different kinds of writing in our lives and some of it may be hard. It is important to figure out how to make sense of something that can be hard to read.   T: Yes! Learning to understand challenging texts is important throughout life. Before we begin reading, let’s think about how you might approach this challenging text. What strategies have worked for you in the past when you have encountered a challenging text?  S: (Student responses will vary.)  T: In just a few minutes, you are going to read an excerpt from Frankenstein. This text was written by Mary Shelley in 1818; therefore, the language used in the text may make it challenging to read.   T: You are going to read the text and then summarize what is happening in the text.  T: Your goal for this activity is to practice persistence as you determine what the text is about.   T: You can use strategies that have worked for you in the past. I am also going to give you a few strategies to help you if you get stuck as you are reading. I will provide you with a bookmark with these strategies to keep with you as you read. (Pass out bookmarks.)  T: Let’s do a quick review of these strategies. How does taking a deep breath and identifying what makes the task challenging help you persist with challenging texts?  S: Taking a deep breath can be calming and thinking about what makes it challenging can help you identify next steps to overcome the challenge.   T: Yes. What about the next two? How do considering what you already know and breaking things down help you with a challenging text?   S: Using prior knowledge can help you make connections to figure out meaning and breaking things into smaller parts can make the challenge easier to manage.   T: I told you that the language in this text might be challenging. What resources do we have to help us with words we don’t know?   S: We have dictionaries.   T: Yes, you are welcome to grab a dictionary. What other resources do you have?   S: We can use the computer to search for the word online.   T: Great idea. And if you search online, you might also be able to find an image of the word which might help you to better visualize. You are welcome to use either of these tools – the dictionary or the internet – to help you with the language in this text.   T: The last two options are to ask a friend or ask the teacher.    T: Let’s read the first sentence together and I will model how I might use my bookmark strategies to support my understanding. (Read first sentence of Frankenstein excerpt aloud.)  T: “One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighboring wood, where I collected my own food, and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau, containing several articles of clothes and some books.”  T: There are some words here that look familiar but are not words I recognize: firing and leathern. I think my prior knowledge might help. The narrator says he brought home “firing” from the woods. Firing sounds like fire and people use wood to create fire so maybe this word means firewood. That makes sense. Leathern here is being used to describe portmanteau. I don’t know what portmanteau means so let me use the internet to see if I can find an image. (Project internet search and search portmanteau.)  T: I see images of suitcases. If a portmanteau is a suitcase, that can help me figure out leathern. It looks similar to the word “leather” and suitcases can be leather, so I think that makes sense.   T: What strategies did I use to help me make sense of this sentence?   S: Prior knowledge and resources in the room.   T: Great. Now it’s your turn. You will have five minutes to continue reading this passage. As you read, use your bookmark strategies and other strategies that have worked for you in the past to help you make sense of the text. | Text Excerpt from Grade 8C: Science & Science Fiction Unit What Do I Do Bookmarks |
| 5 mins | Practice – Reading a Challenging Text S: (Engage in reading and making sense of the text.)  T: (Circulate to answer questions and provide feedback. Be sure to provide feedback on effort and improvement, not performance.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Where did you get stuck in the reading? What were some of the strategies you used when you got stuck?  S: (Student responses will vary.)  T: How did the second reading feel different than the first?   S: I didn’t give up.   T: How was the second activity set up in a way that used the guidelines for sustaining effort and persistence?   S: You began by helping us understand why it was important to learn to understand challenging text. You provided flexibility in tools. We could use strategies we already knew of or the bookmark strategies. For vocabulary, we could use dictionaries or the internet. You allowed us to ask questions of our peers, and you walked around to provide feedback while we were reading.   T: Why is it important for a teacher to provide strategies and support for sustaining effort and persistence and self-regulation?  S: We are always going to face challenges, so we need strategies to help us overcome those challenges. |  |
