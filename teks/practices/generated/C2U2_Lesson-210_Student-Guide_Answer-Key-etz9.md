Name:
Date:
Bellringer:

Answers will vary




Notes: Classroom Rules
Key Term:
Define the key term in the space below.

Classroom rules should be few in number, always apply and must be understood by the intended age group.
Classroom rules should be explicitly taught and modeled.
Classroom rules should be implemented in a way that is firm, fair, and consistent.

Success Criteria for Writing Effective Classroom Rules

Practice 1: Examples and Non-Examples
Classroom Rules Example
Read the rules independently. In the space below, describe how this list aligns with the guidelines for effective rules.





- Includes 3–5 rules
- The rules are appropriate and understandable for the age group
- The rules are easy to monitor and hold students accountable (the are frames as observable behaviors)
- They are all stated positively
- They address important expectations for a class.


Classroom Rules Non-Example
With a partner, identify how the rules do not meet the guidelines and adjust the rules to improve them. You may add, delete, or change any language.

Why do these rules not align with the guidelines for effective rules?
There are too many rules and they are worded very negatively. Also, some of them are obscure or would be difficult for the teacher to observe or manage. Rule #5 does not address a behavioral expectation.
How can the rules be improved?
Combine some of the rules and eliminate others. Rules 1, 5, 8, and 9 can be eliminated. Rules 2, 3, 6, and 7 all emphasize respect and can be combined. Changing some of the language in the rules would make them more focused on positive expectations and less focused on negative behavior.

With your partner, come up with an upgraded example of rules that could be used in this second grade classroom.
Answers will vary but might include:
- Listen for and follow directions
- Raise your hand to participate in class
- Treat people and materials with respect

Practice 2: Upgrade the list from the board
Work with a partner to review the list of rules we came up with as a class from the bellringer. Using what we have learned today, revise this list to fit the guidelines for creating effective rules.
Answers will vary, based on students’ response to bellringer










Practice 3: Design classroom rules

Consider your future classroom. What grade level would you like to teach? What subject? On your own, develop a set of 3-5 rules for your classroom.
Grade level:
Subject:
Answers will vary

| Classroom Rules | Written expectations for behavior in a classroom. |
| --- | --- |


| Guideline | Reasoning | Example | Nonexample |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Limit Number of Rules (3-5) | Limiting the number of rules makes them easy to remember. | Provide an example of a list of four rules or less. | Show an example of a long list of rules. |
| Understandable | Rules must be stated clearly and consistent with students’ age and ability level. | First Grade: Keep hands, feet, and objects to yourself.  This language is clear and would be easy for a first-grade student to understand. | First grade: Respect the personal space, belongings, and contributions of others. This language is not as appropriate or clear for a first-grade student. |
| Observable (Easy to monitor) | Rules should be easily monitored and not require excessive classroom time to hold students accountable. | Raise your hand to participate.  This rule is a behavior that is observable and easy to enforce without taking away instructional time. | Be brave and try new things  This would be difficult to observe or enforce as a rule. |
| Stated Positively | Stating rules positively encourages the desired behavior. Although it is sometimes difficult to state all rules positively, most “don’ts” can be transformed to “do’s.” | Arrive to class on time and ready to learn. The rule is framed positively. | Don’t come to class late or unprepared The rule is framed negatively. |
| Addresses the Most Important Expectations | Rules should represent high expectations for the key values of the class | Treat others with kindness.  This reflects an important value for the class that can be observed in many situations throughout the day. | Sharpen your pencil only at the beginning of class.  This rule is very specific to a behavior at a particular point of the day. |


| Example 1: Middle School Math Class |
| --- |
| Respect yourself, your peers, and their property. Talk at appropriate times and use appropriate voices. Be in your seat and ready for class when the bell rings. Follow directions the first time they are given. |


| Example 2: Second Grade Class |
| --- |
| Ask questions Respect and listen to your classmates Respect and listen to the teacher Raise your hand to speak Look up words you don’t understand No talking when the teacher is talking No talking when classmates are talking Be creative No stealing Follow directions |
