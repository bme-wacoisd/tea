### Bellringer

- Jose just completed a 1:1 student writing conference with his teacher, Mr. Barrier.  Mr. Barrier began the conference by greeting Jose and inviting him first to share his thoughts about where his work writing was strong and some areas where he felt he could improve.  Jose shared that he feels he really struggles with writing his conclusions but that he does a great job supporting his claims with evidence.  Mr. Barrier agreed that providing appropriate and supportive details was a strength of his writing and acknowledged that sometimes it is tough to build a strong conclusion and provided some specific ideas on how Jose might improve.  He asked Jose to go back and re—write the conclusion of his essay based on the feedback.  After the conference, Jose felt confident and got right to re-writing the conclusion to make it better based on the feedback.
