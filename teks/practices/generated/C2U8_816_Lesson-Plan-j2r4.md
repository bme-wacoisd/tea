| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Did you meet the goal that you set during the bell ringer? Explain your answer. Describe how the UDL guidelines were incorporated in the lessons you experienced today as a student by answering the following two questions: What UDL guidelines were used?

| Vocabulary | Universal Design for Learning (UDL) | Universal Design for Learning (UDL) | An educational framework to guide the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences through engagement, representation, and expression. UDL minimizes barriers and maximizes learning for all students. |
| Vocabulary | Multiple Means of Engagement | Multiple Means of Engagement | Providing various ways of engaging with material to stimulate interest and motivation for learning |
| Vocabulary | Multiple Means of Representation | Multiple Means of Representation | Presenting information and content in different ways to support learning for all students. |
| Vocabulary | Multiple Means of Action & Expression | Multiple Means of Action & Expression | Offering options for ways students can interact with the instructional material, demonstrate their learning, and express what they know |

|  | Note: For this lesson, you will need to set up stations around the room – a number to accommodate groups of three and, if possible, give each triad access to a section of white board.  Alternatively, students can use a personal white board, projected computer, or even a sheet of paper for sections of the lesson that involve writing). |  |
| 3 mins | Bellringer: Based on the feedback you received yesterday, what is your goal for delivering your lesson? |  |
| 2 mins | T: Would anyone like to share their goal for delivering their lesson today? S: Volunteers share their goals |  |
| 5 mins | Review Norms T: Today we are going to practice teaching a lesson using the UDL guidelines. You will each get a chance to be the teacher and to be the student. In preparation for teaching this lesson, it is important that we discuss norms for how we will participate in rehearsal as both teachers and students.   T: What are norms? S:  Norms are agreements adopted by a group for how it will do something together and/or behave together. In this case, they are norms for rehearsal teaching.  Look at the proposed norms for the teacher and the role-playing students.  Suggest any additional norms that you would add to these lists. T: (Project norms from student guide on board) | Student Guide |
|  | T: Are there any other norms we should include? S: (Offer any suggestions for norms) T: Do you have any question about what these norms mean for how you participate in lesson rehearsal? S: (Raise questions.) T:  (Clarify or answer student questions.) T: Are there any additional norms that you would suggest making to the rehearsal experience successful? S: (Students may suggest additional norms.) T: (Add norms to the list on the white board or projected.) T: The last step of norm-setting is to ensure that everyone can agree to these norms.  By giving me a thumbs up, can everyone agree to following these norms during rehearsal? S: (Students agree to norms.) T: Great – now let’s practice our lessons. |  |
| 5 mins | Set-up for practice   T: (Set up stations around the room – a number to accommodate groups of three and, if possible, give each triad access to a section of white board.  Alternatively, students can use a personal white board, projected computer, or even a sheet of paper for sections of the lesson that involve writing.)  Note: Larger groups may be preferable if class size and time allows.   T: Today we are going to practice the lessons you prepared to teach yesterday. I will divide you into groups of three around the room. You will get to teach your lesson to two of your classmates who have not seen your lesson.  T: (Break students up into groups of three so that each student in the group has a different lesson; ensure that students take their lesson materials when they move into groups.)  S: (Students move into groups of three.)  T: (Share the PPT.) Our time will be broken up in the following way:  Rehearsal Plan 9 minutes to teach the lesson with other two classmates acting as students. 4 minutes to record reflections on your experience, using either the teacher reflection table or the student reflection table in your student guide. 2 minutes to share feedback with the teacher. 2 minutes for the teacher to reflect on teaching the lesson.  T: Please take a second to look at the teacher reflection table and the student reflection table in your student guide.  S: (Students turn to student guides.)  T: During step two in the process – after the lesson is taught – both the teacher and the student will reflect on the UDL strategies used, how the strategies impacted student learning, and additional strategies or alternatives that could have been included.  You will record what went well and what could have been better in each of those three focus areas before you share in steps 3 and 4.   T: Deliberate practice is spaced over time - that is teachers ask students to return to practice skills you’ve already been taught. It helps cement them in your long-term memory. In earlier units you experienced role playing giving clear directions.  While this unit hasn’t been about giving directions, we give you another chance to practice and get feedback in these lessons.  T: As a teacher, one of the most powerful learning experiences is to observe and be observed by other teachers.   T: As we begin, please remember our norms for the rehearsal.

| 17 mins | Round One: Practice Teach  T: (Display timer with 9 minutes giving the first “teachers” a chance to teach their lesson using the above timing.)  T: Begin teaching your lesson!  S: (Students engage in lesson rehearsal.)  T: (At 9 minutes, teacher stops the rehearsing teachers.)  T: Now, let’s move to 4 minutes to record reflections in your teacher table or the student table in your student guide.  S: (Students reflect in their guides for 4 minutes.)  T: Now I’d ask those of you who participated as students to share some of the feedback with your teacher.  Be as specific as possible.  S: (Students share warm and cool feedback for the teacher.)  T: Finally, let’s give the teacher a chance to share their reflections on the experience of teaching the lesson.  S: (“Teacher” shares their reflection on the lesson.) |  |
| 17 mins | Round Two Practice Teach  T: Now we are going to transition to our second round of practice.  Please select which teacher will go next in your group.  T: (Display timer with 9 minutes giving the second “teachers” a chance to teach their lesson using the above timing.)  T: Begin teaching your lesson!  S: (Students engage in lesson rehearsal)  T: (At 9 minutes, teacher stops the rehearsing teachers.)  T: Now let’s move to 4 minutes to record reflections in the teacher table or the student table in your student guide.  S: (Students reflect in their guides for 4 minutes.)  T: Now I’d ask those of you who participated as students to share some of the feedback with your teacher.  Be as specific as possible.  S: (Students share feedback for the teacher.)
