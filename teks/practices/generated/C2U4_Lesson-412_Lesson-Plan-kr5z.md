| 5 mins | Bell Ringer:  T: (Display questions on the board) What are Directive Prompts? Based on what you learned in the previous lesson, what are two types of Directive Prompts you might use after a student responds correctly? How do Directive Prompts lead to cognitive engagement? S: (Students complete bell ringer in the student guide) T: (Provide an opportunity for students to share out). | Student Guide  PPT |
| 10 mins | Two Ways to Stretch It: Non-Directive Prompts T: Today, we are going to look at another way to Stretch It by exploring Non-Directive Prompts. T:  A Non-Directive Prompt is a phrase to push students to further develop and idea without suggesting what to add. It doesn’t clearly specify how to expand the answer like asking why or asking for evidence does. It simply uses a phrase like, “tell me more” or “can you build on that?” to push students further. T: There are many different Non-Directive ways to prompt students to develop their responses, such as: “Say more” “Keep going” “Develop that” T: What else have you heard teachers say? S: Student responses with vary. T: Sometimes, a Non-Directive prompt doesn’t require a statement. Sometimes a simple head nod, raised eyebrow or a “keep going” hand gesture can be used to signal to students that you want them to elaborate on their responses. T: Let’s see Non-Directive Prompts in Action.  T: As you watch, record evidence on how the teacher uses Stretch It questions to both reveal information about student thinking and build a culture of rigor in your student guide. Indicate if each prompt is a Directive or a Non-Directive prompts. T: (Show Texas TLAC Online “Directive & Non-Directive Prompts: MK Pope) S: (Record evidence in student guide). T: What evidence did you see of Stretch It questions? S: She responds with the following prompts:  What is the monster? (Directive)  Somebody build on it please. (Nondirective) Say more. (Nondirective) How do we know this connects with that idea? (Directive) T: How did the Stretch It questions MK Pope used help reveal student thinking and build a culture of rigor? S: By asking these questions, MK Pope was able to gauge students understanding of the connection between a passage they just read and their previous learning on institutional racism in the United States. By asking Stretch It questions, students had to elaborate to demonstrate their understanding and further develop their ideas. | Student Guide  PPT Texas TLAC Online “Directive & Non-Directive Prompts: MK Pope |
| 10 mins | Practice #1 T: Let’s practice creating our own Non-Directive Prompts by examining a couple student-teacher interactions (Share via PPT).  T: Read interaction #1 Interaction #1: Teacher: Use the word "reassured" in a sentence. Student: My mother reassured me that we were safe inside the house during the storm. T: How could the teacher respond to the student using a Non-Directive prompt? S: Revise to develop that even further; Keep going T: What makes these prompts directive? S: It pushes students to further develop and idea without suggesting what to add.  It doesn’t clearly specify how to expand the answer like asking why or asking for evidence does.  T: Let’s try another example  T: Read interaction #2 Interaction #2: Teacher: What are the three branches of the federal government? Student: The three branches of the federal government are executive, judicial, and legislative. T: Turn to the person next to you and explain how the teacher could respond using a Non-Directive prompt. S: (Students talk with a partner to develop a Non-Directive prompt). T: What were some example prompts you came up with? S: Say more about the ___ branch; Hand gesture to indicate to the student that they need to tell more. T: Why it is important to use Non-Directive prompts?  S: By thinking deeper and elaborating on their understanding, students are engaging the working memory to create meaning and make sense of the content, which helps move the learning into long-term memory. | Student Guide  PPT |
| 15 mins | Practice #2: Role Play T: You are now going to get into groups and role play the use of non-directive prompts. I will give each person in the group a scenario card.  T: These will be the same scenarios we used yesterday, but you will each be given a different scenario to role play. T: You will each have a few minutes to read your prompt and write out a set of Stretch It prompts. Use the guidelines we reviewed earlier to help you develop prompts. After you complete your prompts, you will have time to do a role play in your groups. Non-role-playing students should identify the Stretch It prompt employed and record in the student guide.  T: (Place students in groups and give each student a scenario card.)  S: (Read scenario card.)  T: Based on your scenario, draft a set of Stretch It – Non-Directive Prompts.  S: (Individually draft prompts.)  T: (After a few minutes, allow times for each group member to practice.)   S: (Students will role play their scenario. Non-role-playing students identify which stretch it techniques were employed and record in the student guide.)   Scenario 1: Teacher: Which war was fought between the north and south regions in the United States? Student: The Civil War Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 2: Teacher: Which fraction is larger, ½ or 2/8? Student: The fraction ½ is larger. Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question   Scenario 3: Teacher: If your mom buys 52 grapes and your dad brings home 34 grapes, how many grapes does your family have?  Student: 86 Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 4:  Teacher: Which is larger? 285 or 200 + 30 – 5 + 60? Student: They are equal. Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 5: Teacher: Is the sun a planet, star, or mystery? Student: Star Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 6: “I absolutely love to see the lion tamer perform!” What type of sentence is this? Teacher: Exclamatory Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question | Student Guide  PPT |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: How does the use of meaningful questions, such as directive and non-directive prompts, lead to cognitive engagement?  S: It forces students to think critically and elaborate as opposed to providing a one-word response. It pushes students to make connections and draw on their prior knowledge and learning. |  |
