### Lesson 6.13: Putting It All Together | Lesson Practice

Name:
Date:
Today we are going to practice teaching a lesson. You will each get a chance to be the teacher and to be the student. In preparation for teaching this lesson, it is important that we discuss and set norms for how we will participate in rehearsal as both teachers and students.
Norms are agreements adopted by a group for how it will do something together and/or behave together. In this case, they are norms for rehearsal teaching.
Look at the proposed norms for the teacher and the role-playing students.  Suggest any additional norms that you would add to these lists.
