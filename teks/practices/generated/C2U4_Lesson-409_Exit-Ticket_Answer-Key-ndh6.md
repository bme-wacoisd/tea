Examine the following lesson plan and analyze the tasks using the questions below.
Earth’s Forces 5E Lesson Plan



| Task | What are students physically doing during the task? | Is this task aligned to the guidelines for a rigorous task? (Y or N) | How does this task align to the guidelines for rigorous tasks to help students think deeply about the content? How can you modify the task to ensure students are cognitively engaged? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Video | Students watch a video of Earth’s forces that create the various landforms form | N | Students are asked to watch a video. Students could use a notetaking guide to organize and take notes on the information presented in the video. The questions posed during the discussion are surface level. The teacher could have use questions that force students to think about the why the Earth’s surface is changing and the causes of that change in order to build on prior knowledge, require effortful thinking, and deepen conceptual understanding of material |
| Models of volcanoes, landslides, and earthquakes | Students create a model of each Earth event to determine how they each change the land | N | Students engage in a hands-on demonstration to analyze how each Earth event impacts the land. Although the activity is engaging and hands-on, the teacher could add additional reflection questions that require students to think critically about how and why the event causes the land to change and make comparison between the models and real-world events. This would allow students to build on and extend prior knowledge, involve effortful thought and deepen conceptual understanding of the material. Students could also communicate their understanding of the demonstration to others. |
| KWL | Students complete a KWL chart before and after stations. | Y | This allows students to build on and extend prior knowledge and could involve multiple interpretations or paths to a solution |
| Card Sort Activity | No directions provided. | Unsure | No directions provided to indicate how students might cognitively engage. |
| 3-2-1 | Students had to reflect on what they learned about volcanos, landslides, and earthquakes. | N | This activity has students reflect on their learning but does not provide an opportunity for students to truly demonstrate their deep understanding of the content and does not involve effortful thought. The teacher could ask additional questions that would allow students to use what they learned from the model activity to make connections with real-world events and demonstrate their deep conceptual understanding of the material. This would allow students the opportunity to build on and extend prior knowledge, involve effortful thought, and involve multiple interpretations or paths to a solution. |
