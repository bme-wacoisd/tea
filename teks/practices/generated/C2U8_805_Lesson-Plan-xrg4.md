Model Conference Script
Lesson 8.05: Multiple Means of Engagement
Teacher: (Insert volunteer name here), thanks for meeting with me. How are you feeling about your conference today?
Student: I’m excited to show you my work on my story. I’ve written a lot more since last week.
Teacher: Great! Do you have any other feelings about the conference today?
Student: Well, I’m a little nervous, I guess.
Teacher: What makes you nervous?
Student: Showing you my work. It can be a little scary to share work with someone else.
Teacher: Yes, I agree. Let’s take a deep breath and remember that I’m here to help you make your story better.
(Student and Teacher take a deep breath together.)
Teacher: Now, let’s start with what you think you’ve done well in your story so far to develop your characters.
Student: Well, I’ve provided a lot of detail about my characters – not only the main characters but also some of the minor characters. I’ve included lots of physical description and description of their personalities. I also remembered to make sure my main character changed by the end of the story.
Teacher: That’s great. Can you show me some evidence that your main character has changed?
Student: (Points to paper.) Yes, you see right here at the beginning she is scared about moving to a new home and making new friends. And then later at the end, she has made a new friend and is excited about her first day at school because she has learned how to make new friends.
Teacher: Yes, that evidence shows me that you were able to create a main character who changed in the story. Now, let’s talk about some opportunities for growth and improvement. What do you think you can do to make your story stronger?
Student: I need to work on dialogue, indirect characterization and adding feelings and beliefs to my characters.
Teacher: That’s a lot to work on all at once. What do you think is a good first step for you?
Student: Well, I think I can add some indirect characterization.
Teacher: Can you turn that first step into a goal for our next conference? Begin with “By the end of class today, I will. . . “
Student: Yes, by our next conference I will add at least two examples of indirect characterization.
Teacher: That sounds like a good goal for the rest of the class period. And how will you meet your goal?
Student: I will find two places in the story where I have included direct characterization that can be turned into indirect characterization. Then I will re-write by using dialogue or actions to show what the character is like instead of telling.
Teacher: That sounds like a great next step and a way to improve the characterization in your story!

| Rationale/ Summary | If a student isn’t attending to the content, they cannot cognitively engage, but learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention. Supporting students in setting their own goals and monitoring their own progress is one way that teachers can engage learners. In this lesson, students will explore self-regulation and role play student conferences, which is one way teachers can support self-regulation. | If a student isn’t attending to the content, they cannot cognitively engage, but learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Return to your KWL chart. Complete the final column with information about self-regulation you learned today.   Which of the following scenarios provides a better example of a one-on-one conference? Explain your answer.  Scenario A: Mr. K is using student conferences before a math test. While students engage in practice activities related to the content that will be on the test, Mr. K calls each student to the front of the room for individual conferences. He begins the conference by sharing the student’s quiz grades from the four quizzes given throughout the unit. He asks the student to point out their lowest quiz grade and then reviews the topics assessed by the quiz. He asks the student two write down the list of topics and then asks them what they will need to study before the test.  Scenario B: Ms. S is using student conferences before a math test. The day before students engage in practice activities related to the content that will be on the test, Ms. S provides students with a portfolio of their work throughout the unit and a checklist that guides them through the work to determine their strengths and weaknesses. Then, as students put the final touches on a unit project, she calls them up one at a time to discuss their reflections. She begins by asking each student how they are feeling about the test and then asks them to share their strengths and weaknesses. She ends the conference by showing the students the practice activities that will be available the next day and asks them to identify one or two that will be most important for them to engage in.  Based on your experience in the role play, what is one goal you have for improving your facilitation of one-on-one conferences?

| 3 mins | Bellringer: Consider what you have already learned about multiple means of engagement related to options for recruiting interest and options for sustaining effort/persistence. Today’s lesson will focus on options for self-regulation. Based on where you are in your learning, complete the first two columns of the KWL chart on your student guide. | Student Guide |
| 1 mins | T: What do you already know about multiple means of engagement?  S: (Answers will vary.) T: And what are you hoping to learn today about options for self-regulation?  S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
| 7 mins | Guideline – Self-Regulation  T: So far, we have learned about how to spark students’ excitement and curiosity for learning and how to provide options and strategies that help them persist through challenging material. Today, we are going to explore self-regulation.    T: Self-regulation includes being able to set learning goals, monitor progress towards goals, monitor motivation for learning, and regulate emotions related to learning and setbacks. Self-regulation is a way to help students find their own motivation and strategies to persist through challenges instead of relying on the teacher.  T: Your learning goal for today is to identify ways a teacher can help students set and monitor learning goals and regulate their own emotions and motivation in learning.  T: Let’s see what self-regulation might look like in the classroom. (Use the PPT to review information about self-regulation.)   Adapted from CAST (2018). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.2. Retrieved from http://udlguidelines.cast.org  T: Why do you think it is important for students to set personal goals?  S: (Answers will vary.) Allowing students to set their own goals will lead to increased motivation.  T: Yes, teachers should be sure student goals are aligned to the curriculum. When students set their own goals, they are more likely to be motivated to achieve them, more likely to track their own progress, and more likely to persist through challenges.   T: It is important to note that just modeling alone is not enough. Students need scaffolds such as checklists and ongoing emotional support to learn how to choose strategies for managing their emotional responses when they are faced with challenges.   T: Why is it important for learners to learn how to self-assess and reflect on their learning?  S: Students need to be aware of their progress toward their goal and know what they still need to work on to keep them motivated and on track.  T: Look back at the three strategies we just discussed for self-regulation. How do these strategies support multiple means of engagement? S: The strategies are personalized to the individual student. Students set their own personal goals, self-assess, and reflect on their own learning to determine how to make progress toward their own goal. |  |
| 8 mins | Introduction to Goal Setting and One-on-One Conferences  T: A good place to start with self-regulation is with personal goal setting. Remember that even when a teacher helps students set personal goals, those goals must be aligned to the class standards. What is a standard?   S: Learning goals or expectations for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level.   T: And what are the standards that we use in Texas?   S: TEKS.   T: That’s right. A teacher must make sure that personal goals set by students are related to the standards that are being taught in the course. A teacher should also help students set realistic goals.   T: Why do you think it is important for a goal to be realistic?  S: If students set unrealistic goals, they may become frustrated and quit.  T: Students often need support to learn how to set goals, how to monitor progress, and how to manage setbacks and learn from their mistakes. One way that teachers can support students in learning how to set their own goals and manage their emotions around learning is by using one-on-one student conferences.   T: A one-on-one student conference is a conversation between a teacher and an individual student focused on the student’s learning progress. (Use PPT to review definition and best practices.)  S: (Take notes on student guide.)  T: Today, we are going to practice one-on-one conferences that: Are brief Include attention to the students’ emotions about learning Provide scaffolded opportunity for student reflection on their own learning progress Focus on the student’s strengths and opportunities for growth Include goal-setting End with next steps |  |
| 8 mins | T: Before you try, I am going to model a conference for you. Who will play the role of the student?   S: (Raise hands to volunteer.)  T: (Select one volunteer. Invite volunteer to the front of the room to model a one-on-one conference. Provide the volunteer with the model script.)  T: Please find the conference scenario on your student guide and follow along with me while I read the scenario for the modeled conference. (Read the scenario out loud.)  S: (Find the scenario and read along while the teacher reads out loud.)  T: What questions do you have about the scenario?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: (Respond to any questions asked.) Before we begin the conference, take a minute to review the student’s self-reflection.   T: Now, we are going to model the conference for you. As you watch, take notes on evidence of the characteristics of a conference we just discussed using the graphic organizer in your student guide. | Model Conference Script |
| 11 mins | T: Now, it’s your turn to role play one-on-one student conferences with a partner. Use the same partner from your bellringer this morning.   T: You will use the same writing conference scenario, but your checklist and reflection can look different than Student A’s. You will each have 4 minutes as the teacher to role play a one-on-one conference with a student. Are there any questions before we begin?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: (Respond to any questions.) I am going to set a timer for 4 minutes for the first role play. After the 4 minutes is up, you will have a minute to debrief and discuss how the teacher used the characteristics of one-on-one conferences. The first role play may begin now. (Set timer for 4 minutes.)  S: (Engage in role play until 4 minutes is up.)  T: Take a minute to debrief the role play. How did the teacher address the characteristics of a one-on-one conference? As you debrief the role play, the teacher should take notes in their own student guide about what they did well and what they could improve.  S: (Debrief. Teacher records reflections in student guide.)  T: I am going to set a time for the next role play. You have 4 minutes.   S: (Engage in role play until 4 minutes is up.)  T: Take a minute to debrief the role play. How did the teacher address the characteristics of a one-on-one conference? As you debrief the role play, the teacher should take notes in their own student guide about what they did well and what they could improve.  S: (Debrief. Teacher records reflections in student guide.) |  |
| 3 mins | Debrief  T: How did you feel as a student during the role plays?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: How did the one-on-one conference with a teacher help engage you as a learner?   S: I was able to set my own goal based on my own strengths and weaknesses. My next steps were personal to me, which led to increased motivation. |  |
