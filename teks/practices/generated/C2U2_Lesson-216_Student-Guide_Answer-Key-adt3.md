Key Terms
Define the key terms below



Practice 1: Analyze Building Radar in action

As you watch “Building Radar: Doug Lemov and Jabali Sawicki,” note key points Doug and Jabali discuss that can help a teacher “see the room.”
- How did Kerri intentionally “see the room”?

- Kerri gave specific directions – “pencils down in 3,2,1”. Immediately after giving instructions, she scanned the room to ensure all students were following her instructions.

- Why is it important to scan the room every few minutes and after key directions?

- Looking consistently and intentionally is the first step to seeing, it prevents blind spots, etc.


Notes on Pastore’s Perch
Use this space to record notes on Pastore’s Perch.

- Pastor’s Perch helps teacher’s see more of the room
- If a teacher is standing at the center of the room, they will need to scan a field of 150 degrees to see all students
- If a teacher is standing in the corner of the room – Pastore’s Perch – they only need to scan 80 degrees to see all students
- Field of vision is wider from Pastore’s Perch – there are fewer blind spots


Practice 2: Plan & Deliver

Plan a specific, concrete, and observable direction for a common scenario in the classroom (morning routine, moving into group work, group discussions, packing up, transitioning to a new activity, etc.).

Draft Directions:

Answers will vary





In rounds, each group member will practice delivering their directions utilizing the Radar technique. While each person presents, the group members will observe and provide feedback using the Feedback Rubric provided.

Each round will focus on the following:

- Round 1: Practice delivering the specific, concrete, observable directions you planned.
- Round 2: Practice delivering your directions while scanning.
- Round 3: Deliver your directions, move to Pastore’s Perch, and scan from there.


Feedback Rubric
