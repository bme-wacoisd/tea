| Teacher Feedback | Is this an example of quality feedback? Why or Why not? |
| --- | --- |
| “Well done! You are one smart cookie!” | No, this isn’t an example of quality feedback.  It is not specific or clear and it provides comments that reference the student rather than the task. |
| “Your artwork includes strong lines and contrast.  Next time you might consider adding additional layers or colors to provide more depth” | Yes, this is an example of quality feedback.  It is specific and clear and provides both strengths and areas for improvement. |
| “You calculated the problem correctly, but the question asked you to show your thinking by drawing a picture.  Please re-submit with a picture that explains your thinking.” | Yes, this is an example of quality feedback.  It is specific and clear, recognizing the problem was correct but a picture was required to show student thinking.  It also addresses the strengths as well as areas for improvement. |
| “I don’t like your word choice here” | No, this is not quality feedback.  It is not specific or clear as it doesn’t explain what is wrong with the word choice.  It also seems like a personal preference rather than referencing success criteria. |
