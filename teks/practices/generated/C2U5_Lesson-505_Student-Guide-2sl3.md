Bellringer: Read the scenario and complete the activity below.
The goal of your 4th grade science class today is to teach students to analyze data to describe the relationship between characteristics (category of descriptions, like color) and traits (distinct description, like red). The following are two questions from your lesson:
What is one characteristic of tomatoes?
How would you describe the relationship between characteristics and traits? Provide an example using tomatoes.

Analyze these two questions from your lesson using the guiding questions below.
What is similar about these questions?

What is different about these questions?

How would you describe the thinking required by each question?

Where in the lesson would you expect to find each question and why?


#### Notes: Introduction to Strategic Questioning



#### Practice 1: Question Evaluation

#### Review the lesson objective and related lesson below. Evaluate each question based on the first two criteria for effective questions. If a question does not fit both criteria, revise or make suggestions for improvement.


Lesson Objective: Support a claim that individuals of the same species have the same characteristics but can have different traits.

Basketball Questioning
In Basketball Questioning, the teacher moves questions and discussion responses around the room. The teacher poses a question that is answered initially by one student. Teacher then asks additional students to evaluate and/or add to the initial answer. In this way, ideas and responses are moved around the class and students build on one other another’s ideas and comments.
Use this technique when:
- There is more than one appropriate response to a question

- When you want to build on and connect ideas between students


| Characteristic | Example | Non-Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |


| Question | Is it succinct? | Is if focused on the most important content? | Revisions or Suggestions for improvement if necessary. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What is an example of a characteristic of all humans? |  |  |  |
| What is a trait – by trait remember that we mean something that distinguishes you in terms of a particular characteristic – you have that relates to that characteristic that we just mentioned that is an example of a characteristic of all humans? |  |  |  |
| How are you like a fruit? |  |  |  |
| What is always similar about individuals of the same species? |  |  |  |
| In what ways are individuals that come from the same species and may be alike in many ways also different from one another in other ways? |  |  |  |
| How are plants and animals similar and different? |  |  |  |
