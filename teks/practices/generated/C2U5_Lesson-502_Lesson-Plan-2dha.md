| Rationale/ Summary | Assessment is a vital part of the learning process; however, for assessment to support sound instructional decisions, assessments must be effective. In this lesson, students will learn about the characteristics of effective assessments and will learn to evaluate formative assessments in relationship to those characteristics. | Assessment is a vital part of the learning process; however, for assessment to support sound instructional decisions, assessments must be effective.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Review each scenario in your student guide and determine whether the teacher should use a formative or a summative assessment. | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | T: Stand up, hands-up, pair up! Find a partner and compare your responses.   S: (Stand up and find a partner. Compare responses.)  T: Return to your seats. What questions came up as you discussed with your partner?   S: (Ask any questions that arose.)  T: (Call on students to help answer each other’s questions. Support as necessary to ensure all students have and understand the correct answer for each scenario.) |  |
| 10 mins | Introduction to Characteristics of Effective Assessment  T: Yesterday we learned about formative and summative assessments. Today, we are going to learn about the characteristics of all effective assessments. Take notes as we review the characteristics of effective assessments.   T: (Review characteristics of effective assessments and define terms using the PPT.) Assessment is aligned with learning target(s) and measures appropriate levels of rigor based on learning target (aligned to and requires attention to the most important content) Assessment is fair and transparent (matches expectations of learning focus, not a “gotcha”) Assessment is practical (time, resources, student numbers) Assessment is cognitively engaging (why and how) S: (Take notes in the student guide.)  T: Let us look at an example. Take a minute to read the scenario and exit ticket titled Example 1 on your student guide.   S: (Read the example.)  T: (Annotate the exemplar for students during a think-aloud.) The first question on this assessment asks students to identify the environments that have what plants need to survive. That is aligned to what students learned in the lesson and is related to the learning target because it asks about environments. The second question asks them to develop a claim. Again, this is aligned to the lesson and measures the appropriate level of rigor based on the learning target. If the assessment had stopped after question 1, it would not have met the appropriate level of rigor. To meet the level of rigor in the learning target, students needed not only to identify appropriate environments but also needed to make a claim about those environments.   T: Because this assessment is aligned to the lesson, it is fair and transparent. Students learned what they needed to learn to accurately complete this assessment in the lesson. When an assessment asks about something not covered in the lesson, it does not match the expectations of the learning target and can be considered a “gotcha.”  T: This assessment is practical. There are only two quick questions students are asked to complete. The students can finish the assessment quickly and the teacher can analyze the data quickly.  T: Finally, this assessment is cognitively engaging. Remember from our Science of Learning unit that cognitively engaging tasks require effortful thinking and dig deep into the how or the why of a lesson. In this case, students are asked to develop their own claims about environments. Developing their own claims includes effortful thinking and focuses them on why certain environments are better for plants than others.  S: (Annotate the exemplar as modeled by the teacher.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Analyzing a Non-Example  T: Now, let us look at another example based on the same scenario. Review the example under Practice 1 on your student guide.   S: (Review the example assessment.) T: Turn and talk with a neighbor about the assessment. Why doesn’t it fit with the characteristics of effective assessment?   S: (Turn and talk.)  T: Let us review together. Is the assessment aligned with learning target(s) and does it measure appropriate levels of rigor based on learning target?  S: No, the questions are about plants and the environment, and the first question is aligned, but students are not asked to develop a claim about environments that support plant growth.   T: And does it match the expectations of the learning focus?  S: The first question does but the second question does not. The lesson did not talk about characteristics of plants that helped them survive with limited water.   T: Is the assessment practical?   S: Yes, it is quick to complete and quick to assess.  T: And what about cognitive engagement?   S: Identifying the plants in the images most likely to survive with limited water could be an engaging activity since it addresses how plants survive in conditions that are not optimal. The first question – which is the only one aligned with the lesson – is not very cognitively engaging. | Student Guide |
| 18 mins | Practice 2: Evaluating Formative Assessments  T: Now, you are going to look at two more examples. Find the examples in your student guide. What type of assessments are these?   S: Formative assessments.   T: With a partner, you are going to compare these two examples based on the success criteria. Use the graphic organizer in your student guide to record your thinking. (Assign partners.)  S: (Discuss the assessments using the graphic organizer. Record responses.)  T: Now it is time to choose a side. If you thought assessment A was the better example, move to the right side of the room. If you thought assessment B was the better example, move to the left side of the room. If you are still unsure, stay in the middle.  S: (Move to the location that corresponds with their thinking.)  T: We are going to engage in a U-debate. Each side will have a chance to explain their thinking. As you listen to each side, you are free to move your location as your opinion changes.  T: (Ask for a volunteer from each side to explain their reasoning. Continue to go back and forth between sides encouraging students to respond to each other’s points. End when most students have chosen the correct side. Explain any remaining points of debate.)  S: (Volunteer to explain their thinking. Respond to one another’s points. Move location as they are convinced by their peers.) | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Debrief  T: You just engaged in a teaching strategy called U-Debate. I also used this strategy as an assessment of your learning. Was this a formative or summative assessment?   S: Formative  T: How did the activity align to the characteristics of effective assessment?   S: It was aligned to the learning target because we had to pick a side based on our evaluation of the assessments in relationship to an understanding of the characteristics of effective instruction. It was cognitively engaging because it asked us to explain our thinking – the why and how.  T: What did I learn about your learning?   S: (Answers will vary but should focus on evidence of what students knew and points of confusion.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the exit ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
