What might the school leader want to improve to ensure that their school is highly effective?  Even though Ms. O has an experienced staff, they still need ongoing professional development to learn new and effective strategies. Her school also does not have an improvement plan in place, which is important even though student data is promising. | What are the strengths of this school, based on this lever of the Effective Schools Framework?

| What are the strengths of this school, based on this lever of the Effective Schools Framework? Ms. T’s school has some retention strategies in place, like a retention bonus. Her school also places teachers based on student need, as shown by her shift from 6th to 8th grade science.  What might the school leader want to improve to ensure that their school is highly effective?  Ms. T’s school has a pipeline from the local college into the district, but it is clear that won’t be enough to meet their needs. They should identify other sources of talent. Additionally, the retention bonus is likely not enough to provide a personalized retention strategy. She also needs more support through PD for the new curriculum she is using. | What are the strengths of this school, based on this lever of the Effective Schools Framework?
