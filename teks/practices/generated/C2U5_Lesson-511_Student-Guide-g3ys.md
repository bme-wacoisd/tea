### Lesson 5.11: Characteristics of Effective Summative Assessments | Introduction to Summative Assessment Practices

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:  What is the purpose of summative assessment?  How is it different from formative assessment?


#### Notes: Types of summative assessments



#### Practice 1: Identification and Assessment of Effective Summative Assessment


A first-grade math teacher is planning her assessment for a unit on developing number sense.  She has the following content and skills that she wants to assess at the end of the unit:
- Construct and/or explain different representations of a chosen number
- Count up to and from the chosen number
- Explain ideas using mathematical language
- Connect mathematical knowledge to other ideas in math, other disciplines, or everyday experiences
- Demonstrate mathematical reasoning by justifying their work
She is considering three different options for a summative assessment.  She can dedicate one to two days for assessment if needed but really wants her students to engage in this task as number sense is a foundational concept in her math curriculum.

Which of the following should the teacher choose as her assessment for the unit?  Justify your answer using details from the scenario and characteristics of effective assessment.

Practice 2:  Revising Effective Summative Assessment
Using the examples of summative assessment provided in practice 1, what recommendations would you make to each to align it better to the characteristics of effective assessment?

Practice 3: Analyzing, Evaluating, and Revising Summative Assessments
A Health and PE teacher is planning a unit on nutrition.  The goals for the unit include:
- Explain the importance of a diet in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
- Understand the importance of consuming a variety of nutrient dense foods and beverages in moderation.
- Select a variety of nutritious foods that align to the guidelines of a healthy diet.
Below are some descriptions of potential summative assessments.  Identify the type of assessment and then provide recommendations on how to better align that assessment to the characteristics of effective assessment.




| Type of Assessment | Description | Purpose/Benefits/Challenges |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quiz |  |  |
| Test |  |  |
| Essay |  |  |
| Project |  |  |
| Performance tasks |  |  |
| Portfolio |  |  |


| Description of Assessment | What Type of Assessment? | Is this an example of effective assessment? Why/Why not? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assign several questions that ask students to draw pictures of different numbers, match pictures with numbers and fill in missing numbers from a sequence of numbers on a line |  |  |
| Assign the students a scenario where they are developing an episode on a popular children’s show.  Ask the students to create an episode where they can choose any number, they want but need to display at least 4 different ways to represent the number, demonstrate how to count in different ways for this number and explain why you chose the number.  The information can be presented as a book or poster and the student will present the episode to the class. |  |  |
| Assign students to create a flip book that shows different representations of a number.  They can use any materials they want to create the representations but must show at least 3 different ways to count the number and represent it. |  |  |


| Assessment Example | Suggestions for Improvement |
| --- | --- |
| Assign several questions that ask students to draw pictures of different numbers, match pictures with numbers and fill in missing numbers from a sequence of numbers on a line |  |
| Assign students to create a flip book that shows different representations of a number.  They can use any materials they want to create the representations but must show at least 3 different ways to count the number and represent it. |  |


| Description of Assessment | Type of Assessment | Adjustments to make it an effective assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Students will keep a food diary for a week, recording what they eat each day. |  |  |
| Students will answer a number of questions about nutritional guidelines.  Students will be asked to classify examples of foods as “healthy” or “unhealthy” |  |  |
| Students will be given the prompt “How does nutrition impact your overall health and well-being?” and students will respond in writing. |  |  |
| Students will create a nutritionally balanced menu for campers at an outdoor residential camp.  The menu will consist of breakfast, lunch, and dinner and 3 snacks each day. |  |  |
