| Rationale/ Summary | High leverage teaching practices are evidence-based practices that reliably increase student learning when applied in the classroom. Students will be introduced to each of the practices, what they look like in the classroom and how they impact student learning. | High leverage teaching practices are evidence-based practices that reliably increase student learning when applied in the classroom.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Read each of the following practices below used by a teacher. Based on what you know, rate each as an effective practice or not an effective practice and share your reasoning. T: Let’s look at your bellringer activity.  How did you decide on whether the practice description was effective or not?  S: (Answers will vary.) I thought about what we have already learned in this class and personal experiences that I had with learning in previous classes.  T: While it is important to think about your own personal examples of how you learn best, there is a lot of research that can be shared about what teaching practices can be most effective in the classroom. | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Notes:  High Leverage Strategies  T: Find the notes section on your Student Guide.  S: (Locate notes section on Student Guide.)  T: Have you ever experienced a time where you learned a different way than everyone else?   S: (Share 1 to 2 examples.)  T:  While everyone at times can feel like they learn differently, research tells us that there are some teaching practices that work better than others for all students. .  T:  High leverage teaching practices are evidence-based practices that reliably increase student learning when applied in the classroom. What does it mean to be “evidence-based”?  S: The practices have been researched and tested?  T: Evidence-based practices are not just based on a theory. They have been rigorously tested and have shown to make a positive difference in learning.    T:  The practices that we will focus on for our work in this unit will be: Focus on Instructional Outcomes Structuring Lessons Explicit Teaching Worked Examples Collaborative Learning Multiple Exposures Questioning  Metacognitive Strategies Differentiated Instruction T:  Providing feedback is also on the list of high leverage strategies, but since we have already learned about feedback in previous units, we will not include it here. | PPT Student Guide |
| 10mins | High Leverage Teaching Practices Exploration  T: Today, we are going to explore some high leverage teaching practices. You will start in groups where you will learn to be an “expert” around a topic .  T: After you work with your “expert” group, you will share you learning with the class.  T: (Create nine groups of students with at least two students in each group. Assign each group one of the high leverage practices to explore)  T:  You will first read through the passage about your assigned high leverage practice individually.  After reading, you will discuss your learning with your group members and complete the portion of the chart in your student guide for your practice. Your group should be prepared to share your learning with the whole class. You have 5 minutes to read first. (Set 5-minute timer.)  S: (Students read about their assigned practice and complete the portion of the chart with their group members.)  T: Now discuss the practice with your group and prepare to share your learning with the class.  . Use the three categories in your student guide graphic organizer to guide your discussion and preparation. You will have 5 minutes to discuss and complete the chart. (Set 5 minute timer)  S: (Students discuss the practice and prepare to teach their learning group by filling out the table in their student guide.)  T: (Circulate to  groups to support their discussion and preparation.) |  |
| 18 min | High Leverage Strategies-Whole Class Sharing  T: Now that each of you have become experts on your strategy, we are going teach each other what we’ve learned.   Each group will have 1.5 minutes to share their learning with the class. As the group shares, the rest of the class will take notes in their chart about the practice. Let’s start with group 1. (Set timer for 1.5 minutes for each of the groups as they share from practice 1-9.)  Groups present their learning to the whole class as the class takes notes in the student guide. |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Now that you have been introduced to some of these high leverage teaching practices, can you identify any that you have personally experienced in your classes?  S: (Answers will vary.) We used one today. We engaged in collaborative learning during the Jigsaw. We also have used worked examples, explicit teaching and multiple exposures in this class a lot in the past.  T: Can you think of where you have seen these in other classes?  S: (Answers will vary.) We use worked examples and explicit teaching a lot in Math/science classes.   T:  Why is it important for teachers to use high leverage teaching practices?  S:  High leverage teaching practices are research based and tested. They have been proven to increase learning for students over other strategies.  T:  Today’s lesson was an introduction to the strategies. As we continue, you will learn about each practice and  how to use them effectively in the classroom. |  |
