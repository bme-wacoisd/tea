| Indicator | Met/Not Met | Explanation and Suggestions for improvement (if necessary) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assess what’s most important | Not Met | The exit ticket does ask students to know what an inference is and why it is important but it does not show whether students are able to make inferences or not. The summary only asks them to summarize inferences that were found during the lesson |
| Vary question format | Met | The exit ticket includes multiple choice and short answer questions. |
| Vary question rigor | Not Met | The questions are all about remembering things taught during the lesson. The students are not asked to show that they can make an inference. Replace the third question with a short passage and a question that asks students to explain an inference they can make based on the passage in one short sentence. |
| Keep it short and sweet | Not Met | Delete question 3 and replace as indicated above. |
