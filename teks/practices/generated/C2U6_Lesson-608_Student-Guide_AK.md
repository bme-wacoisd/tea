## Student Guide – Answer Key

### Lesson 6.08: Scaffolding a Lesson – Modeling, Part I

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Mr. Pope is introducing his 3rd grade students to cause and effect. He shows an educational music video that explains what cause and effect is and provides a few examples. Mr. Pope then places students in pairs, gives each pair a baggie with scenario cards, and asks them to determine the cause and effect in each scenario. As students worked, he walked around the room to check for understanding. He realized that many of the students were having difficulty, so he decided it was best to bring the students back to provide additional instruction and model how to find the cause and effect in one of the scenarios. During the model, Mr. Pope stopped to ask questions to check for student understanding and allowed students to ask questions for clarification. Evaluate Mr. Pope’s instruction based on the success criteria for effective modeling.

Review Success Criteria
Criteria for successful modeling:

Break down the skill into learnable steps
Visually demonstrate the steps as students watch
Think Aloud - Verbally explain what the student is seeing as you model
Make important connections between the steps
Check for student understanding along the way and re-model steps as necessary
Ensure pacing is just the right speed
Allow opportunities for students to ask questions and get clarification


#### Practice #3 – Role-play

In groups, you are going to role-play a portion of Lesson 2 from the Grade K Skills 1 Unit, pages 21-26.

Each group member will choose a section from the lesson plan to read and model for the group. While the “teacher” is modeling, the other group members will provide feedback on how well the teacher model aligns to the success criteria. At the end of each model, group members will have 2 minutes to share feedback.
Here are the sections you can choose to role-play:

Listening to Environment Noises
Left/Right Discrimination
Finger/Hand Awareness
Draw Vertical Lines on a Vertical Surface



How was the model related to the objective?
Student responses will vary based on the model, but responses should focus on how the model aligned to the language and rigor of the standard

How were the students engaged in learning?
Student responses will vary based on the model, but responses should focus on the students watching a visual demonstration of the skill or concept before moving into practice, checks for understanding, and opportunities to ask questions and get clarification.

What was the teacher’s role?
Student responses will vary based on the model, but responses should focus on the success criteria for successful modeling.


| Criteria for Successful Modeling | Evident in Modeling from the Lesson |
| --- | --- |
| Break down the skill into learnable steps | Met Not Met  Reasoning: Mr. Pope did not model how to find the cause and effect in a scenario. |
| Visually demonstrates the steps as students watch | Met Not Met  Reasoning: Mr. Pope did not model how to find the cause and effect in a scenario at the beginning. Once he realized students were struggling, he brought students back to model. |
| Verbally explain what the student is seeing as you model | Met Not Met  Reasoning: Mr. Pope did not model how to find the cause and effect in a scenario. |
| Make important connections between the steps | Met Not Met  Reasoning: Mr. Pope did not model how to find the cause and effect in a scenario. |
| Check for student understanding along the way and re-model steps as necessary | Met Not Met  Reasoning: Mr. Pope checked for understanding while groups worked and realized students were struggling, so he brought students back together to provide additional instruction and model an example. |
| Ensure pacing is just the right speed | Met Not Met  Reasoning: Mr. Pope could have slowed the pace of the lesson to allow time to model how to find the cause and effect prior to the activity. |
| Allow opportunities for students to ask questions and get clarification | Met Not Met  Reasoning: During the model, Mr. Pope provided time for students to ask questions for clarification. |
