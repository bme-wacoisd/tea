|  | As discussion progresses around effective collegial collaboration, there may be an opportunity for you, as a teacher, to share the ways that collaboration amongst colleagues happens within your school building and ways in which you have benefited the most from collaboration with colleagues. |  |
| 2mins | Bellringer How do you define effective collaboration? In what ways has collaborating with another person helped you to grow or improve in the past? |  |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Debrief T: Turn to a partner and share your response to the bellringer. What similarities do you see in your definitions or experiences? (Set timer for 2 minutes.) S: (Share with a partner.) T: Can someone share any similarities they identified in talking with their partner? (Call on one or two students to share highlights from the discussion.) S: (Responses will vary.) |  |
| 5 min | Notes: Importance of Collegial Collaboration  T: As you noted in your responses to the bellringer today, collaboration can be an important part of growing and improving. As an educator, collegial collaboration, or the cooperative relationship of colleagues working together toward the pursuit of shared goals and outcomes, is a professional expectation as you continue to grow and develop.  T: In fact, both the T-TESS rubric, edTPA, and the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) all include collaboration with other education professionals as a key part of their process or expectations. Why do you think that might be?  S: Teachers get better when they work with other teachers.  T: There are many benefits to collegial collaboration.  Helps to build relationships. As teachers work together, they begin to rely on each other, and you get the sense you are not in it alone. Creates a sense of shared responsibility. In working together, teachers learn that they share the responsibility for student learning and can work to share the burdens as well. Strengthens each other. As teachers work together, they learn to effectively leverage the strengths that each bring to achieve their goals. Increases knowledge. Teachers who collaborate can share best practices and learn from others’ experiences and knowledge. Increases student achievement. Many research studies have shown that students had higher achievement gains in schools with strong collaborative environments.  T: Think back to your bellringer and the experiences that you shared at the beginning of the lesson. How did you see any of these benefits result from your collaboration experience?  S: (Responses will vary.) | Include image of Dimension 4.3 TTESS in Slides Include image of National Board 5 core Propositions in slide |
| 10 min | Notes: Common Practices for Collegial Collaboration  T: Now that we know about why collaboration is important, let’s talk about ways that collegial collaboration often occurs in a school building. In your student guide, you have five common strategies or practices listed that promote collaboration in a school. Turn to a partner and see if you can work together to match the strategy or practice with its appropriate description. You will have 5 minutes to work together. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S: (Work with partner to match strategies to descriptions.)  T: Now let’s check our answers. (Display ppt slide with answers.)  How did working with a partner make you more successful at this task?  S: There were some descriptions that were very close. We were able to discuss together our thinking and use prior knowledge that we had to best match the descriptions.  T: Do you think task would’ve been harder to do alone?    S: (Responses will vary.)  T: Let’s talk through these examples to provide additional clarification.  Professional learning communities are a common collaborative group within schools. A PLC is often teachers who teach the same subject. This team works together to collect and analyze student data with the purpose of determining how effective instruction was and what can be done to support learners who did not master the content. Based on this description how does a PLC differ from common planning time?  S: Grade level teams looks like it is a group of teachers who don’t necessarily teach the same thing.  T: Grade level teams are a group of teachers who share a similar set of students. An example might be an 8th grade team of middle school teachers who teach different subjects but share the same students. These teachers gather at a common time to focus on coordinating common practices, procedures, activities, and more for the group of students. How are grade level teams and PLC’s different from critical friend groups?  S: Critical friend groups are voluntary groups, and they utilize protocols and a coach to focus on improving practices.  T: The key to critical friends’ groups is that they are a group of teachers that come together to learn from and with each other. Their interactions are structured with specific protocols that facilitate reflection and discussion. Sometimes coaches help to facilitate the learning and the discussion.   T: Peer observations and co-teaching are both left. They are a little different because they don’t necessarily involve teams, but rather are two teachers who collaborate.  How are peer observations different from co-teaching?  S: Peer observations are one teacher visiting another’s classroom to learn by watching the instruction. With co-teaching, two teachers work together to teach the same group of students in the same classroom.  T: In peer observations the purpose is from one teacher to learn from another. In co-teaching, the teachers are working together to plan, instruct, and assess the same group of students. |  |
| 15 mins | Practice: Collaboration Scenarios  T: In just a minute, you are going to get a chance to practice what it feels like to collaborate with colleagues in a scenario role play. Please locate the scenarios provided on your student guide under the section titled “Practice: Collaboration Scenarios.”    S: (Locate the collaboration scenarios in the student guide.)  T: We are going to work in groups of 3-4 to role play these scenarios. (Arrange students into groups of 3-4). Half of the groups will role play scenario 1 and the other half will role play scenario 2. (Assign scenarios to groups). Each scenario will pose a question or a problem that might need to be addressed through collegial collaboration. As you work as a team to design a solution or address the challenge, I want you to think about what type of collegial collaboration you might be engaging in and what the benefit would be of this collaboration. You will role play for about 5 minutes and then you will work as a group to reflect on that experience by completing the reflection questions on your student guide below the scenarios. Remember, during this time you are going to take on the role of the teacher so be sure to work to exhibit professional communication and behavior. What questions do you have for me?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T:  I will keep time and let you know when you should transition to the reflection questions. You may begin now. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S: (Engage in role play scenarios.)  T: Time is up for the role play. Now you will have about 7-8 minutes to complete the reflection questions as a group that are found below the scenarios on your student guide. (Set timer for 7 minutes.)  S: (Complete reflection questions.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: How did it feel to collaborate in the scenario? Were you able to identify some solutions or next steps to address the scenario problem? (Call on 1-2 groups to share thoughts.)  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: Did you experience any benefits from this collaboration in terms of addressing the scenario problem?  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: What are some of the other benefits that we identified as the result of collegial collaboration?  S: (Responses may vary but should include: Helps to build relationships, Creates a sense of shared responsibility, Strengthens each other, Increases knowledge, Increases student achievement)  T: Did anyone experience any challenges? If so, what were they?  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: During the scenario role play you experienced collaboration as a grade level team and a PLC. What are the other three types of collegial collaboration we discussed today?  S: Peer observation, Co-teaching, and Critical friends’ groups |  |
