| Dance Move | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tip Toes | A teacher stands for a moment on her tiptoes while looking out at the room, as if she’s just making doubly sure everything is okay in some hard-to-see spot in the room. |
| The Politician | A teacher sends a message of “I see you all out there” when you gesture briefly to the different folks in the audience who are demonstrating that they are with you. |
| The Quarterback | A teacher crouches to confer with a scholar and flashes their eyes briefly across the room, to make sure they see the classroom. |
| The Sprinkler | A teacher starts her Swivel across the classroom, but at one point, snaps back a few degrees in the direction she’d just scanned to intimate, “Oh, I think I just saw something I shouldn’t ha... No. Everything is okay.” It makes your scan a bit less predictable, which is generally good. |
| Invisible Column | A teacher moves his head slightly to the side after giving a direction as if he's trying to look around an invisible column to make sure his students are doing as they should. |
| Disco Finger | A teacher traces the track of her gaze in a Swivel with her finger outstretched, pointer style. It intimates, “Let me just check all of these places” and makes the Swivel obvious to those who are less likely to notice it. |
