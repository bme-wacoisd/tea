Describe a scenario where a teacher, coach, etc. provided the same daily directions for a routine in January that they did in September. What was your response? How did this make you feel?
Answers will vary.



Scenario: Mrs. Smith’s Classroom System
Ms. Smith greets her line at the door by telling them where to sit on the rainbow-colored carpet. “Orange, orange, orange, orange, green, green, green, green, blue, blue, blue, blue,” she says in an upbeat voice.
She scans the seated students and says, “Remember scholars, as you find your seat on the carpet, your folder goes in your lap.”
Ms. Smith returns reminding students where to sit. “Green, green, blue, blue, blue.”
Then she turns her attention back to the class again, “Thank you, Jenna, for going directly to your seat without getting side-tracked. Thank you, Sydney, for passing purple to get to the green squares. Oh, I love how Nia is in the middle of the square with her folder in her lap. She looks like a third grader. Oh, Jimena looks like a third grader, too. Ans so does Caroline!”
Mrs. Smith walks to the front of the carpet and gives her students a bright smile. “I have a challenge!” she sings to them.
“Bring it on!” they respond.
Mrs. Smith continues, “Scholars I want us to be so loud and proud that the classroom across the hall can hear us.” The students beam.
Mrs. Smith signs again, “I’ve got a problem,” and the students respond, “I can solve it!”
Mrs. Smith reads from the easel: “Our problem today says, “Davina needs $65 to buy her mom a gift. She only has $28, and she earns $21 for doing chores.” She reads the problem and then says. “What are the two questions you’re asking yourself to help you solve this problem? Turn to your partner with your hands in your lap in five, four, three, two, one…Talk.”

What did you notice about the teacher’s interactions with the students?
Interactions were joyful and orderly.
How much time was spent on academic content versus classroom systems and giving directions?
38 words of the 177 words spoken were directly related to academic content.
Is this the ratio of academic content to classroom systems and directions you would expect in March? Why or why not?
This ratio might be appropriate in the first few days or weeks of the school year, but by March the teacher should not focus as much attention on classroom systems.


Notes: Systems Cues
Key Term:
Define the key term below.
Components of a Good System Cue
- Reminds students in the fewest possible words, both respecting their existing knowledge of the system and preserving their focus on the content.
- Might reflect a classroom value. One teacher may ask for student attention by saying “eyes” to reflect the priority she places on eye contact. Another teacher may choose to bring the class to attention by clapping out a beat, reflecting the priority he places on joy and movement.
- Always uses the same cues at the same points in the system to prevent student confusion and reinforce the efficient and autonomous execution of the system.


Video Notes
While watching “Remove Scaffolding: Eric Snider,” record the cues you see Mr. Snider using.
“Mark your text”
“Long hair to short hair”
“Snap, snap”
“Gallencia track”
“Eyes back in”


What did you notice about the amount of time spent on academic content vs. classroom systems? How does this compare to the transcripts from Ms. Smith’s class that you read earlier?
Students in Mr. Sniders class had significantly more time to focus on academic content compared to Ms. Smith’s class.


How did the use of System Cues benefit the students in Mr. Snider’s class?
More student autonomy and increased learning time.


Planning Your System Cue
Adapted from Texas TLAC Online
Read the planning document silently and note how the teacher moved from explicit directions to a System Cue.
One Additional Note: Some teachers find it helpful to plan and deliver a mini-roll-out when they introduce their Systems Cue so that students know exactly what to expect. The mini-roll-out is an opportunity to remind students of your pride in their autonomy and their ownership of the system.
For the system of eye contact planned in the chart above, the mini-roll-out could sound like this:
“Scholars, you’ve done such a wonderful job with making eye contact when I call for attention that you barely need a reminder now. Instead of counting down, I am going to start saying, “Eyes,” and then scanning to see that you are pausing in your work and making eye contact with me. So, listen for my signal.

What do you notice about the transition from explicit directions and narration to a Systems Cue?
The directions become simpler and allow students to take ownership of the system. The Systems Cue still indicates what the students are expected to do (“eyes” is a command for eye contact) but makes instructions more succinct and saves time.


| System Cue | An abbreviated direction that reminds students of the steps in a system that they already know. |
| --- | --- |


| Explicit Visible Directions (Weeks 1-2) | Directions with Fewer Words (Weeks 2-3) | System Cue (Week 4 and beyond) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “I’m going to count down from 3 and then I want every student to pause what they are doing, put their pencil in the groove, and make eye contact with me. Here we go. Eyes on me in 3, 2, 1.” | “Thank you, class. Get ready to come together. Eyes on me in 3, 3, 2.” | “Eyes.” |
