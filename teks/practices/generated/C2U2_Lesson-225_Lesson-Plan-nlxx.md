| TEKS | 7 | The student creates an effective learning environment. The student is expected to:  describe and implement a safe and effective learning environment that incorporates the principles of universal design;  demonstrate teacher and trainer characteristics that promote an effective learning environment; identify classroom management techniques that promote an effective learning environment; | The student creates an effective learning environment.

| Rationale/ Summary | Positive reinforcement is an important tool to build student morale and motivation. Positive reinforcement communicates to students that they’ve been successful and should continue to do more of that behavior. Some teachers use a more structured approach to motivate and reward students for following expectations. This type of behavior management system is a reinforcement-based system that acknowledges and rewards students for positive behaviors. | Positive reinforcement is an important tool to build student morale and motivation.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Based on what you’ve learned so far, what are the essential components of a classroom behavior system?   What were common elements you noticed in the different reward systems you explored?  How did the components of those systems compare to the essential components we identified?  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Based on what you’ve learned so far, what are the essential components of a classroom behavior system?

| 5 mins | Bellringer: What are different ways your previous or current teachers have rewarded behavior and/or efforts in class? Did they use a reward system where you could earn points or prizes? What do you feel worked well? What were some of the drawbacks? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Turn and Talk: T: Take a minute to share your experiences with a partner. (Provide time for students to share with a partner using a routine of your choice – turn and talk, think-pair-share, stand up – hands up – pair up, etc.). S: (Share with a partner.)  T: (Transition to a whole group discussion and ask for a few volunteers to share.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Intro to Classroom Reward Systems T: (Provide the following definitions via PPT. Students can record notes in the 2.25 Student Guide.)   One type of behavior management system is a reinforcement-based system that acknowledges and rewards students for positive behaviors. As we learned in our lessons on Radar, students are more likely to behave appropriately when teachers reinforce the behavior.   A classroom reward system is a system where students work individually or as a group to earn tangible rewards by exhibiting targeted behaviors, which are behaviors that a teacher has explicitly taught students.  Classroom reward systems provide extrinsic motivation for students, which can improve student behavior. On the other hand, students who are intrinsically motivated do not always prefer classroom reward systems. In addition, classroom reward systems can be troublesome when they become competitive or when students’ negative behaviors/consequences are exhibited for everyone to see.   Classroom reward systems can take many forms, such as:  Sticker charts Clip charts Token or Dollars Point system Computer-based behavior systems  Computer-based behavior systems provide a way for teachers to reinforce positive behavior and reward students using a website or app. Many of these computer-based apps allow parents to track students’ daily activity in real-time. Some students prefer tangible rewards and may not respond to the intangible rewards in a computer-based behavior system.  Components of a Classroom Behavior Management System T: Whether a teacher decides to use a sticker chart or a computer-based behavior system, a classroom behavior management system consists of the following components:  Purpose –Students should understand that a positive system creates an organized, consistent, culturally-responsive, and integrated classroom environment that supports effective instruction and promotes student learning. A positive system also engages and communicates with students (and families) in an ongoing manner. By understanding the purpose, students and families are more likely to fully engage in the system.   Commitment – Teachers and Students must commit to supporting and implementing the system consistently and with fidelity. All partners will work together to create and maintain safe and supportive learning environment.  Defines behavioral expectations, procedures, and consequences – Students need to be explicitly taught the classroom expectations and procedures and the consequences of not following through with those expectations and procedures.  Fair – Teachers must ensure fairness in the system. A system will backfire and is potentially harmful if students view it as unfair.  Individual or Group Rewards – The teacher must decide is the system will focus only on students earning individual rewards for their own good behavior, or target group rewards where the whole class is rewarded for good behavior. There may also be a combination of the two.  Type of rewards – Teachers must decide the type of rewards they will over, such as stickers, trip to the treasure chest, tokens, points, etc. The teacher must also decide if those rewards can be added up and later traded for a larger reward, such as a small prize or activity.  Acknowledge and reward positive behaviors – The teacher must immediately reward students for their positive behavior to reinforce the desired behaviors. The desired behavior will occur more frequently if it is immediately followed by positive reinforcement.  Keeps parents informed – Parents must be made aware of the expected behaviors, the classroom reward system, and routinely informed about student behaviors.

| 15 mins | Practice 1: Analyze Classroom Reward Systems T: In groups of 3-4, you will explore various classroom reward systems and computer-based behavior management systems. Choose two different behavior management systems and describe the different components of each on the 2.25 Student Guide.   S: (Complete task in Student Guide.)  T: To close out the lesson: you will reflect and respond to the following questions: How did the components of each system compare to the list we discussed earlier? (responses will vary) What were the strengths of each system? (responses will vary) What were the potential drawbacks? (responses will vary)  S: (Capture reflection in the Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Would a volunteer like to share the reward systems your group discussed?  S: (Share out from group discussion.)  T: Why is it important to have a classroom reward system in place?  S: Reward systems are a form of positive feedback, which increase the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated. |  |
