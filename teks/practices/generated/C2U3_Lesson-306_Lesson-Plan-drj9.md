### Lesson 3.06: Asset-Based Practices and High Expectations

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:
In the last lesson we were introduced to the idea of asset-based and deficit-based teaching. Define each idea and describe why asset-based thinking about students can help student learning.

Asset-based thinking is when the teacher focused on what students can do.
Deficit-based thinking is when the teacher focuses on what student cannot do.

Asset-based teaching helps build students confidence and develop their mindset that, with effort, they can achieve the learning goals in the classroom.





























High Expectations: Examples and Non-Examples












High Expectations: Independent Practice
In the scenarios below, determine if the teacher is holding high expectations for all students and explain why they are or are not.

Scenario A:  A teacher requires that all her students correct every math problem they got wrong on a quiz, explain their mistakes or misunderstanding, and turn that in as an assignment after the quiz.
This is teacher is holding high expectations because she is asking students to correct their work and do it again with an analysis of why they got it wrong. She is showing that she believes they can get it right.
Scenario B:  A teacher praises a set of students who always get “A”s on their essays because they are “naturally gifted writers,” while saying nothing about the students who are not yet writing excellent essays.
This teacher is not holding high-expectations for the students who are not yet writing excellent essays. When she says some students are “naturally gifted,” she is not praising effort, but instead something unchangeable in the students. The teacher could potentially be sending the signal that some students are not capable of writing excellent essays and is not explaining what can be done to improve.
Scenario C:  A teacher praises a set of students who always get “A”s on their essays and describes the elements that make their essays strong, and she describes for all students what they can to do to make their essays meet the standards. She indicates that by the end of the year, all students who apply these skills can be writing excellent essays.
This teacher is holding high expectations. She believes every student can become an excellent essayist and she describes what it takes to grow as an essay writer.

### Lesson 3.06: Asset-Based Practices and High Expectations

Name:
Date:
For each scenario, determine whether the teacher is holding high-expectations.

Scenario #1:  A teacher conducts a lesson calling only on the students that raise their hands. A few students sit quietly in the back doodling on their notebook and not putting forward much effort.
The teacher is not holding high expectations. All students can and should be involved in class discussion and putting forth their best effort.
Scenario #2:  A teacher does not accept answer that are close to correct but instead ask students to explain their thinking and use accurate and precise language to get the fully correct answer.
The teacher is holding high-expectations. They are asking the students to explain their thinking and get to the correct their answers.
Scenario #3:  Students in an 8th grade math class need to learn about Algebra skills. Many of them also struggle with fractions. The teacher finds ways to offer the students who are struggling with fractions additional chances to practice and get feedback on that skill in their homework while she continues to teach all students the Algebra skills required in 8th grade math.
The teacher is holding high expectations. Even though some students have some unfinished learning about fractions, she gives them additional opportunities to practice and learn the missing skill.
Scenario #4:  A high school student tells her teacher that she is having relationship troubles with her boyfriend and that it is causing her to be very distracted and that is why she hasn’t been doing her homework. The teacher listens sympathetically, suggests she see the counselor, and then the two of them create a plan for how she will get caught up on her homework and start to get it done on time moving forward.
The teacher is holding high expectations. She is developing a strong, trusting relationship with the student and helping problem-solve to ensure that the student continues learning and putting forth the effort she needs to do to learn despite the challenges in her life.

Describe why holding high expectations for all students is important.
Holding high expectations ensure that you help students achieve at their highest level and that you don’t allow students not to do their very best.

Describe why it is important for students to develop a growth mindset and believe that effort can lead to learning?
Students who believe that effort leads to learning are more likely to put in the effort it takes to learn.
Why is it important to ask students to do their work again when they haven’t put forward their best effort?
You are reinforcing the value of effort and your belief that students can learn the content by making them do it again correctly.

| 10 mins | High-Expectations in Action T: Please take 2 minutes to share your definitions of asset-based and deficit-based teaching from the bellringer with a partner.  S: (Student share with partners).  T: Yesterday we learned that the mindset that an educator brings to their classroom is important. A teacher’s dispositions toward students turn into actions. If a teacher believes that students can do challenging work, they will make sure students are exposed to challenging, grade-level content and will design supports and instruction to help them succeed. We often call this holding high expectations for students.  T: Today we will learn about three important components of holding high academic expectations for students. Helping reinforce a growth mindset, emphasizing effort, and asking students to do it again. Adapted from 13 Ways to Set High Expectations in the Classroom in 2023 (Drews, 2022 and Dweck, 2015)  T: A growth mindset stresses that intelligence isn’t fixed in place but that it can change and grow with effort.  As a teacher you will say and do things that show a belief in students’ ability to grow with hard work and effort.   T: Why do you think this is important?  S: Because students who believe they can grow with effort are more likely to do the work to grow.  T: Right – why would you as a teacher not want to reinforce the idea that some students are simply good at certain things and others are not?  That intelligence is fixed?  S: Students might not try hard and might not actually learn if they think intelligence is just fixed and can’t be changed.  T: Right. If you believe you can grow, you are more likely to stick with things until you get them. If you as a teacher show students that you believe they can grow and learn, you are reinforcing your high expectations for them.  T: One of the main ways you can help students is to encourage effort as opposed to simply rewarding getting a right answer.   Here, you may want to personalize this by providing an example of a student in your past who used significant effort to achieve and learn.   T: Why might a teacher want to encourage effort?  S: Because applying yourself can lead to learning.  T: Right – as a teacher, the most I can ask of you is that you do your absolute best. And if you do that, you are doing what you need to do to learn.   T: Lastly, if you hold high expectations, you need to make sure that you help students truly learn the content. Part of this is asking student to do it again when they haven’t got it right or when they haven’t given their best effort. Students can improve if they are asked to do their work again or think deeper about a question or problem. That is part of the learning and process and part of holding high expectations. | Student Guide PPT |
| 15 min | High Expectations: Examples and Non-examples  T: To help us understand high expectations, let’s explore some examples and non-examples of how teachers can reinforce high expectations.  T: Please turn in your student guide to the examples and non-examples section.  T: (Do the first few together to help students understand the concepts and ask them to record their answers in the student guide. After doing a few examples, you can either break them into groups to complete the work or have them work independently.)  T: (After completing examples and non-examples, review, discuss and correct.)  S: (Students record correct answers in student guides) | Student Guide PPT |

| Teacher Action | Example or Non-Example? | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A teacher says, “I am so proud of you class. When we started this unit, we had a hard time with fractions, but we worked hard, did lots of problems, and we now are getting really good at this!” | Example | The teacher is narrating how hard work and practice led to understanding. |
| (When a student tries but gets the wrong answer)  That is a good try – even though that isn’t exactly right – you will get it with more practice! Now let’s think about why that isn’t correct… | Example | Even though the student got the answer wrong, the teacher reinforces that the student will eventually learn it and returns to examine the problem. |
| (When a student gets the right answer)  Great job! You are so smart! | Non-example | The teacher’s response sends the message that learning is more about being smart than it is about applying yourself. |
| (When a student gets the right answer)  That is correct! I appreciate all the time and work you’ve put in to learning this!  Can you explain how you got that answer? | Example | The teacher emphasizes the effort that led to the correct answer. |
| A teacher asks students to explain how they improved their essay from their first draft to their final version and how they used feedback to make changes. | Example | The teacher is having students show how the process of taking feedback and using it makes for a better essay which demonstrates how effort leads to improvement. |
| A student says, “I am just no good at math!”  The teacher says, “That’s okay. Some people are naturally good at math, and some aren’t. I am not really a math person myself.” | Non-example | The teacher is not holding high expectations nor reinforcing that math can be learned through effort. |
| A student says, “I am just no good at math!”  The teacher says, “I understand you are frustrated. That is part of the process. You just don’t understand this yet. Now, let’s look the problem…” | Example | The teacher uses the phrasing that the students doesn’t understand this yet – indicating they are capable and then returns to the problem. |
| The teacher uses a tracking tool in the classroom that shows how students master topics over time – moving from not knowing to knowing. | Example | Students see how their learning and skill grow with the time, effort, and practice. |
| After a student is called on and doesn’t immediately know the right answer, the teacher uses questioning in the classroom to help the student go from a misunderstanding to an understanding of the content. | Example | The teacher helps guide the student to the correct answer by not accepting an incorrect answer and having the students think through the problem to get it right. |
| A teacher calls on a student. When the student doesn’t know they right answer immediately, the teacher moves on to another student right away. | Non-example | This can teach the student that they don’t really have to pay attention or give their best effort in class. |
| A teacher requires students to return to their quizzes and correct the answer they got wrong and explain their reasoning. | Example | The teacher is showing that analyzing what you got wrong can help you grow in your understanding and is reinforcing that the skills required on the test are learnable. |
| A teacher puts a “C” grade at the top of the essay with no indication how it could be improved. | Non-example | The student has no way to understand what steps they could take to improve the quality of their essay. |
| A teacher puts a “C” grade at the top of the essay and uses a red pen to mark up places where the essay could be strengthened and improved with specific changes. | Example | The teacher holds the student to high expectations for the quality of work they can produce and provides specific thoughts on how it could improve. |
