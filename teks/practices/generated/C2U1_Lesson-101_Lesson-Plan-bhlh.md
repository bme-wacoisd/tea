| Rationale/ Summary | Establishing clear systems and routines is a proactive approach to classroom management. When students understand what is expected of them and systems and routines are clear and consistent, classroom distractions are minimized and attention on learning is maximized. In this lesson, students will begin to make connections between systems and routines and strong classroom culture while also introducing themselves to their classmates. | Establishing clear systems and routines is a proactive approach to classroom management.

|  | Prior to this first class, consider the systems and routines you would like to develop in your classroom. For this lesson, you will need a routine for the following activities:  Student entry into the class Opening of class Transition from independent/group work to next activity Whole class discussion |  |
|  | Familiarize yourself with the Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up routine for partner discussions. | Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up |
|  | Begin the first class by modeling a typical routine for beginning class effectively by: standing at the doorway to greet and welcome students upon entry,  directing students to a preferred seating arrangement utilizing a seating chart (seating chart should be projected on a screen for students to see. Alternatively, consider using sticky notes on desks to help student locate their assigned seat),  direct them to complete the bellringer, and completing an attendance record while students complete the bellringer. |  |
|  | Plan for how students will obtain their copy of the Student Guide and the supplies needed for the Bellringer. Consider setting them on each desk or directing students to take them from a table as they enter the room. |  |
|  | Complete the bellringer and place at the front of the room as an example for students to follow. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: What’s in a Name?  Create a table tent that displays for your name for your teacher and classmates to see. Follow these instructions: Fold the stock paper on your desk hotdog style to create a table tent.  On the outside, write your preferred name. Write it large and in a bright color so your teacher and classmates can see it.  On the inside, write a story about your name.  (If needed, explain that this story might be about your given name, your preferred name, or your nickname. You might have a story about your first name or your last name or maybe even your middle name. Your story might be a story of family and history or a story about how your friends came to call you by a nickname. Tell any story you’d like about how you came to be called by your name.)  T: (As students complete the bellringer, circulate to each desk to determine each student’s preferred name. Document accordingly in the appropriate classroom records.) | Student Guide Stock Paper (one piece per student) Markers (at least one per student) |
| 15 mins | Notes: Systems and Routines  T: (Greet students at the door. Welcome them, ask them to find their assigned seat, and complete their bellringer. Display these instructions on the board as well.)    T: (Give a personal introduction to the class, including name and other information as desired.)  T: In our class community, we will have a few systems and routines that we use to create a safe and effective learning community. During class, you should follow along in your Student Guide. After the bellringer, you’ll see a chart where there is space for you to fill in some definitions.   T: The first one is systems and routines. Systems and routines are clear and consistent structures in a classroom that help students execute recurring activities correctly and efficiently.  S: (Add definition to chart in Student Guide.)  T: It’s important to have systems and routines because they help us have a positive classroom culture. Classroom culture is the environment and tone of a classroom that impacts how students feel during instruction. Classroom culture includes clear and consistent routines, as well as a sense of safety and belonging for all students.  S: (Add definition to chart in Student Guide.)  T: When you arrived in the classroom today, I greeted you at the door, asked you to find your seat, and complete the bellringer. This is one routine we will use every day. Notice that the instructions were short, clear, and also written on the board. This is to make them easy to follow and remember. When everyone knows what to do, it helps create a safe and effective classroom environment.   T: Please participate in the discussion by raising your hand and waiting to be called on.   T: I gave two instructions for how to participate in the discussion. What were they?  S: Raise your hand. Wait to be called on.  T: I made the instructions short and clear on purpose so that you can easily follow them.   T: Let’s discuss the system and routine we used to start class today. Why do you think I stood at the door and greeted you as you arrived? Why might it be important to greet students at the door?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T:  Greeting students at the door makes them feel welcome and safe in the classroom. This helps create a positive environment. You knew where to sit because I had a seating chart displayed. Why would a teacher use a seating chart?  S: (Answers will vary.)   T: (Call on several students for responses).   T: A seating chart creates a safe environment—when students know what to do and where to go, they feel more at ease. It creates an effective environment—less time spent finding a seat means more time for learning. Finally, it builds a positive class culture—students have a physical space in the class where they belong. It also helps the class to learn each other’s names.  T:  This class will always start with a bellringer. A bellringer is a focusing task for students to complete at the beginning of class.  S: (Add definition to chart in Student Guide.)  T: Why would I ask you to complete a bellringer at the start of class?  S: To get us to focus on our work for the day.  T: The bellringer helps create a safe and effective learning environment. Students feel safe when they know what is expected of them. Bellringers also add to an effective environment because they maximize time on task. Time on task is the amount of class time spent in active learning.  This bellringer asked you to write about your name. To create a safe and effective classroom culture, it’s important that the teacher learns the students’ preferred names and how to pronounce them correctly.  S: (Add definition to chart in Student Guide.)  T: (Hold up example bellringer.)  T:  I completed this bellringer myself to: Model for you how to fully complete the bellringer Share something with you about me and my name. In the first few days of class, it’s important for the teacher to learn about students and for students to learn about the teacher. This helps build a positive classroom culture.  T: When I demonstrate how to complete a task it is  called modeling. Modeling is an instructional strategy during which the teacher demonstrates a new skill or behavior for students.  S: (Add definition to chart in Student Guide.)  T: What are some systems and routines for the beginning of class that help create a safe and effective learning environment?  S: Greeting students at the door, seating charts, bellringers.  T: Next, we’re going to learn about another routine we will use in class when we work in pairs. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Partner Routine: Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up T: When you are going to work in pairs to complete a task or share your answers, we’ll use the routine Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up.  T: First, I’ll ask you to stand up. Then, I’ll ask you to put your hand up. Put up one hand, either your left or your right. Last, I’ll ask you to pair up. You’ll keep your hand up until you find a classmate with their hand still up. When you find someone, give them a “high five.” The two of you are partners, so you can put your hands down.  T: I need a volunteer to help model this activity.  T: (Select volunteer.)  T: (Complete Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up with student volunteer.)  T: Now, you’re going to try. Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up!  S: (Complete Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up.)  T: (Circulate and correct students as they use the routine.)  T: Nice work. |  |
| 5 mins | Practice: Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up T: We’re now going to Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up, but, this time, take your name tent with you. Once you find your partner, you should each share your name and what you wrote about your name. Let’s go!  S: (Complete Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up and share their name and accompanying information with partner.]  T: [Use process for transitioning students from independent/group work to the next activity.]  T: We’re going to do that one more time. This time, find a different partner than the one you just had. Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up!  S: (Complete Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up and share their name and story behind their name with partner.]  T: [Use process for transitioning students from independent work to the next activity.] |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Every day, we will have a debrief to review what we learned. After the debrief, everyone will complete an exit ticket to show what you’ve learned.   T: What are some systems and routines we use in class?  S: Bellringer, seating charts, raising hands for group discussion, stand up-hands up.  T: How do the systems and routines help create a safe and effective classroom environment?  S: Students understand expectations, students know what to do and how to participate in class, it helps the teacher and students learn about each other, it leads to more time on task. |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
