| Objectives | Describe the characteristics of effective classroom rules Analyze examples of classroom rules  Develop a set of classroom rules that meet the given success criteria | Describe the characteristics of effective classroom rules Analyze examples of classroom rules  Develop a set of classroom rules that meet the given success criteria | Describe the characteristics of effective classroom rules Analyze examples of classroom rules  Develop a set of classroom rules that meet the given success criteria |
| Rationale/ Summary | In this lesson, students will explore the characteristics of effective classroom rules and analyze and revise rules to ensure effectiveness. A dependable system of rules and procedures provides structure for students. This structure helps students to be engaged with instructional tasks and communicates to students that the teacher cares for them. | In this lesson, students will explore the characteristics of effective classroom rules and analyze and revise rules to ensure effectiveness.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Consider the set of rules shown (in the Student Guide) for a 2nd grade classroom. Is this an effective set of classroom rules based on the success criteria? Provide and explain 3 reasons from the success criteria to justify your response. Use specific examples from the rules in your justification. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Consider the set of rules shown (in the Student Guide) for a 2nd grade classroom.

| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Create a list of at least five classroom rules you have seen or heard before. What was effective or not effective about those rules and why? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Introduction to Classroom Rules T: (Call on several students to read examples of their rules. Create a class list of 5–10 examples.)  S: Turn and talk to discuss the following questions:   T: How do rules and procedures impact a teacher's ability to implement instruction?   S: They help a teacher keep order and have a predictable classroom. A predictable classroom helps ensure smooth transitions.  T: How do rules and procedures impact the overall classroom environment?  S: Rules and procedures help maintain fairness and keep everyone safe. A fair classroom helps students build relationships with the teacher and among each other. A safe classroom helps students focus on and engage in learning  T:  Are there some rules that are better than others? What makes a classroom rule effective?  S: Answers will vary.  Notes on Classroom Rules T: Rules may be different depending on the grade level and subject area. Rules also reflect the values and culture of the classroom. These guidelines can help teachers develop effective classroom rules. ((Display the 2.10 PPT and direct students to take notes in the Student Guide. Cold call on students to read each guideline and follow each guideline with a discussion.)  S: (Volunteers read guidelines and all students record in their student guides.)  Classroom rules are written expectations for behavior in a classroom. Rules are few in number, always apply, and must be understood by the intended age group.  They must be explicitly taught and modeled They must be implemented in a way that is FIRM, FAIR, and CONSISTENT  T: (Elaborate on the guidelines using the PPT and follow-up questions.)  T: Rules should be limited to between 3–5 in number. Why do you think it is important to have no more than 5 rules?  S: It makes them easier to remember and follow.  T: Rules should be understandable. What does it mean for a rule to be understandable?  S: The language should be simple and clear so the students know what to expect.  T: Rules should be easy to monitor, or observable. What does it mean for a rule to be observable?  S: The teacher should be able to see students following or not following the rule.  T: Rules should be stated positively when it makes sense to do so. Why should teachers try to frame the rule positively?  S: Too many negatively-worded rules communicate a harsh classroom culture.  T: Rules should address the most important expectations for students.  Why should teachers only have rules for the most important expectations?  S: Rules about unimportant things are hard to remember and won’t be taken seriously by students.  T: You will now review several sets of classroom rules to see if they meet the criteria. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Examples and Non-Examples Example:  T: Take a few minutes to review the first set of classroom rules. (Give students time to read the rules independently.) S: (Review classroom rules.) T: How does this list meet the guidelines for effective classroom rules? S: It includes 3–5 rules. The rules are appropriate and understandable for the age group. The rules are easy to monitor and hold students accountable (they are framed as observable behaviors). They are all stated positively. They address important expectations for a class.  Non-Example T:  You will now look at a set that does not meet the success criteria. (Give students time to read the rules independently.) T: Why don’t these rules meet the success criteria? S:  There are too many rules. Rules 6, 7, and 9 are worded negatively. Rules 1 and 8 are difficult to observe or manage. Rule 5 does not address an important behavioral expectation. (Record their responses on the 2.10 Student Guide.) T: How can we make these rules meet the success criteria? We can add, delete, or change language or whole rules. (Take suggestions from students for how to fix the rules.) S: (Volunteer ways to make the rules better.) T: Now that we have a new list, let’s hear from a few other students who haven’t shared yet. How does this new list meet the success criteria? (Call on students who did not share suggestions for revision.) S: Answers will vary based on the new list of rules. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 2: Upgrade the Bellringer T: Reread the list on the board from the beginning of class. (Allow students time to work in pairs or small groups to analyze the list on the board based upon the success criteria.)   T: Do the rules meet the success criteria? If not, how can they be upgraded to meet the criteria? Have a conversation with the person sitting next to  you – on your right if you are in an even row, on your left if you are in an odd row – to discuss and revise these rules.   T: (Circulate through the room as students work to upgrade the list from the board. Check for and provide feedback on students’ understanding of how the rules meet or do not meet the criteria.) |  |
| 5 mins | Practice 3: Design Your Own Classroom Rules T: As teachers, you will need to establish general rules for their classrooms. Find a new partner and draft a list of grade-appropriate classroom rules. To find your new partner, stand up, hands up, and pair up.  S: (Stand up and find a new partner. Begin analyzing and revising the rules.)   T: Now that you have your revisions, find another pair to provide feedback  based on the feedback rubric in your student guide. Work together as a whole group to make revisions as necessary. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Look at the list of rules from the beginning of class and compare it to the rules you developed. What changed? What is the impact of having more effective classroom rules? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
