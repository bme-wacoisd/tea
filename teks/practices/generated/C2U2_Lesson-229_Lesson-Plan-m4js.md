| 5 mins | Bellringer: Use the Picture Metaphors Protocol to respond to the following prompt: As we conclude this unit of study, describe how you currently feel about classroom management. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Classroom Discussion:  T: Which picture did you all select? Let’s have some volunteers share.   S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Presentation Instructions: T: Today you will all share a component of your Classroom Management Plan with the entire class. As you present your chosen individual component, be sure to use behavior management techniques that we have discussed throughout this course (e.g., Pastore’s Perch, Radar, Be Seen Looking, etc.). T: In your Student Guide you will find a chart titled “Presentation Feedback Notes.” Locate that for me now, please.  S: (Turn in Student Guide to Presentation Feedback Notes.)  T: While your classmates are presenting, write down the things you noticed and the things you still wonder about from their presentation. After each person presents, we will provide warm and cool feedback based on what we noticed and wondered. |  |
| 25 mins | Presentations: Classroom Management Plan S: (Individually, students will present a component of their Classroom Management Plans. Students who are not presenting will provide peer feedback following each presentation using the following frames found in their Student Guides: I noticed... I wonder...) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Thank you all for sharing components of your Classroom Management Plans! I hope the feedback you received from your peers throughout the course of the development of the plans proved helpful as you thought more about classroom rules and routines, layout, behavior management, and the development of positive relationships with students. Given what you’ve learned, why is a classroom management plan an important tool for teachers? How can it lead to a smooth implementation of classroom management strategies?  S: Responses will vary, but may include: A classroom management plan is important because it Clearly outlines routines, rules, and scripts for the teacher to use with the class to establish a strong classroom environment that promotes student learning Is a helpful document that teachers can return to when they need to reestablish or revisit a specific routine, rule, or procedure with the class A classroom management plan can lead to a smooth implementation of classroom management strategies by Providing the teacher with a solid foundation for routines, rules, and other procedures regarding classroom layout, behavior management, and positive relationships Ensuring that teachers are intentional about building positive relationships with students and have a plan to make that happen—these positive relationships will build trust and rapport with students, which will hopefully lead to fewer behavior issues in the classroom |  |
