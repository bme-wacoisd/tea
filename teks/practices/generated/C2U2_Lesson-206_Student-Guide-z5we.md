Bellringer:
Describe a time when your behavior was corrected by a parent or teacher. What did they say or do? Did their correction work? Why or why not?






Intro to Positive Framing
As you watch, “Frame Redirections Positively: Hilary Lewis”, consider the following: How does Hilary maintain students’ privacy and communicate her belief that students want to be successful, even as she delivers a redirection?



Notes on Six Rules of Positive Framing

List the six rules of Positive Framing










Notes on Assume the Best

List the elements of an effective Assume the Best





Practice 1: Study the example and upgrade the nonexample.
List “go-to-phrases” for Assume the Best. Discuss as a class how this list aligns with the success criteria for Assume the Best.






Upgrade the nonexample.
Look at two statements below that do not meet the success criteria. Work with a partner to identify how the statements do not meet the success criteria and adjust the statements to improve them.


Practice 2: Analyze Assume the Best in action.

As you watch “Frame Redirections Positively: Gillian Cartwright,” look for evidence of Gillian’s Economy of Language and Emotional Constancy and consider how Gillian assumed the best intentions. Record your evidence below.



Practice 3: Creating effective Assume the Best statements.

Plan and deliver an Assume the Best redirection with a partner using the following scenario from Texas TLAC Online. As your partner delivers their Assume the Best statement, use the feedback rubric below to provide specific feedback to your partner on their alignment to the success criteria.


Scenario: Students are solving math problems. You’ve asked them to show their work, but you notice that a few students are skipping right to jotting the solution.







Feedback Rubric



| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Student Excitement |  |
| Student Forgetting |  |
| Teacher Clarity |  |
| Student Confusion |  |


| Statement | Revision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “Fourth grade, none of us should be trying to sneak ahead of the rest of the class.” |  |  |
| “Tina, please wait to answer until Jeffrey decides to join us.” |  |  |


|  | Still Working On It. Provide Suggestions for Improvement. | You got it! Provide Evidence. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attributes behavior to positive intent: When students are making a good-faith effort, avoids ascribing ill intention to what could be the result of distraction or genuine misunderstanding. |  |  |
| Is specific about what you want students to do: Holds students accountable for following through by ensuring they know exactly what they should be doing. |  |  |
| Economy of Language: Use as few words as possible to lead the class through the Do It Again so their focus stays on the content and your Do It Again doesn’t turn into a lecture. |  |  |
| Maintains Emotional Constancy: Use a neutral tone and facial expression when delivering redirections of any kind. |  |  |
