Date:


| Scenario | Strategy | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mr. M. wants to get a sense of what his class understands about a topic before a lesson, but he also wants to hear potential misconceptions. What informal assessment strategy might he use? | Think-Pair-Share or Four Corners | Both activities will provide an opportunity for Mr. M. not only to identify student answers to questions, but also to hear the thinking behind their answers. Hearing their reasoning will allow him to identify any misconceptions. |
| In the middle of his lesson, Mr. M. wants to get a sense of how overloaded his students might be and whether they are ready for the next step of the lesson which will introduce new content. What informal assessment strategy might he use? | Thumbs up, down, sideways | Thumbs up, down, sideways will allow Mr. M. to get a sense of how many students are ready to move on. If too many students are feeling partially or completely confused, he might want to slow down his pacing to avoid overload. |
| Mr. M. is creating groups for an activity. He wants to be sure he creates strategic groups with at least one student in each group who feels confident in their understanding and can even help others who may still need support. What informal assessment strategy might he use? | Fist to five | Mr. M. can use student responses to divide students, ensuring that each group has one student who indicated a 4 or above. |
