### Exit Ticket

- Review the roll-out speech below. Complete the chart on your Exit Ticket.
- “Today is the first time that we’re going to do a lab experiment. You are going to become the scientists and test out the things we’ve been learning in class. It’s not about what you read in the textbook anymore; it’s about what you prove yourself through experiments. If you’re interested in going into a science career, today is even more exciting. Experiments are how scientists discover new knowledge.
- In the lab, safety is incredibly important. Because these are real experiments, we need to be cautious and follow strict safety protocols. First, we’re going to focus on the routine we will use to get ready for lab. As I call your row, you’ll first head to the cabinet and pick up a pair of gloves. Don’t put them on just yet! You’ll then walk to the cabinet and get your lab coat.  Just hold on to it. You’ll then stop at the station on the counter and pick up a pair of safety goggles. You will then go to your assigned lab station and put on the goggles, gloves, and lab coat. Once you’ve put on all three, raise your hand in the air. When I see everyone with a hand in the air, I’ll know that you’re ready to begin the experiment.”
