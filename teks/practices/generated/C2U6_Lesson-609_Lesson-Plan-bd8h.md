| Rationale/ Summary | In the Science of Learning unit, we learned that the working memory has limited capacities which can become overwhelmed by tasks that are too cognitively demanding. By providing a step-by-step model of how to perform a task or solve a problem, a teacher helps avoid cognitive overload. In this lesson, students will learn the purpose of modeling and identify the criteria for successful modeling. Students will use the success criteria analyze examples and nonexamples of modeling in a lesson. | In the Science of Learning unit, we learned that the working memory has limited capacities which can become overwhelmed by tasks that are too cognitively demanding.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will read a scenario to determine whether it meets the characteristics of effective modeling. If the criteria are not met, provide a suggestion for improvement.  Students will respond to the following question: How does teacher modeling help build student understanding and mastery of the standard?

| 4 mins | Bellringer:  Look at each lesson example and determine if it is an example of the “I do,” “We do,” or “You do” portion of the lesson. Write if it is “I do,” “we do,” or “you do” beside the example number. | Student Guide |
| 1 min | T: (Review correct responses.)  T: How did you determine if each lesson clip was an example of “I do,” “we do,” or “you do”?  S: I thought about what the task was asking the student to do vs what the teacher was doing.  T: What is it important for a lesson to include these components?  S: It helps ensure that the cognitive load gradually shifts from the teacher to the student. It allows learners to take in, process, and learn information in small increments and in a logical order. It allows learners to build on their prior knowledge and provides the right amount of scaffolding needed to build understanding toward mastery. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Intro to Modeling a Lesson  T: In our previous lesson, we discussed how a lesson should be intentionally structured to build student understanding using a gradual release of responsibility framework, such as “I do, we do, you do.”  (Share image via PPT.)   T: Today, we are going to discuss a key component of the “I do” stage of the gradual release framework, which is where the teacher provides explicit instruction, demonstrates, and models the learning for the students.   S: (Take notes in student guide.)  T: Modeling is an instructional strategy where the teacher demonstrates how to perform a skill while describing each step with a rationale.  T: Modeling allows students to see how to perform each step of a process as well as understand why each step is important.   T: Modeling also reduces a student’s cognitive burden. Why is it important to avoid overload? S: Too much information at once or tasks that are too cognitively demanding can interfere with learning.  T: Yes – Students have a limited working memory capacity which can become overwhelmed by tasks that are too cognitively demanding. By providing a step-by-step demonstration of how to perform a task or solve a problem, a teacher helps avoid cognitive overload.   Success Criteria  T: Let’s look at the criteria for successful modeling. When modeling a concept or skill, a teacher must:  Break down the skill into learnable steps. Visually demonstrate the steps as students watch. Think Aloud = Verbally explain what the student is seeing as you model Make important connections between the steps. Check for student understanding along the way and re-model steps, as necessary. Ensure pacing is just the right speed. Allow opportunities for students to ask questions and get clarification.   T: It is also important to note that the modeling must align to the language and rigor of the objective to ensure students are focused on the most important content expected for the lesson and the content that will be assessed in the future. This is why it is essential that the objective align to the standards for the grade-level. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Practice #1 – Video Example of Modeling  T: Let’s look at an example of modeling in a 2nd grade math class to find evidence of successful modeling based on the criteria we just discussed. (Direct students to where they will record evidence in their student guides)  According to the success criteria, what will we be looking for?  S: (Name the success criteria from their student guides.)  T: As you watch, record evidence of the success criteria and consider how the model is related to the objective, how the students are engaged in learning, and what the teacher’s role is.  T:(Start video at 17:05 and end at 21:40.)  S: (Watch video example and record evidence in student guide.)  T: How does this model align to the success criteria? (Guide student discussion based on answers in 6.8 Student Guide – Answer Key.) | Video Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lHi5hQwbWuIhCER7G3hNn8DHZkA-zwGO/view?usp=sharing (Start at 17:05 - End at 21:40) |
| 20 mins | Practice #2 - Nonexample of Modeling  T: Use the following script to model a nonexample. Pay close attention to the directions for how you are to deliver the lesson. As you model, students will evaluate your delivery based on the success criteria.   T: Now, let’s look at a nonexample of modeling. I am going to deliver a lesson while you all play the role as second grade students in my class. As we go through the lesson, evaluate my delivery based on the success criteria for modeling and record your notes in the student guide.  T: (read the script below) | Lesson Source Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Why is this a nonexample of modeling?  S: You did not break down the concept of how to use different combinations of coins to make a dollar into learnable steps. You did not visually demonstrate the steps as students watched. Since there wasn’t a visual demonstration, you could not make important connections between the steps. You moved through the lesson at a fast pace and didn’t allow opportunities for us to ask questions and get clarification.   T: What could I have done differently to support student understanding before moving into the practice activity?  S: You could have visually shown students how to use different coin combinations to make a dollar while doing a think aloud to explain the process. This would have allowed an opportunity for you to make connections between the steps in the process. You could have gone at a slower pace and allowed time for students to ask questions and get clarification.   T: How does modeling help build student understanding?  S: Teacher modeling helps build student understanding by scaffolding the concepts and skills into learnable steps. Modeling allows students to see how to perform each step of a process as well as understand the connections between each step and why each step is important. Modeling also communicates what a successful outcome looks like, and the importance of the concept being taught. |  |
