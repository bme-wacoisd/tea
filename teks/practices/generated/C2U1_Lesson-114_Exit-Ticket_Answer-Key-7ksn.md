### Lesson 1.14: Rolling Out Systems and Routines

Name:
Date:
Imagine you are talking to a brand-new teacher a few days before the first day of school. What would you tell this teacher about the importance of implementing systems and routines in his/her classroom?
Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom. For systems and routines to work, teachers must get student buy-in. One way to increase student buy-in is to help students own the systems and routines. Careful attention to the roll-out of a routine or system can increase student ownership.
What tips would you provide about how to get it right in the first weeks of school?
When you roll-out a system or routine, make sure that students know why they are doing it. You should model and describe the routine for the students. Students need opportunities to practice the system or routine. For practice time to be effective, the teacher needs to model and describe the routine at the beginning of the practice. The teacher should pre-empt pitfalls and make sure that students practice in small steps. The teacher should also scan the room and provide feedback to students.
