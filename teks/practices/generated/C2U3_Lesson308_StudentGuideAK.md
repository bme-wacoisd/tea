## Student Guide – Answer Key

### Lesson 3.08: Leveraging School Community to Support Instruction

Name:

Bellringer:
How do relationships with trusted adults help students in school? When students have a trusted adult, they are more likely to confide in someone when they are  struggling, know that someone will celebrate their accomplishments, and will feel less lonely when dealing with issues where they need support.
Outside of your immediate family, who is the adult in your life do you trust the most? Why do you trust them? Answers will vary.


Introduction to School Community Support Roles

#### Practice: Ms. L / Joslyn


Ms. L is a first-year teacher. Over the course of the first few weeks of school, she gets to know her students and learns a lot about them. She is struggling to connect with Joslyn, who often seems uninterested in class. Joslyn confided in Ms. L that she is periodically homeless and often goes without food. When she comes to school, she is hungry and falls asleep during class. Students make fun of her because of her appearance. She often comes to school with dirty or ripped clothes. She said that the only class she enjoys is art class. When she arrives to school in the mornings she frequently stops by the library to exchange books. Ms. L wants to know how to better engage Joslyn and help her become successful. With whom should Ms. L arrange meetings? Why?
Guidance counselor, social worker, art teacher, librarian, previous teachers (if applicable). The guidance counselor and social worker may not be able to give confidential information, but Ms. L can discuss her concerns about food insecurity and get insight into strategies to help Joslyn while she is in class. Additionally, she can reach out to the art teacher, librarian, and previous teachers to find out more about her favorite types of art, books, and perhaps friends she engaged with in the previous classes. Then Ms. L can use this information to help engage Joslyn in conversations or incorporating some of her preferred art/reading samples in her lessons.

#### Practice: Scenario Analysis

Read the scenarios below. Who might each teacher go to in the school to get support? What questions might the teacher ask each of their colleagues?

Scenario 1: Janie is a student in Ms. M’s 5th grade history class. Janie maintained good grades through most of elementary school but now that school is getting more complicated, she is beginning to struggle. She often forgets to turn in her homework and her notebook is a mess. She is disorganized and can never find her notes or handouts. She often forgets to take information home to her parents and she doesn’t do well on history tests or quizzes. Ms. M hears that Janie is doing well in her science class. She also knows that Janie has a study period with a math enhancement teacher, and is doing well in math class. Who can Ms. M go to for help and what questions might she ask?
Science and Math Teachers:
- How do you support Janie in science?
- Does Janie struggle with organization in your class? If not, what are you doing to help keep her organized?
- Does Janie do well on your tests and quizzes? If so, what strategies does she use to study in your class?
Math Enhancement Teacher:
- What do you know about Janie that might help me provide her more support in history?
- What kinds of study skills does she learn in math enhancement that I can leverage in my class to help her do better?

Scenario 2: Eduardo is a student in Mr. O’s math class. Mr. O has noticed that he does very well solving independent math problems, but he struggles when it comes to word problems. He isn’t always able to identify the most important information and he gets confused in setting up number representations based on the word problems. Since English was not Eduardo’s primary language, he used to receive services through an ELL teacher. Recently he has graduated from that program and is no longer receiving those services in school, but still seems close to his former ELL teacher. He enjoys playing baseball after school but is not on the baseball team.  Who can Mr. O go to for help?
ELA teacher
- How is Eduardo’s reading? Do you notice that he struggles with comprehension?
- How do you help Eduardo with his reading? How can I apply these same strategies in my math class?
- What are some strategies to help students identify the most important information in a text?
- What are some reading strategies that I can use with Eduardo?

ELL Teacher
- Are there any ways I can better design word problems to support Eduardo’s understanding?
- How can I help Eduardo with literacy?
- What are some strategies for teaching literacy in a math class?
PE Teacher
- I have noticed Eduardo is often playing sports after school. How is he doing in PE?
- Are there strategies you use to engage him in class or content I can use that might interest him?



| Role | Responsibilities and Awareness of Students |
| --- | --- |
| Counselors | Support students’ emotional needs, can provide support for social situations, may know career goals |
| Resource Teachers | Teachers such as ELL Teachers, Special Education Teachers, Reading/Literacy Specialists, Math Specialists who provide strategies for teaching different populations or specific content areas. |
| Social Worker | Support students outside of school with family and community, can provide mental health services |
| Previous Teachers | Can inform on student’s strengths and opportunities for growth, successful strategies, seating arrangements, hobbies, interests, performance on tests and assignments, grouping preferences. Current teachers have a responsibility to use an asset-based mindset when learning about a student. If the previous teacher did not have a positive relationship with the student, the current teacher should consider that when collecting information |
| Enrichment Teachers | In many schools, the art, music, pe teachers, and librarians have known and taught the students for years. They are an excellent resource for knowledge of students. |
| After-School Teachers/Coaches | Another good resource for classroom teachers to learn about student personalities, talent, and interests. Collaborating with them can help teachers find more ways to motivate students. |
