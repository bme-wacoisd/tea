## Exit Ticket - Answer Key

### Lesson 5.06: Strategic Questioning Continued

Name:
Date:
Mr. M. is teaching a lesson about creating claims based on evidence. His goal for the day is that his students will be able to create a claim based on evidence in a text and then collaborate with peers to refine their claims.
- Review the lesson goal and the pre-planned questions. For each question, determine what information the teacher can learn and what their next steps might be.
Adapted from: https://reading.amplify.com/educator/resources/pdf/v1/mCLASS/G2_Claim_and_Evidence_(Literary).pdf

- Evaluate the question set as a whole. Does the question set meet the characteristics of effective questions? Explain your reasoning.
The questions do increase in complexity throughout most of the lesson. They begin with what and move to why and then how. The do not meet the level of thinking aligned to the learning target because students are never asked to create their own claims and they are not asked to work with a partner to revise their claims.



| Activity | Planned Questions | Purpose of the Question (what the teacher can learn) | Teacher’s next steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bellringer: Students will read a short paragraph that includes a claim supported by evidence. Students will circle the claim and underline the supporting evidence. | What is the claim?  What evidence does the author use to support his/her claim? | The teacher will learn whether students are familiar with the idea of claims and evidence. | The teacher may need to fill in gaps if students don’t know what claims and evidence are. |
| The teacher will engage students in a whole group read aloud of Jack and the Beanstalk. | Why is Jack’s mother worried?  Why do Jack and his mother decide to sell the cow?  Why does Jack take the beans?  What happened to the beans overnight? | The teacher will learn whether the students understand the basic story. | The teacher may need to provide additional support for students who struggle with the story. They may need remediation in comprehension skills but also during the claims/reasoning activity they may need a simple summary of the story. |
| The teacher will share statements about the text and will ask students to agree or disagree. | Jack made a good choice when he traded his cow for five beans. Do you agree or disagree?  How can you support your opinion with evidence from the text? | The teacher will learn whether students can find and use evidence to support claims. | If students do not understand how to find or use evidence the teacher may need to slow down the lesson to fill in the gaps. |
| The teacher will provide a new statement and ask students to agree or disagree individually. Students will work on their own to find evidence to support their reasoning. | Do you agree or disagree?  How can you support your opinion with evidence from the text? | The teacher will learn whether each individual student can find and use evidence to support claims. | The teacher can use this information to create strategic groups for remediation, enrichment, or reteaching the next day. |
