Practice 1: Lesson Analysis



## Practice 2: Planning for Collaborative Group Work

Based on the scenarios below, plan for effective facilitation of group work. Each partner will take the lead on planning for one scenario while the other partner acts as a “Rally Coach” to show support.
Scenario 1
Ms. Westbrook’s ELA class is engaging in book circle discussions. Each group will choose a different book to read. After finishing each chapter, the small group will have a group discussion. During the discussion, they will discuss new vocabulary they encountered in the chapter. They will also discuss how the characters have developed in the chapter, how the author has used literary devices in the chapter, and how the conflict is deepening or resolving. Ms. Westbrook wants to be sure all students participate in the discussion and every student.


Scenario 2
Students in Mr. Morrison’s 1st grade science class are designing protective coverings to protect scientists’ arms and legs when they are exploring the plants at the edge of a pond. Students will imagine a solution, test, and record information about various materials, and come to a final solution about their protective covering. At the end of the project, they will present their process and solution to the rest of the class.

| Collaborative Learning | Educational approach where groups are used to enhance learning through working together. |
| --- | --- |
| Why is Collaborative Learning a High Impact Teaching Strategy? | Collaborative learning develops higher-level thinking, verbal communication, self-management, and leadership skills. Collaborative learning exposes students to an increase in understanding of different perspectives. |
| Five key practices for structuring collaborative learning | Ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary to accomplish the task. |
| Five key practices for structuring collaborative learning | Vary the size and membership of the group according to the activity’s purpose and individual learning goals. Groups are most effective when they range in size from 3-5 participants. |
| Five key practices for structuring collaborative learning | Use structures such as group roles, norms, and explicit time keeping, to ensure that students share the responsibility and ownership of outcomes. |
| Five key practices for structuring collaborative learning | Provide opportunities for regular feedback on group processes as well as student/group self-evaluation. |
| Five key practices for structuring collaborative learning | Be clear about expectations and instructions for the task. |


|  | Met/Not Met | Suggestions for Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary to accomplish the task. | Not met. Task does not take more than one person. | Decrease number of participants in the group and add time constraints or other elements that make it impossible for one person to complete the task alone. |
| Vary the size and membership of the group according to the activity’s purpose and individual learning goals. Groups are most effective when they range in size from 3-5 participants. | Not met. The group is not more than 5 but there are more students in the group than needed to reach the learning goal. | Decrease number of participants in the group. Maybe also pair students intentionally based on strengths. |
| Use structures such as group roles, norms, and explicit time keeping, ensuring that students share the responsibility and ownership of outcomes. | Not met. Group roles were not used and there were no time constraints or norms included. | Add group roles. Add norms. Facilitate one step at a time and provide clear time limits for each step. |
| Provide opportunities for regular feedback on group processes as well as student/group self-evaluation. | Not met. There is no option for reflection or feedback in the instructions. | Teacher should circulate to provide feedback to pairs. Activity should end with a debrief during which students can reflect on how they worked with their partner. |
| Be clear about expectations and instructions for the task. | Not met. The instructions were not given in order. Too many were provided at once, and they were vague. | Provide a specific instruction for the first step only at first. Add instructions as students move through the activity. |


|  | How will you plan to meet each criterion based on the scenario? Answers will vary throughout and may be like the following: |
| --- | --- |
| Ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary to accomplish the task. | What about the task requires collaboration?  A group discussion cannot be completed individually. Ms. Westbrook could ask each student to share their initial thinking about the chapter and then at least one way their ideas changed after discussing with the group to ensure that group discussion was required. |
| Vary the size and membership of the group according to the activity’s purpose and individual learning goals. Groups are most effective when they range in size from 3-5 participants. | What size group would you use and why?  I would include 4 students in each group because there are 4 topics to discuss after each chapter. Each student can take the lead on one topic. How will you use individual learning goals to help you determine membership of each group? Students can be assigned group roles based on their strengths so that they take a leadership role to help their peers. |
| Use structures such as group roles, norms, and explicit time keeping, to ensure that students share the responsibility and ownership of outcomes. | What group roles might you use?  Vocabulary Finder, Character Expert, Literary Device Finder, and Plot Developer What norms might you include?  A different group member will lead each section of the discussion.  Group members should each come to the discussion with at least 3 questions about their topic already prepared.  Each person in the group should contribute at least once to the discussion about each topic. How would you break the task into timed chunks?  Each topic gets 7 minutes of time for discussion. I would set a timer and tell students when to shift to the next topic. |
| Provide opportunities for regular feedback on group processes as well as student/group self-evaluation. | How will you provide feedback to the group?  I would tell individual groups what they are doing well and on what they could improve. I would also share trends with the whole class after each discussion so groups can set goals for improvement. How will you plan for reflection based on group processes? After each chapter groups will discuss what they did well, whether they met their group’s goals for improvement and what they can continue to do better. |


|  | How will you plan to meet each criterion based on the scenario? Answers will vary throughout but may be like the following: |
| --- | --- |
| Ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary to accomplish the task. | What about the task requires collaboration?  Designing something new can be challenging and having partners to bounce your ideas off can make for a stronger final product. |
| Vary the size and membership of the group according to the activity’s purpose and individual learning goals. Groups are most effective when they range in size from 3-5 participants. | What size group would you use and why?  I would use groups of 3. Too many students would lead to some students not having anything to do to contribute and too few students wouldn’t provide opportunity for multiple perspectives to make the design stronger.  How will you use individual learning goals to help you determine membership of each group? Students with strong knowledge of the process of design (imagine, test, revise) as well as the process of experimenting should be the group leader or designer. Students who might need additional support learning can learn from the leader. |
| Use structures such as group roles, norms, and explicit time keeping, ensuring that students share the responsibility and ownership of outcomes. | What group roles might you use?  Designer, Recorder, Reporter What norms might you include?  The designer should share ideas out loud and ask the recorder and reporter for their opinion before moving forward with the idea.  All students stick to their role and complete the parts of the task assigned to their role.  Be sure everyone agrees before changing the design. Use the data to make good decisions. How would you break the task into timed chunks?  The first chunk would be imagining a design. I would set a timer for 10 minutes for students to imagine together.  The next chunk would be testing. Students would have 15 minutes to test 3 materials.  The final chunk would be revisions and getting ready for the presentation. Students would have 10 minutes. |
| Provide opportunities for regular feedback on group processes as well as student/group self-evaluation. | How will you provide feedback to the group?  I would tell individual groups what they are doing well and what they could improve on. I would also share trends with the whole class after each discussion so groups can set goals for improvement. How will you plan for reflection based on group processes? Between each section of the activity, students could identify one thing their group did well and one thing they can improve on in the next section. |
