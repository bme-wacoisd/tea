Name:

Bellringer:
In the last lesson we were introduced to the idea of asset-based and deficit-based teaching.  Define each idea and describe why asset-based thinking about students can help student learning.

Asset-based thinking is when the teacher focused on what students can do.
Deficit-based thinking is when the teacher focuses on what student cannot do.

Asset-based teaching helps build students confidence and develop their mindset that, with effort, they can achieve the learning goals in the classroom.

High Expectations: Examples and Non-Examples


High Expectations: Independent Practice
In the scenarios below, determine if the teacher is holding high expectations for all students and explain why they are or are not.

Scenario A:  A teacher requires that all her students correct every math problem they got wrong on a quiz, explain their mistakes or misunderstanding, and turn that in as an assignment after the quiz.
This is teacher is holding high expectations because she is asking students to correct their work and do it again with an analysis of why they got it wrong.  She is showing that she believes they can get it right.
Scenario B:  A teacher praises a set of students who always get “A”s on their essays because they are “naturally gifted writers”, while saying nothing about the students who are not yet writing excellent essays.
This teacher is not holding high-expectations for the students who are not yet writing excellent essays. When she says some students are “naturally gifted”, she is not praising effort, but instead something unchangeable in the students. The teacher could potentially be sending the signal that some students are not capable of writing excellent essays and is not explaining what can be done to improve.
Scenario C:  A teacher praises a set of students who always get “A”s on their essays and describes the elements that make their essays strong, and she describes for all students what they can to do to make their essays meet the standards. She indicates that by the end of the year, all students who apply these skills can be writing excellent essays.
This teacher is holding high expectations.  She believes every student can become an excellent essayist and she describes what it takes to grow as an essay writer.














| Teacher Action | Example or Non-Example? | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A teacher says, “I am so proud of you class. When we started this unit, we had a hard time with fractions, but we worked hard, did lots of problems, and we now are getting really good at this!” | Example | The teacher is narrating how hard work and practice led to understanding. |
| (When a student tries but gets the wrong answer)  That is a good try – even though that isn’t exactly right – you will get it with more practice! Now let’s think about why that isn’t correct… | Example | Even though the student got the answer wrong, the teacher reinforces that the student will eventually learn it and returns to examine the problem. |
| (When a student gets the right answer)  Great job! You are so smart! | Non-example | The teacher’s response sends the message that learning is more about being smart than it is about applying yourself. |
| (When a student gets the right answer)  That is correct!  I appreciate all the time and work you’ve put in to learning this!  Can you explain how you got that answer? | Example | The teacher emphasizes the effort that led to the correct answer. |
| A teacher asks students to explain how they improved their essay from their first draft to their final version and how they used feedback to make changes. | Example | The teacher is having students show how the process of taking feedback and using it makes for a better essay which demonstrates how effort leads to improvement. |
| A student says, “I am just no good at math!”  The teacher says, “That’s okay. Some people are naturally good at math, and some aren’t. I am not really a math person myself.” | Non-example | The teacher is not holding high expectations nor reinforcing that math can be learned through effort. |
| A student says, “I am just no good at math!”  The teacher says, “I understand you are frustrated. That is part of the process. You just don’t understand this yet. Now, let’s look the problem…” | Example | The teacher uses the phrasing that the students doesn’t understand this yet – indicating they are capable and then returns to the problem. |
| The teacher uses a tracking tool in the classroom that shows how students master topics over time – moving from not knowing to knowing. | Example | Students see how their learning and skill grow with the time, effort, and practice. |
| After a student is called on and doesn’t immediately know the right answer, the teacher uses questioning in the classroom to help the student go from a misunderstanding to an understanding of the content. | Example | The teacher helps guide the student to the correct answer by not accepting an incorrect answer and having the students think through the problem to get it right. |
| A teacher calls on a student. When the student doesn’t know they right answer immediately, the teacher moves on to another student right away. | Non-example | This can teach the student that they don’t really have to pay attention or give their best effort in class. |
| A teacher requires students to return to their quizzes and correct the answer they got wrong and explain their reasoning. | Example | The teacher is showing that analyzing what you got wrong can help you grow in your understanding and is reinforcing that the skills required on the test are learnable. |
| A teacher puts a “C” grade at the top of the essay with no indication how it could be improved. | Non-example | The student has no way to understand what steps they could take to improve the quality of their essay. |
| A teacher puts a “C” grade at the top of the essay and uses a red pen to mark up places where the essay could be strengthened and improved with specific changes. | Example | The teacher holds the student to high expectations for the quality of work they can produce and provides specific thoughts on how it could improve. |
