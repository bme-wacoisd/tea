When was a time a teacher contacted your parent? What did they talk about? (If you can’t think of one, share an instance in which it may have been beneficial if a teacher had done so.)
Responses will vary.
List 4 scenarios in which a teacher may need to contact a parent.
Reponses will vary.

Notes: Family Communication Methods
In the space below, brainstorm ways a teacher can communicate with parents and family.
- Home visits
- Weekly emails/updates
- Call
- Text
- Email
- Family Open House
- Classroom engagement/Family communication apps (like ClassDojo)
- Attending School and Community Events
How can teachers identify the preferred method of contact for parents and families?
Teachers can use a beginning of the year survey, reach out to the student’s previous teachers, or call to introduce themselves early in the year and find out what parents prefer.
Parent Communication Success Criteria
- Respect time and preferred method of contact: Consider what requires a meeting, call, email, or text.
- Plan ahead: Ensure you have everything in place to have a productive meeting. This can include planning questions, preparing student work examples, arranging an interpreter, as needed.
- Develop a relationship with the parent/caregiver
- Acknowledge that you both want the best for the student and seek out ways to collaborate to support their success.
- Demonstrate professional behavior and language.
- Listen actively and empathetically; avoid judgement.

#### Practice 1: Communication Role Play


Read the scenario below and complete the table to plan for the parent meeting. Be prepared to role play this meeting with a partner.
Frankie works hard during Math class but could use a little extra support with understanding fractions. You decide to contact his parents to let them know that the school offers after school tutoring sessions twice a week and that Frankie may benefit from this additional practice. English is not the primary language spoken at home, and Frankie recently mentioned that he does not have consistent internet access at home.




Tracking Communication with Families
An important best practice is keeping a log of all family communication. Consider the following example of a family communication tracking log.


Practice 2: Family Communication Tracking Log
Read the scenarios below and use the information to complete the Family Communication Tracking Log.
Scenario #1:
Stephanie has historically been a good student, but recently has had issues staying awake in class.  Knowing that her mom prefers to communicate by email, you send her a message explaining the situation. Her mom responded the next day and shared that their family recently welcomed a new baby sister, which has thrown off Stephanie’s bedtime routine. She commits to ensuring Stephanie goes to bed at a consistent time. You respond thanking her for the context and share that you can also provide Stephanie with opportunities to get a drink of water or to walk around to help her stay awake.



Scenario #2:
Bryan has been late to class the last few days despite your efforts to get him to get to class on time. You see Bryan’s grandma at the basketball game and share his recent tardiness. She thanks you for letting her know and promises it will not happen anymore. She said she will speak with him about it after the game and provided her work phone number in case you need to contact her about this again. You agree to give her a call the next week if the issue continues.



| Question | Response |
| --- | --- |
| What method of communication would you choose? | Phone call or home visit. |
| How would you prepare for this parent meeting? | Frankie’s family does not speak English at home, so I would need to arrange for an interpreter. They do not have internet access (so no email). Have student work ready to show where he needs help. |
| What do you want the parent to know when they leave the meeting? | Frankie is a hard worker but is struggling with fractions. There are tutoring options available to support him. |
| What do you want to know from the parent? | Can Frankie attend these sessions? How else can we support Frankie in finding success in math? |
| How will you work to build the relationship? | Responses will vary. |
