Notes on Five Keys for Effective Nonverbals

Practice: Nonverbals in Action
Choose one of the five keys to focus on as you watch Doug's analysis of Nonverbals in Ms. Willey's & Ms. Hinton's third-grade classes.  Take notes on your identified key as you watch.



| Redirection | Changing the course or direction of one’s actions |
| --- | --- |
| Intervention | Steps to help one improve in their area of need |
| Least Invasive Intervention | Redirecting an undesired behavior with minimal disruption |
| Nonverbal Interventions | Gestures, silently modeling a desired behavior, facial expressions, eye contact, etc. that reinforce expectations, manage classroom transitions, and keep group discussions productive |
| Emotional Constancy | Maintaining a calm demeanor by managing tone and body language |
| Reinforce | A response to behavior that increases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated |


| Key Element | Description | Evidence from Juliana Video |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reinforce Expectations You Already Taught | Nonverbals are useful for reinforcing expectations you've already taught. If you try to use a Nonverbal to "teach" an expectation, you're likely to confuse students. |  |
| Redirect Early | Address students’ off-task behavior sooner, rather than later. This allows you to step in with a smaller redirection. Once a behavior is “major,” it is very hard to correct it nonverbally. |  |
| Deliver Nonverbals While Teaching | Continue instruction per usual, circulating throughout the room as you teach. This ensures that the task of learning continues for the class while you redirect behavior as needed. |  |
| Communicate the Solution | Show students exactly what they need to do to adjust their behavior as opposed to focusing on what they should stop doing. Make clear gestures (e.g., reminding a student to take notes by pretending to write) and model where appropriate (e.g., communicating to a student to sit up by modeling strong posture yourself) |  |
| Model Emotional Constancy | Nonverbals can carry an emotional valence, whether positive, neutral, or negative. A harsh, hands-down gesture delivered with a scowl amplifies rather than minimizes invasiveness. Strive to deliver your Nonverbal Interventions neutrally or with a touch of warmth. |  |
