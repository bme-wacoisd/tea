| Rationale/ Summary | Strong Voice is a technique for adjusting your speech and body language to ensure students listen carefully to what you say.  Teachers can establish formal register by adjusting their speech and body language to signal that what they are saying is important.  "Register" describes the tenor of your communication with others. Effective teachers modulate register purposefully to maximize student attention.  Highly effective teachers understand the impact of register on their students and move between the casual, formal, and urgent registers with intentionality. | Strong Voice is a technique for adjusting your speech and body language to ensure students listen carefully to what you say.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will read each scenario and determine the appropriate communication register:  casual, formal, or urgent. Scenario 1: Formal Scenario 2: Casual Scenario 3: Urgent  Describe a time and place in which each of the three communication registers:  casual, formal, and urgent might be used in the classroom.

|  | Prior to the start of this lesson, ensure you can access the following Vimeo Videos:  Establish Formal Register: Hilary Lewis Establish Formal Register: Ijeoma Duru Establish Formal Register: Emily Bisso |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:    Consider the following scenarios in a 5th grade classroom. Ms. K stands upright at the front of the classroom. Speaking in a calm, low voice, she says, “Pass in your papers.”   Ms. J sits at her desk in the corner of the room. Uses a high-pitched fast voice, she yells, “Pass in your papers!”  How would you expect the students to react to each teacher? Based only on this scenario, what conclusions do you make about the culture in each classroom? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Bellringer Discussion T: (Call on a few students to share and elaborate upon their responses.):   T: How would you feel in each of the scenarios?   S: Scenario 1: confident, comfortable / Scenario 2: anxious  T: What would you assume to be true about the teacher in each of the scenarios?   S: The teacher in scenario 1 is engaged with the students and expects them to have completed work / the teacher in scenario 2 doesn’t care about the students and may be stressed out.  T: Have you been in classrooms like scenario 2? What has been your reaction?   S: Answers will vary  T: What do you assume to be true about the culture in each classroom?   S: Scenario 1 – the classroom culture is safe and comfortable / scenario 2 – the classroom culture is anxious; students may feel disconnected. | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Intro to Strong Voice T: Strong Voice is a technique for adjusting your speech and body language to ensure students listen carefully to what you say. “Register" describes the tenor of your communication with others.  Effective teachers modulate register purposefully in order to maximize student attention.    In today’s lesson, we’ll learn about Formal Register, one of the key aspects of Strong Voice.   Practice 1: Analyze Strong Voice in Action T: (Show the video “Establish Formal Register: Hilary Lewis.”)  T: As we watch TLAC Team Member Hilary Lewis deliver directions, consider what aspects of Hilary's delivery enhance the clarity of her directions. Record your thinking in the student guide.  S: (Record observations in the 2.4 Student Guide.)   T: What aspects of Hilary's delivery enhance the clarity of her directions? How does she communicate that it's important for students to pay attention?  S: Hilary delivers her directions with controlled body language and a warm but serious tone.     T:  How you deliver a message—your body language, your facial expression, and certain qualities of your speech — contributes to how that message will be received by your audience.  We call these qualities of communication register. | Student Guide PowerPoint Video: Establish Formal Register: Hilary Lewis |
| 12 mins | Notes on Three Registers T: In any given interaction, we shift in and out of three registers: casual, formal, and urgent.   S: (Independently read the characteristics of speech and body language and facial expression associated with the communication registers in the graphic organizer in the 2.4 Student Guide.)   T: I am going to model the causal register. Observe my speech and body language. (Model the casual communication register as you read the PPT description of the casual register).  When is it appropriate to use this register?  S: Most of the time when teaching. (Add notes to the student guide).  T: I am going to model the formal register. Observe my speech and body language. (Model the formal communication register as you read the PPT description.)  When is it appropriate to use this register?  S: Most of the time when teaching in large groups, and when giving directions. (Add notes to the student guide).  T: I am going to model the urgent register. Observe my speech and body language. (Model the urgent communication register as you read the PPT description.)  When is it appropriate to use this register?  S: In emergencies. (Add notes to the student guide). | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Practice 2: Analyze Strong Voice in Action T: (Show “Establish Formal Register: Ijeoma Duru” and “Establish Formal Register: Emily Bisso.”) As you watch and listen to Hilary share her analysis of Formal Register in Ijeoma Duru's ninth-grade math class and Emily Bisso's fifth-grade history class, pay attention to the teachers’ speech and body language. Add your thoughts to the student guide.  S: (Add notes on how each teacher communicates the importance of her message through both her speech -i.e., quiet, slow, even, and low- and her body language on the 2.4 Student Guide.)  T: Review your graphic organizer and make any necessary additions and/or revisions.  S: (Add to graphic organizers.) | Student Guide  Video: “Establish Formal Register:  Ijeoma Duru”  Video: “Establish Formal Register:  Emily Bisso” |
| 5 mins | Debrief: T:  What additions and revisions did you make to the graphic organizers? (Call on several students.)    T: Some teachers may use communication registers differently. Highly effective teachers understand the impact of register on their students and use these registers intentionally.  For example, they often shift to a more formal register to ensure follow-through when needed.  T:  To review the different registers, I will read five different scenarios.  You are going to vote using the following hand signals on which register is most appropriate for the situation: 1: Formal register 2: Casual register 3: Urgent register A teacher greets her class and checks in with each student at the beginning of the day (casual) A teacher needs to explain the safety procedures for a new lab experiment (formal) A teacher gives clear instructions for the day’s reading assignment to the whole class. (formal) A teacher meets with students individually to provide feedback as they work on an assignment (casual) A student has an allergic reaction in class and the teacher needs to contact the office (urgent) | Student Guide |
