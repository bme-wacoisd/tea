Practice 1: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Reading

Read, Understanding Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation in the Classroom: What’s the Magic Formula? by Elizabeth Mulvahill. As you read, respond to the following questions:

- What is intrinsic motivation?

- Possible response: behavior is driven by internal rewards, such as pleasurable feelings, personal satisfaction, enjoyment, etc.  You don’t expect anything in return

- What is extrinsic motivation?

- Possible response: behavior is driven by external or tangible rewards, such as toys, food, etc. or to avoid punishment

- What are potential drawbacks to using a classroom reward system or a system that focuses on extrinsic motivation?

- Possible response: the extrinsic rewards offered through a classroom reward system provide only short-term effects; students can become dependent on the reward; rewards become an expectation and lose their effect; increased pressure and peer comparison, etc.

- How can teachers help build a student’s intrinsic motivation?

- Possible responses: get to know your students, give them ownership, autonomy, and purpose; explicitly teach basic social and emotional skills; practice goal setting, provide specific and actionable feedback; make real-world connections, etc.


Notes on Benefits and Drawbacks
Create a list of potential benefits and drawbacks to a classroom reward system.





| Positive Reinforcement | Feedback to students that follows a desired behavior and increases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated. |
| --- | --- |
| Behavior Management System | A reinforcement-based system that acknowledges and rewards students for positive behaviors. |
| Classroom Reward System | A system where students earn tangible rewards by exhibiting targeted behaviors. |
| Targeted Behavior | The discrete behaviors that are explicitly taught and reinforced. |
| Tangible rewards | Items such as stickers, dollars, toys, etc. that students can earn for exhibiting targeted behaviors. |
| Intrinsic Motivation | Behavior is driven by internal rewards, such as pleasurable feelings, personal satisfaction, enjoyment, etc.  You don’t expect anything in return. |
| Extrinsic Motivation | Behavior is driven by external or tangible rewards, such as toys, food, etc. or to avoid punishment |


| Benefits | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- |
| Positive behavior is reinforced Promotes positive and appropriate behavior Increased motivation Can provide a way for parents to track student behavior | Focuses on extrinsic motivation – behavior is driven by external rewards, such as toys, food, etc., opposed to intrinsic motivation - behavior that is driven by internal rewards, pleasurable feelings, enjoyment, etc.   Lacks specific feedback Can be difficult to manage over time Students become dependent on the reward Rewards become an expectation and lose their effect Increased pressure Potentially time-consuming for teachers (can detract from learning) |
