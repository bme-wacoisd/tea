- Complete the anticipation guide to review the criteria for deliberate practice.


- Based on the anticipation guide, what are the criteria for deliberate practice that you explored in the Science of Learning Unit?
Criteria for successful practice:
Authentic.
Spaced over time.
Low stakes.
Paired with feedback.

Intro to Practice
Write the definition below as they are discussed in the lesson.

Lesson Objective: Understand equal groups of as multiplication.
Assessment: Draw a picture to show 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. Then, write a multiplication sentence to represent the picture.



Practice #1 – Example
Look at an example lesson from Lesson 3 Grade 1 Skills 3 Unit and determine what students are practicing, how they are practicing, and how that practice builds upon itself. Then, explain how the student practice within the lesson is aligned with the objectives and assessments.


Practice #2 – Nonexample
With a partner, read the lesson plan below and determine what students are practicing, how they are practicing, and how that practice builds upon itself. Then, consider how the student practice aligns with the objectives and assessments within the lesson.




|  | Agree | Disagree | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The practice should require the student to be authentic or perform the actual learning goal. |  |  | Students need practice practicing the skill in an authentic way that addresses the learning goal. |
| Practice does not need to be spaced over time. |  |  | Knowledge or skills are made more lasting and permanent in your long-term memory when you practice them regularly over time. By regularly practicing, students pull ideas from their long term-memory into working memory and refresh and strengthen their understanding of that content. |
| Practice should be high-stakes and always count for a grade |  |  | The point of practice is to check your understanding before the stakes are high. Students should feel psychologically safe enough to practice free from fear of judgement, either by grading or other people. |
| Practice should be paired with timely feedback |  |  | it is important to receive timely feedback to ensure that the skills and content you are practicing are correct. |


| Guided Practice | A form of practice in which students practice the new skill or concept with support from the teacher and/or peers. |
| --- | --- |
| Independent Practice | A form of practice in which students independently apply what they have learned without support from the teacher or peers. |
| Deliberate Practice | Practice that performs the learning goal (authentic), is spaced over time, is low-stakes and is paired with feedback for improvement. |

| Practice can be guided (with teacher support) or independent (without teacher support). | Practice can be guided (with teacher support) or independent (without teacher support). |
| Examples | Nonexamples |
| Skip count as a class . Use counters to make equal groups. Add the groups and write a number sentence. Write repeated addition sentences to represent situations (4+4+4=12). Explain to a partner about how 3x4 =12 is related to 4+4+4 =12. Write multiplication sentences from equal groups. Complete a set of practice problems with a partner. Complete a set of practice problems independently. | Create and color a foldable to remember the lesson’s vocabulary. Cut and glue it into a math notebook. Write a poem or rap about multiplication. Talk to a partner about where you see multiplication in real life. Watch a video to learn a multiplication song and dance. |


| Learning Goal: Students will listen to and identify one-syllable words that have the /oo/ sound. | Learning Goal: Students will listen to and identify one-syllable words that have the /oo/ sound. | Learning Goal: Students will listen to and identify one-syllable words that have the /oo/ sound. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What are students practicing? | How are they practicing? | How does the practice build upon itself? |
| Identifying one-syllable words with the /oo/ sound. | Students say the /oo/ sound by stretching it out. Students provide examples of words with the /oo/ sound.  Students listen for words with the /oo/ sound as the teacher reads a story. Students clap each time they head the /oo/ sound. | The practice starts with a more simplistic skill of saying the /oo/ sound. Students then must produce words with the /oo/ sound and then listen for words with the /oo/ sound as the teacher reads a book. The skills progress from hearing the sound in isolation to hearing the sound in words. |
| How is the student practice within the lesson aligned with the objectives and assessments?  The student practice directly addresses the objective for the lesson and students are assessed on the exact skill they are practiced and that was modeled at the beginning of the activity. | How is the student practice within the lesson aligned with the objectives and assessments?

| Learning Goal: Students will be able to demonstrate understanding of coin values and create coin combinations that are equal to one dollar. | Learning Goal: Students will be able to demonstrate understanding of coin values and create coin combinations that are equal to one dollar. | Learning Goal: Students will be able to demonstrate understanding of coin values and create coin combinations that are equal to one dollar. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What are students practicing? | How are they practicing? | How does the practice build upon itself? |
| How to make a dollar with different coin combinations. | The teacher assigns each student to represent a specific coin. Students group up with other students around them to make a dollar. | The practice does not build. Students are assigned a specific coin value and they must work with a group to make a dollar. Then, students draw and label four different coin combinations to make a dollar. |
| How is the student practice within the lesson aligned with the objectives and assessments?  The practice aligned with the objective, which was to demonstrate understanding of coin values and create coin combinations to make a dollar. The only assessments are observations of the guided practice and independent practice activity. There was no other opportunity to see if students understood the concept. | How is the student practice within the lesson aligned with the objectives and assessments?
