Name:
Date:
A kindergarten teacher has created the following lesson goal and planned practice in her math lesson on the topic of attributes of two related objects.  Examine the lesson goal and the corresponding practice.  Does this practice activity reflect the characteristics of deliberate practice?  Explain why or why not.
Instructional Goal:  Students will analyze to find two objects that are the exactly the same or not exactly the same.
Planned practice:  Students will be shown pairs of socks in a variety of patterns, colors, sizes, and lengths in a laundry bag.  The teacher will hold up two socks and students will utilize the sentence stems “these are exactly the same because….” Or “these are NOT exactly the same because…”.  The class will work together to identify if the socks are exactly the same or not exactly the same with teacher feedback.  Then students will be given a group of pictures that they will sort individually into piles of “exactly the same” or “not exactly the same”.  After they are finished sorting, they will share their thinking with a partner.
