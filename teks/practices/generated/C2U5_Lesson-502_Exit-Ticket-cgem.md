Name:
Date:
Evaluate your copy of the formative assessment (provided by your teacher) in relationship to the success criteria. Complete the graphic organizer to show your thinking.
Ms. D. is teaching her 4th grade class about money. Specifically, the goal of this lesson is to teach students to express money amounts given in various forms as decimal numbers. Review the formative assessment linked below to determine whether it meets the characteristics of effective assessment. If the criteria are not met, provide a suggestion for improvement.




| Success Criteria | Criteria Met? Y or N | Reasoning for why  criteria was met or not met? | Suggestion for Improvement (If criteria was not met) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assessment is aligned with learning target(s) and measures appropriate levels of rigor based on learning target (aligned to and requires attention to the most important content) |  |  |  |
| Assessment is fair and transparent (matches expectations of learning focus, not a “gotcha”) |  |  |  |
| Assessment is practical (time, resources, student numbers) |  |  |  |
| Assessment is cognitively engaging (why and how) |  |  |  |
