| Rationale/ Summary | This is the second in a series of lessons that addresses the concept of effective directions. This lesson provides an opportunity for students to evaluate the effectiveness of directions, as well as use the criteria for effective directions to build their own directions for classroom activities. To implement strong routines, teachers need to know how to give specific, sequential, and observable directions. Additionally, this skill helps teachers move beyond routines to provide effective directions for students during non-routine moments in the classroom. | This is the second in a series of lessons that addresses the concept of effective directions.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students in Ms. West’s 3rd grade class are wrapping up an art activity before lunch. Students have markers and scissors scattered on their workspaces. Ms. West is going to visit each workspace to collect the materials. She would like students to have these materials ready for her to collect. She would also like individual students to be responsible for cleaning up their workspaces by throwing away scraps of paper on their way to lining up at the door. What directions should Ms. West give her students?  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Students in Ms. West’s 3rd grade class are wrapping up an art activity before lunch.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think about our classroom routine for transitioning from work with a partner or a group back to whole-group instruction. Develop a set of effective directions for this routine. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Review: Build a Rubric for Effective Directions T: In a few minutes, you will form groups of two and provide feedback to your partner on the effectiveness of the directions they developed in response to the Bellringer. In addition to giving feedback to your partner, you will also receive feedback on your directions.  T: To provide good feedback, it is helpful to use a rubric that captures what is expected. In this case, we need a rubric that sets out the characteristics of effective directions. Your Student Guide has a framework, and we will use what we learned in our previous class to complete it.  T: What is the first characteristic that effective directions share?  S: They are specific. They describe the concrete actions that students should take.  S: (Add to rubric in Student Guide.)  T: What is another characteristic they share?  S: They are sequential. They provide the order in which students need to complete the actions.  S: (Add to rubric in Student Guide.)  T: What is the final characteristic they share?  S: They are observable. The teacher can see the students following the directions.  S: (Add to rubric in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Feedback on Partner-Developed Directions T: In a moment, I’ll ask you to Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up. When I do, find a partner and exchange Student Guides. You will read what your partner wrote in response to the bellringer. Give them written feedback by placing an X in one of the columns next to each characteristic. Do their directions need to be improved? Are they aligned with the characteristic? Are they not only aligned, but also a great example of that characteristic? After you have placed checkmarks in three boxes, provide comments for your partner in the box under the rubric. You have five minutes.  S: (Form groups of two, exchange Student Guides, and provide written feedback by completing the rubric and additional comments.)  T: (Circulate to assist, as needed.)  T: Now, give your partner’s Student Guide back to them. Take two minutes to review the feedback you received.   S: (Review feedback silently).  T: Take three minutes to discuss the feedback you received with your partner. You might want to ask them questions about what they provided or share whether you agree or disagree with their feedback.  S: (Discuss feedback with partner.) | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice 2: Developing Effective Directions T: We will now work together to develop effective directions for example classroom activities.  T: Read the first scenario in your Student Guide to yourself.  S: (Read first scenario in Student Guide independently.)  T: Take 3 minutes to Turn and Talk about effective directions that Ms. North could give.  S: (Turn to partner and discuss directions.)  T: Can I have a volunteer share the directions that you developed with your partner?  S: Student answers may vary but may include: Everyone should sit at one of the tables in the center of the media center. We will divide into two groups. If your last name starts with A-L, you are in group 1. If your last name starts with M-Z, you are in group 2. Everyone in group 1, please raise your hand. Everyone in group 2, please raise your hand. The teacher checks to make sure students are raising their hands at the correct time. Now, only those in group 1 should stand up and move to one of the computer stations. Those in group 2 should remain seated. Now, those in group 2 should get up and gather no more than three sources from the other sections of the media center. Halfway through class, the teacher can send each group back to the tables in the center of the media center and repeat the directions to switch them between the computer stations and other resources.  T: Now, let’s assess the directions we just heard using the rubric we developed. What feedback would you give about whether the directions were specific?  S: They are specific. The students know what they are supposed to do – either research on the computer or research using other sources.  T: Would you rate the directions as “Exceeds Expectations” for specificity?  S: No. The directions were more specific for the students who are doing research using resources other than computers. They know they are supposed to find three sources.  T: Are these directions sequential?  S: Yes. The students know how they are supposed to move to their first type of research.  T: Would you say that these directions exceed expectations?  S: No. They’re good, but they just meet the definition.  T: What rating would you give for the extent to which the directions are observable?  S: They exceed expectations. The teacher asks to see who is in the two groups before she tells them to move so that she knows they are in the right groups. She tells them to move at different times so she can watch them carefully and make sure that they are following directions. She is observing them two times.  T: Read the second scenario in your Student Guide to yourself.  S: (Read second scenario in Student Guide independently.)  T: Take 3 minutes to Turn and Talk about effective directions that Ms. South could give.  S: (Turn to partner and discuss directions).  T: Can I have a volunteer share the directions that you developed with your partner?  S: Student answers may vary but may include: The teacher stands in-between the basketball court and the playground. She blows a whistle and put up her hand. She stays like that until all students have stopped moving and put up their hands. When I say “Go!” all students who played on the playground should walk to the door and line up against the building. Students on the basketball court should stay in place. Go! Now, students on the basketball court, if there is a basketball near you, pick it up. If there isn’t, stay in place. The teacher makes sure that all basketballs have been picked up. When I say “Go!” walk to the door. If you have a basketball, put it in the bin and then line up. If you don’t, line up as soon as you get back to the building. Go!   T: Are these directions specific?  S: Yes.  T: Would you say they exceed expectations?   S: No. The teacher could have been more specific about how they get in line, for example, if there is a certain order.  T: What would you mark on the rubric?  S: Meets expectations.  T: What is your feedback on if the directions are sequential?  S: They meet expectations. The students know the order of the directions, but they’re not above average.  T:  Are these directions observable?  S: Yes  T: Do they meet or exceed expectations for that criterion?  S: They exceed there. There are lots of times when the teacher can see that students are following the directions, like when they raise their hands and when they pick up the balls before they go back to the building. |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: When crafting effective directions, what do we need to ensure?  S: They need to be specific, sequential, and observable. It’s important for them to have all three characteristics.  T: If I asked you to redo your answer to the Bellringer, would you change what you wrote?  S: Answers may vary but may include: I wouldn’t change anything because my directions were already specific, sequential, and observable. I would write better instructions now that we have practiced how to do it. |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
