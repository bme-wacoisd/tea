Classroom Management Plan Template
Use this template to develop your Classroom Management Plan.

I.  Classroom Rules (emphasizing simplicity, clarity, positive framing, and student ownership):

II.  Classroom Procedures:
In the space below, describe your plan for managing classroom procedures.


III.  Classroom Layout:
In the space below, draw your classroom layout. Then, explain how your layout accounts for smooth transitions, whole group discussion, small group work, and ease of access to materials.



Application of Classroom Management: Behavior Management, Intervention, & Positive Relationships
Answer the following questions as you apply your knowledge of implementing effective classroom management. Keep in mind your grade level and content context as you respond.
- How does your classroom layout support strategies like Radar and Pastore’s Perch?
I will be able to give clear, observable directions and visually scan the room from various places throughout the classroom; I will also be able to position myself to be easily seen by students throughout the room. The placement of my desk in the corner of the classroom reinforces the use of Pastore’s Perch since I can see all students from the corner of the room.

- How will your rules support consistency and high expectations for your students?
- I will use my rules to support consistency and high expectations for students by:
- Establishing classroom routines and procedures
- Maintaining and equitably enforcing classroom rules for all
- Displaying visuals that remind students of classroom expectations

- Provide an example of a situation in which you would use each register.
- I will use a formal register when giving directions and getting students’ attention. I will use a casual register teaching content like normal. I will use the urgent register during emergencies.


- Describe how you will build relationships with students in the first week of school. Include at least two ideas.
- To build relationships with students, I will:
- Learn and call students by their preferred name, ensuring to pronounce it correctly.
- Learn about students’ interests, hobbies, and aspirations by having students write me a letter on the first day of school.
- Accept and celebrate students’ uniqueness and listen without judgment.


- A student in your class continues to district his peers, even after you have given him non-verbal cues and redirected his behavior early when possible. How will you manage this student’s behavior and support him in correcting the behavior? What strategies might you use and how will you use them?
- To manage student privacy, I will offer additional private correction to the student. I will describe what he is supposed to do (as opposed to what not to do) in order to meet expectations, use a warm or neutral tone, and start and end the interaction with a pair of observable directions. I will continue to build rapport with the student so that we establish mutual trust and respect. With the student, we may come up with a special non-verbal cue or hand signal that only he and I understand so that he knows to adjust his behavior in a private way.

| Write the script that you will use to introduce the classroom rules to your students.  Today, we are going to talk about our classroom rules. Our first rule is “follow directions quickly.” This rule means that as soon as I give you an instruction and the signal to go, you must immediately follow those directions.  It is important to follow rules quickly to minimize disruption to instruction and learning as well as maintain safety. Let’s practice! Class, when I say go, please quietly stand up, push in your chairs, and stand behind your desk. Go!   Rule 2 is “treat others with kindness.” This rule means that we should be respectful and kind to others by being friendly, considerate, and generous. When we are kind to others, we consider their feelings and consider the way we speak and act toward the person.  It is important to treat others with kindness because it allows us to connect with other people and build meaningful and positive relationships. Let’s practice! You heard a student say something mean to the person beside you. How can you show kindness?  Rule 3 is “talk at appropriate times and use appropriate voices.” This rule means that you must raise your hand for permission to speak during instruction or wait for when the teacher gives you the okay to talk. It also means that when speaking inside, you need to use quiet voices. It is important to talk at appropriate times and use appropriate voices because this ensures everyone remains focused on instruction and learning. Let’s practice! You just thought of something related to the lesson that you want to share with your teacher and the class. What do you do?   Rule 4 is “ensure that your work is just that, your work.” This rule means that all the work you complete must come from you. We must ensure that we allow ourselves and our classmates the opportunity to practice and complete their own work. It is important to complete our own work because it allows the teacher to see what we know and what we may need more help with. If we get answers from a friend, the teacher can’t accurately tell what we truly know or don’t know. Let’s practice! I just gave you a math problem to complete. You start working, but you aren’t sure if you are completing the problems correctly, what do you do? |

| Giving Feedback | Circulate the room while students are working to provide timely, specific, and actionable feedback.

| This layout offers plenty of space for students to move around to different parts of the room (e.g., class library, computer stations, student storage). Small group work is facilitated by students sitting in groups and the teacher can easily move around the classroom to each group. For whole group discussion, the desks can be moved without too much work to make a circle shape, or students can have the ability to simply move their chairs to make a class discussion more engaging. Finally, students have easy access to materials like books, computers, their personal items, and the teacher’s desk and whiteboard in the event that they need any additional supports. |
