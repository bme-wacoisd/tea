### Lesson 5.04: Introduction to Informal Formative Assessment Strategies

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Review the scenario below. Place a carrot (^) in the lesson plan anywhere you think would be a good spot for a formative assessment. Then, use the graphic organizer below to explain your reasoning.

Mr. N. is teaching his second graders a lesson about solids and liquids. By the end of the lesson, he’d like his students to be able to define solids and liquids, categorize objects as either solid or liquid, and create a claim about the differences between solids and liquids. When students enter the classroom, Mr. N. asks them to take out their notebooks (^) and asks them to copy the definitions of solid and liquid from the board. Mr. N. shows an example of a solid and a liquid and then models a think-aloud to show students how he determines whether a number of additional items are liquids or solids. (^) Then he puts students into small groups to rotate through various stations. At each station, there is a new material to explore and categorize. Students have a graphic organizer to complete as they rotate, and Mr. N. guides the class in a discussion after students have visited all stations. The discussion focuses on what students noticed about the samples, how they categorized the samples, and the main differences between the samples. At the end of the discussion, (^) Mr. N. is satisfied that students are ready to move to the next lesson.



#### Introduction to Informal Formative Assessment Strategies

Take notes about the strategies below.

#### Practice 1: Scenario Analysis

Read the scenarios below. For each, choose an informal formative assessment strategy and explain your thinking.




|  | Why is an assessment needed? | What information should be gathered? | How might the information inform next steps? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ^1 | To determine prior knowledge of students | What they already know about solids and liquids | Mr. N. would know if there were gaps in learning he needed to address prior to the lesson or if there were parts of the lesson he could skip. |
| ^2 | Students are about to do work in small groups without the teacher’s guidance | Whether or not students understand how to think through categorizing solids and liquids | Mr. N. would know if they were ready to work on their own or if they needed a few more examples. |
| ^3 | Mr. N. needs to know individual understanding of the lesson. | Whether or not individuals are able to make a claim about the difference between solids and liquids | Mr. N. would know if all students were ready to move to the next lesson or not. He would know individually whether students were able to create a claim about the differences between solids and liquids. |


| Strategy | Description | When/Why/How | Benefits / Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Thumbs up, down, sideways | Students use their thumbs to indicate their own self-assessment of understanding. Thumb up means I get it, thumb down means I don’t get it, thumb sideways means I partially understand but still have some questions or confusion. | Use to get a pulse check of how students are feeling about the lesson. Ask students to indicate their level of understanding with thumbs up, thumbs down, or thumbs sideways. | Benefits: The teacher can quickly gauge student confidence in the lesson.  Drawbacks: Because this strategy is a self-assessment, it does not allow a teacher to assess mastery of content. |
| Red, yellow, green cards | Like thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideways, these cards are used to assess students’ self-assessment of their understanding. A green card means I’m good to go, a yellow card means I’m a little confused, a red card means I need immediate help. | Red, yellow, green cards can be used throughout a lesson to monitor student self-assessment. Cards can be kept on the corner of each desk and students can indicate their current feeling at any time. This allows the teacher to quickly attend to students who display a red card during group or independent work. Cards can also be used at specific moments in whole class instruction. At any moment in the instruction, the teacher can ask students to hold up a card indicating their current level of understanding. This allows the teacher to get a sense of the class as a whole to inform their overall pacing.  Because this strategy is a self-assessment, it does not allow a teacher to assess mastery of content. | Benefits: The teacher can quickly gauge student confidence in the lesson; when students are working independently or in small groups, the teacher can quickly prioritize students who are unable to move forward without support  Drawbacks: Because this strategy is a self-assessment, it does not allow a teacher to assess mastery of content. Students may overuse the red card to rely on teacher support. |
| Fist to five | Like cards and thumbs, fist to five indicates students’ self-assessment of their understanding where holding up a fist (zero) indicates total confusion and holding up five fingers indicates complete comprehension. Students indicate levels between by holding up 1, 2, 3, or 4 fingers. | Use to get a pulse check of how students are feeling about the lesson. Ask students to indicate their level of understanding by holding up a fist to five. Explain the indicators the first few times until the assessment becomes routine.   Fist = I am totally lost One = I am pretty confused.  Two = I understand a few bits and pieces but can’t put it all together.  Three = I’m beginning to put things together.  Four = I understand.  Five = I understand and could teach this to someone else.  Because this strategy is a self-assessment, it does not allow a teacher to assess mastery of content. | Benefits: The teacher can quickly gauge student confidence in the lesson; provides more nuance than thumbs.  Drawbacks: Because this strategy is a self-assessment, it does not allow a teacher to assess mastery of content. |
| White boards | Provide all students with a small, individual white board, white board marker, and eraser. Students respond to questions using their personal white board | White boards can be used to assess mastery of content. The teacher poses specific, content-based questions and provides time for all students to write their responses on their individual white boards before asking students to hold up their responses for the teacher to see. | Benefits: The teacher can quickly scan for correct answers; all students are provided the opportunity to answer the question; assesses content.   Drawbacks: The students quickly erase their answers, so the teacher does not have a record of individual responses. The activity provides an overall perspective of the class as a whole, but doesn’t necessarily provide lasting insight about individual students unless the teacher takes the time to record observations between each question. |
| Think-Pair-Share | Students have time to respond individually to a prompt before pairing up to discuss and compare their answers. | Provide a prompt and time for students to respond individually. Then, instruct them to find a partner and provide time to compare and discuss. Teacher circulates and monitors discussions. | Benefits: Provides opportunity for students to learn with and from peers; assesses content.   Drawbacks: Can be time consuming, teacher may or may not have time to hear all student discussions; does not necessarily allow a teacher to gauge individual understanding unless they take time to record observations as they monitor. |
| Four Corners | Students respond to a multiple-choice question by moving to the corner of the room that indicates their choice. | Post letters in each corner of the room (A, B, C, D). Pose a multiple-choice question and ask students to move to the corner of the room that indicates their choice. Provide an opportunity for students to share their reasoning and attempt to convince their peers of the correct choice. | Benefits: Provides opportunity for students to learn with and from their peers; assesses content; allows for movement in the classroom.   Drawbacks: Can be time consuming; students may engage in “group think” by following someone they think has the right answer instead of making their own selection; does not necessarily allow a teacher to gauge individual understanding unless they take time to record observations during the activity. |
| Quick Poll | Students respond to poll questions using devices. | Create a poll for students using technology (Poll Everywhere, Mentimeter, Google Forms, Kahoot, etc.) | Benefits: The poll can be used to assess content and will quickly provide feedback to the teacher about percentage correct.   Drawbacks: The teacher may have no indication of individual student responses; students may not have access to technology; technology may or may not work. |


| Scenario | Strategy | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ms. P. has just provided her students with instructions for their groupwork. Before she moves them into groups, she wants to be sure they are confident in their understanding of what they are supposed to do. What informal assessment might Ms. P. use? | Thumbs up, down, sideways | Ms. P. wants to know if students are confident or not in understanding the directions. She doesn’t need a nuanced picture (which would more appropriately use fist to five) but just a yes/no. It is OK for her to get a pulse of the whole class because if only a few students don’t understand they will be supported by their groups. This is not a content question. |
| Ms. P. wants to monitor group progress during their groupwork. She knows that some of the stations groups will visit can be a little tricky. Because groups will be at different stations at different times, she doesn’t want to stop the whole class to clarify instructions or content. She also knows that some groups have student leaders who will be able to help maneuver their groups through the tricky spots. She will need to monitor the various groups to identify which ones are beginning to feel stuck and when they can no longer move forward without her so she can prioritize her time. What informal assessment might Ms. P. use? | Red, yellow, green cards | Each group can have a card to indicate their progress. If things are moving smoothly, they will display a green card. When they get stuck, they can turn it to yellow so Ms. P. can keep an eye on them. If a student leader gets them through the confusion, they can turn back to green but if they need Ms. P., they can display red. Ms. P. will be able to prioritize which groups she visits throughout the groupwork station time. |
| Ms. P.’s students have a test coming up. As a part of a test review, Ms. P. would like to see how they do on some of the test questions but would also like to hear their reasoning so she can identify misconceptions to address in the days before the test. What informal assessment might Ms. P. use? | Four Corners or Think-Pair-Share depending on what the test questions will look like. | Both activities give Ms. P. the opportunity to assess student understanding of content as well as the opportunity to hear their reasoning out loud. |
| As a warm-up before a lesson on division, Ms. P. wants to see how her class does on simple multiplication problems. She’s looking to see how quickly they can complete these problems and how accurate their responses are. What informal assessment might Ms. P. use? | White boards | White boards will allow Ms. P. to see how quickly and accurately her students answer multiple choice questions. She can pose a multiplication problem, set a time, and then ask students to reveal their responses when the timer goes off. She can scan the room for the number of correct responses in the time provided. A poll might work as well but may be trickier to navigate in terms of timing each problem. |
