Mark the following statements as true or false. If false, correct the statement so that it is true.
- It is important for a teacher mentor to have a lot in common with their mentee so they can establish a friendship.


- Mentor teachers usually have several years of experience and can provide guidance to their mentees about academics, classroom management, stress management, work-life balance, and a variety of other topics.


- Mentees should not reach out to their mentor teachers with questions since mentor teachers are usually very busy. They should wait for their mentors to reach out to them.

- If a beginning teacher is doing a good job, they no longer need a mentor teacher.


- Only beginning teachers need mentors.

- Mentors often learn as much from their mentees as they teach them.


- All mentorships are formal, documented processes.
