| Learning Goal  Students will determine the implicit and explicit meaning in a poem, citing textual evidence. | Activity A  Students will read the poem independently. They will then turn and talk with their partner focusing on the question: “What stood out most to you when you read the poem?”  After discussing what stood out most, students will spend some time writing a poem that reflects an important experience in their past. Then students will read their poem aloud to the class. |
