Routine #1:
When students are finished with a test, quiz, or other classroom activity before others in the class, they are expected to turn the work over and move it to the corner of their desk. Next, students are expected to get out their “book of choice” from the library and read until everyone else has finished.

Routine #2:
During some text-based, small group discussions, students engage in an activity called Say, Mean, Matter. During their own independent reading, students choose a piece of the text that they find important and complete a graphic organizer to paraphrase the text, explain what it means, and reflect on why it matters. Then, in small groups, each student shares their Say, Mean, Matter and the group engages in a responsive discussion.
