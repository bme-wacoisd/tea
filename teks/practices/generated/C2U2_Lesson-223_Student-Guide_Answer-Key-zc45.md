Bellringer:
A student’s behavior is disrupting the lesson. The student is yelling out during class and throwing materials. Why would a teacher choose to talk to the student privately instead of redirecting him in front of the other students?
Answers will vary.











Intro to Private Individual Corrections

Key Terms
Define the key terms below.

What are the five keys to private individual corrections?
- Maintain privacy

- Use a warm or neutral tone
- Bookend with simple tasks
- Keep it brief
Video Notes
Listen to an interview with Doug Lemov and Nicole Willey, who teaches third grade at Leadership Prep Ocean Hill as they talk about Private Individual Corrections. Take note of the steps and important practices while implementing Private Individual Corrections.

Make sure others are doing something else, lower the tone of voice, eye contact, get down to students’ level, give student an observable and actionable goal




Five Keys to Private Individual Correction


Practice 1: Analyze Private Individual Correction in Action, Part 1
In your small group, look for evidence of one of the five keys of effective implementation: Maintain Privacy, Describe the Solution, Use a Warm or Neutral Tone, Bookend with Simple Tasks, and Keep it Brief.

Watch the video of the analysis of a Private Individual Correction in a fifth-grade math class and capture evidence of your assigned key in the video analysis graphic organizer below.



Practice 2: Analyze Private Individual Correction in Action, Part 2
Watch the video of an analysis of two whisper corrections in a fifth-grade math class and capture evidence of your assigned key in the video analysis graphic organizer below.


| Private Individual Correction | Individually addressing student behavior as privately as possible. |
| --- | --- |
| Privacy/Confidentiality | Being out of sight or hearing of other people |
| Tone | The way a person speaks to someone |
| Bookend | Start and end your interaction with a pair of observable directions |
| In-Task | Task that students can complete to show they’re ready |
| Out-Task | Task that tells students what they can do to get back on track right away |


| Keys for Effective Private Individual Correction | Evidence from the video |
| --- | --- |
| Maintain Privacy:  Here are a few ways you can maintain the privacy of your correction: Give the class a task to complete so that you're intervening at a time when it's easy to be "off-stage" Circulate for a moment instead of making a bee-line to the student so that other students have a moment to get started Crouch down to the student's eye level Speak quietly | Bridget circulates the room instead of making a bee-line to the student who is snickering at the student who is struggle to read the word “examine”. Bridget gives the class a task to complete so that she can deliver her private individual correction while the rest of the class is busy at work. She crouched down to convey warmth and enhance privacy and spoke with the student quietly. |
| Describe the Solution:  Describe what you’d like your student to do (as opposed to what not to do) in order to meet your expectations (e.g., “During class discussion, it's important that you give your peers your full attention: eyes and ears on them.”).  This lets students know what they did wrong while also ensuring they learn from it. | Bridget provided a clear direction for what the student needed to do to get back to the path of success. |
| Use a Warm or Neutral Tone:  It can be challenging to maintain emotional constancy when delivering a Private Individual Correction, especially if you've already redirected the student several other times in different ways.  But communicating your frustration through your tone will only undermine your efforts to get your student back on track.  Therefore, be sure to use a warm or neutral tone of voice when you speak. | Bridget maintained a neutral tone when delivering the private individual correction. |
| Bookend with Simple Tasks:  Start and end your interaction with a pair of observable directions.  Start with an “in-task” that students can complete to show they’re ready (e.g., “Pause your writing” or, "Eyes on me, please.") Close with an “out-task” that tells students what they can do to get back on track right away (e.g., “Pick up your pencil and begin right away. Thank you.” or “Start with question 1. Thank you.”) | Bridget told the student to “track me” and told the student what he needed to do to get back on track – being respectful and compassion while a student was working through some things. |
| Keep it Brief:  Keep the correction short so that the student can get back to the learning as quickly as possible. | Bridget kept her correction short so the student could get back to learning as quickly as possible. |

This allowed private correct even though he did not walk over to the student. |
| Describe the Solution:  Describe what you’d like your student to do (as opposed to what not to do) in order to meet your expectations (e.g., “During class discussion, it's important that you give your peers your full attention: eyes and ears on them.”).  This lets students know what they did wrong while also ensuring they learn from it. | Jason told the student who was off task exactly what she needed to be doing. |
| Use a Warm or Neutral Tone:  It can be challenging to maintain emotional constancy when delivering a Private Individual Correction, especially if you've already redirected the student several other times in different ways.  But communicating your frustration through your tone will only undermine your efforts to get your student back on track.  Therefore, be sure to use a warm or neutral tone of voice when you speak. | Jason used a neutral tone to correct the student who was off task. |

Start with an “in-task” that students can complete to show they’re ready (e.g., “Pause your writing” or, "Eyes on me, please.")

Thank you.”) | Not present in this video clip. |
| Keep it Brief:  Keep the correction short so that the student can get back to the learning as quickly as possible. | Jason said, “I’m writing, you’re writing. Don’t miss it.” He kept his correction short so the student could get back to work. |
