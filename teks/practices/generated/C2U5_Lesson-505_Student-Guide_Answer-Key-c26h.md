## Student Guide – Answer Key

### Lesson 5.05: Introduction to Strategic Questioning

Bellringer: Read the scenario and complete the activity below.
The goal of your 4th grade science class today is to teach students to analyze data to describe the relationship between characteristics (category of descriptions, like color) and traits (distinct description, like red). The following are two questions from your lesson:
What is one characteristic of tomatoes?
How would you describe the relationship between characteristics and traits? Provide an example using tomatoes.

Analyze these two questions from your lesson using the guiding questions below.
What is similar about these questions?
They are both address characteristics and they both focus on tomatoes.
What is different about these questions?
The first one is a what question. The second is a how question. The second one asks for students to defend their answers with an example.
How would you describe the thinking required by each question?
The first one requires simple thinking about just one thing. The second requires more complex thinking that asks a student to think about at least two things (characteristics and traits) and how they are connected. The first requires just a one-word answer. The second requires an explanation.
Where in the lesson would you expect to find each question and why?
The first might be in the beginning to be sure students understand characteristics. The second would come later in the lesson after students have learned about characteristics and traits and have had some time to practice.


#### Notes: Introduction to Strategic Questioning



#### Practice 1: Question Evaluation

#### Review the lesson objective and related lesson below. Evaluate each question based on the first two criteria for effective questions. If a question does not fit both criteria, revise or make suggestions for improvement.


Lesson Objective: Support a claim that individuals of the same species have the same characteristics but can have different traits.

Basketball Questioning
In Basketball Questioning, the teacher moves questions and discussion responses around the room. The teacher poses a question that is answered initially by one student. Teacher then asks additional students to evaluate and/or add to the initial answer. In this way, ideas and responses are moved around the class and students build on one other another’s ideas and comments.
Use this technique when:
- There is more than one appropriate response to a question

- When you want to build on and connect ideas between students






| Characteristic | Example | Non-Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Be meaningful and understandable to students (succinct) | Example: What is one characteristic of this tomato? | Given this specimen that you see in front of you, what qualities would you attribute to this delectable fruit? |
| Focus on the most important content | What is one word that describes this tomato? | Do you like tomatoes? Why or why not? |
| Align to the level of thinking required in the learning target | Ending the tomato lesson with the question – How would you describe the relationship between characteristics and traits? | Ending the tomato lesson with the questions – What is a characteristic? What is a trait? |
| Increase in complexity and demand as learning progresses | Varying question types throughout the lesson while steadily increasing to get to the highest complexity required by the learning target | Keeping questioning at the same level of complexity throughout a lesson, starting with the hardest questions at the beginning of a lesson |


| Question | Is it succinct? | Is if focused on the most important content? | Revisions or Suggestions for improvement if necessary. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What is an example of a characteristic of all humans? | Yes | Yes | None |
| What is a trait – by trait remember that we mean something that distinguishes you in terms of a particular characteristic – you have that relates to that characteristic that we just mentioned that is an example of a characteristic of all humans? | No | Yes | Delete the reminder about what a trait is. The teacher can add a question to be sure the students know what a trait is before asking this question. Simplify the last part of the question by naming the characteristic. |
| How are you like a fruit? | Yes | No | Change to: How are you like the person sitting next to you? Add: How are you different than the person sitting next to you? |
| What is always similar about individuals of the same species? | Yes | Yes |  |
| In what ways are individuals that come from the same species and may be alike in many ways also different from one another in other ways? | No | Yes | What can be different about individuals of the same species? |
| How are plants and animals similar and different? | Yes | No | Plants and animals are not members of the same species. Use two examples of the same species instead of plants and animals. |
