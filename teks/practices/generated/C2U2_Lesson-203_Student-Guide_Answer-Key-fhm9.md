- From the list below, circle effective strategies that a teacher might use to build relationships with their students.



- What affect could it have on a student who spent several years in a classroom with a teacher who did not build strong relationships? Consider the student’s academic progress as well as their attitude about school.

- Students who do not have strong relationships with their teachers are less likely to engage in academic risk. This means that their academic progress might not be as strong as other students. They also might disengage from the classroom. Disengagement will also impact academic progress.



Practice 1: Scenario Analysis (Examples and Non-Examples)
Review the scenarios below. For each, identify what the teacher is doing well to build trusting relationships and what the teacher might do better.

Scenario 1: Complete with the class.


Scenarios 2 and 3: Complete with a partner.



Practice 2: Role Play
Review the scenario below. In your group, provide each group member an opportunity to respond to the scenario using different strategies. After each round, discuss strategies used. Use the graphic organizer below to guide your discussion and record key ideas.
Scenario: Mr. Benton is engaged in facilitating a whole class discussion. During the discussion, two students disagree with one another and begin to argue. The argument escalates. How should Mr. Benton handle the situation and diffuse the argument while building trusting relationships with the students who are arguing?


| Learns all students’ names in the first week of school | “Jokes around” with students using sarcastic comments about their work | Breaks down difficult problems but allows students to solve them. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frequently raises voice and gets visibly upset with students who are not listening. | Wears clothes that kids might think are cool | Greets students every day with a calm voice and a smile |
| Allows students who are struggling to do easier work | Follows through on a promise to have lunch with the students on Wednesdays | Allows student to play during class because they probably need a break. |


| Example 1: Middle school teachers have 10 minutes with their students in between lunch and the next class. Mrs. Sherron uses the time to read a book aloud to students. She insists that students do not talk during this time but allows them to draw or put their heads down to rest. |
| --- |
| What is the teacher doing well?  Students are in a structured environment that is safe. Providing quiet time for students can help them to feel calm before beginning their next class; students have choice as to what they want to do, including listening to the story, laying their heads down, or drawing. Giving students choice is empowering to them. |
| What can the teacher do better?  Even though students have choice in what they do, the things they are doing are not productive. Putting their heads down or drawing may not be the most efficient way to spend 10 minutes of the school day. Mrs. Sherron could come up with a quiet activity that is related to the content but that the students would find interesting. Additionally, Mrs. Sherron could allow students to talk and engage with one another through structured games or activities that could build her relationship with the students. |


| Scenario 2: Students are working in groups when the teacher notices a verbal argument between two students. The students seem to be arguing over a note on their table. One student is clearly agitated and is raising her voice. Mrs. Baker moves within close proximity of the students, she speaks in a low voice to remind the students of the rules for working with groups. She removes the note but does not read it. She asks the students to students to retrieve the note after class when she has a chance to talk with them. |
| --- |
| What is the teacher doing well?  Mrs. Baker is building trust with the students by speaking to them in a low voice and not yelling at them in front of their classmates. Additionally, she did not read the note which shows the students she is respecting their privacy. Asking the students to retrieve the note after class will give her a chance to speak with them away from their peers which would eliminate the risk for embarrassment. |
| What can the teacher do better? One of the students was raising her voice, which means the disagreement has escalated. The teacher should suggest the students work in different groups for the duration of the class period to keep the situation from escalating further. |
| Scenario 3: During independent work time, a student realizes he needs a new pencil. He approaches the teacher’s desk, opens a drawer, and goes through her materials until he finds a pencil. The teacher asks, “Ben, what do you think you’re doing?” He responds that he needs a pencil. The teacher says, “Okay, just remember to bring your own next time.” |
| What is the teacher doing well?  When the student explained that he was looking for a pencil, the teacher did not yell or berate him. She reminded him of the expectation to bring his own pencil and allowed him to get back to work. |
| What can the teacher do better? Students should not go through a teacher or classmates personal belongings without permission. The teacher should walk around the room and when she approaches the students desk crouch down to quietly remind him of the classroom expectations. |
