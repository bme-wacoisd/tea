## Gallery Walk

## What is a Gallery Walk?

A Gallery Walk is an activity during which artifacts are set up around a room and a piece of chart paper or other shared workspace is provided for students to visually (verbally and/or artistically) share their thinking based on teacher-prepared question(s) or prompt(s) at east station. Students move through the room, rotating from one artifact to the other. Depending on the teacher’s understanding of their students, lesson plan, and activity outcomes, rotations can be timed or free-flowing, and students can work independently, in pairs, or in small groups.
### How does a teacher prepare for a Gallery Walk?


- Identify the appropriate artifact or artifacts based on lesson objectives.
- Identify the question(s) or prompt(s) for each artifact. Questions(s) or prompt(s) can be the same for each artifact or different depending on the goals of the formative assessment.
- Create a station for each artifact. The station should include the artifact and a place for students to respond.
- Make key decisions:
- Will students work alone, in pairs, or in groups?
- Will rotations be timed or free-flowing?
- Instruct students to rotate through the stations based on teacher instructions. At each station, they should respond to the prompts(s), or question(s) based on the station’s artifact. They can respond verbally or artistically. They can also use symbols to respond to their peers (for example, they can use a check mark to agree, an x to disagree, a smiley face if they like someone’s response).
- Shared student responses are analyzed to help the teacher understand what students are thinking – including connections they can make.

### How do students engage in a Gallery Walk?


- Students rotate from station to station individually, in pairs, or in groups.
- At each station, students review the artifact and related prompt(s) or question(s).
- Using the shared workspace (chart paper, sticky note wall, etc.), students share their thinking verbally or artistically.
- Students read/review what others have posted before them. Students can respond by agreeing, disagreeing, liking, adding additional information, or commenting.

### When might teachers use Gallery Walks as a formative assessment?


Gallery walks can be used when teachers are looking for information about how students analyze artifacts, make connections between artifacts, draw distinctions between artifacts, agree and/or disagree with one another.
For example:

- Mr. Eire used a gallery walk at the beginning of a science unit on properties of soil. He placed two soil samples at each station and asked students to compare the two samples. He was interested in collecting data about what they already knew about soil and what key vocabulary they might use in their descriptions.
- Ms. Waters used a gallery walk in the middle of an ELA lesson on the impact of author’s craft on mood. She posted quotations from various texts around the room. At each station, students were asked to read the quotation and respond by identifying literary devices the author used in the quotation and sharing the impact of the devices on their feelings as readers.

Gallery Walks are NOT the best form of assessment when a teacher wants to assess lower-level thinking or when there is only one correct response per station.

## Graphic Organizers

## What are Graphic Organizers?


Graphic Organizers are visual learning tools that help students organize their ideas. Graphic Organizers include pre-structured tools like Venn diagrams, KWL charts, sequence charts, story maps, and cause/effect organizers. Pre-structured tools provide the structure for students to make connections between ideas. Other graphic organizers – like concept maps and cluster bubbles – are not pre-structured and are used so students can organizer information in their own way.

### How does a teacher prepare for using Graphic Organizers?


- Determine the purpose of the graphic organizer. What information do you want students to organize? How do you want it organized?
- Based on purpose, determine whether you will provide a pre-structured graphic organizer or ask students to organize the information on their own.
- If pre-structured, identify the structure or create your own based on content.
- Provide copies of the organizer with instructions for all students.

### How do students use Graphic Organizers?

- If students are using a pre-structured graphic organizer, they will follow the structure and insert information in appropriate areas of the organizer.
- If students are creating their own graphic organizer, they will create a visual representation of their thinking based on the specific instructions of the activity (concept maps, cluster diagrams, etc.)

### When might teachers use Graphic Organizers as a formative assessment?


Graphic organizers can be used when teachers want to assess students’ understanding of the relationship between ideas. If the teacher wants to assess students’ understanding of a pre-determined relationship (like compare/contrast or change over time) the teacher will provide a pre-structured tool (like a Venn diagram for compare/contrast or a timeline for change over time). If the teacher wants to assess how the students are organizing ideas for themselves, they might consider using a concept map (introduced in Unit 4) or cluster diagram (see example below).


For example:

- In a history class on the causes of the American Revolution, Mr. Avery wants to assess students’ understanding of multiple causes of the revolution and their immediate effects on conditions between the British and Americans. Mr. Avery asks students to use a cause/effect organizer to organize and share their thinking.
- Ms. Huber’s ELA class is about to write compare/contrast essays. She asks students to submit a Venn diagram before they begin writing so that she can gauge their understanding of the similarities and differences between the two texts they will be writing about.
- In his science class, students have just learned key vocabulary about the food pyramid. Before moving into his lesson on food and energy transfer, he wants to see what connections students can make between the vocabulary words. He asks students to create a concept map connecting the words.
- Pre-structured graphic organizers are NOT the best form of assessment when you are interested in learning how students make connections between ideas on their own. Unstructured graphic organizers are NOT the best form of assessment when there is one specific way students should structure information.

## Learning Logs

## What are Learning Logs?

Learning logs are a record of student observations and reflections over time. They are best used in multi-day lessons or even multi-week units. They provide insight into what and how students are thinking about the material as well as questions they have. Using learning logs helps students develop a habit of reflection and develop metacognitive skills (skills that help them understand their own thinking and become aware of how they learn).
Adapted from: https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/school/teachers/teachingresources/Formative-assessment-strategies.pdf

How does a teacher prepare for using Learning Logs?

- Identify a learning segment for which you’d like to track student thinking, questions, reflections, and self-assessment.
- Create a learning log with broad guiding questions and a space for daily reflection (see graphic organizers).
- Provide time daily or weekly for students to self-reflect.
- Use learning logs for personal check-ins and conferences with students.

### How do students use Learning Logs?


- Respond to the broad guiding questions in the space provided on a daily or weekly basis.
- Include reflections on personal learning (What are you learning? What are you still confused about? What is easy? What is hard?)
- Include questions about learning.
- Use your learning log to engage in conversations with your peers and your teacher about your progress.

### When might teachers use Learning Logs as a formative assessment?

Learning logs are ideal when teachers are interested not only in what students are learning but also in how they are learning it and what questions arise from new learning. Teachers can use the information in learning logs not only to understand student progress but also to self-reflect on the impact of their instruction over time. Learning logs should be used when learning and assessment will take place over an extended time and when teachers want to develop skills of personal reflection and self-assessment.

Learning logs are NOT effective assessments when the teacher wants to focus only on assessing content.
For example:

- Ms. Nash is teaching her students to write persuasive essays. They will engage in numerous activities over the course of three weeks to explore persuasive essays, break down the parts of persuasive essays, practice the parts of persuasive essays, and then develop their own persuasive essays. Ms. Nash is interested in how her students’ observations and understanding progress over time. She’d also like to give them some practice in self-assessment, so they learn how to be constructively critical of their own work for opportunities to revise.
- Mr. Xia is about to teach a financial literacy unit in his math class. Because financial literacy is a lifelong and real-world skill, he’d like to help his students develop the habit of reflecting on their financial practices. He’s also teaching the unit in a new way this year and would like to gather some information that helps him understand how each lesson in his unit is supporting student learning. He decides a learning log will help students develop lifelong habits and give him insight into how his unit is working.

## ABCD Cards (and other forms of Multiple Choice)

## What are ABCD Cards?

ABCD cards allow students to quickly respond to multiple choice questions posed during a lesson. Questions can be posed spontaneously by the teacher or can be pre-planned. Students each have two cards – one with A on the front and B on the back and another with C on the front and B on the back. When the teacher poses a multiple-choice question, students hold up the card that corresponds with their response for a quick and informal assessment of student understanding.

Multiple choice questions in their more traditional paper and pencil form can also be used as a more formal assessment of student learning at strategic moments in the lesson.

### How does a teacher prepare for ABCD Cards?


- Prepare and provide cards for each student in the class. Ask students to keep their cards available throughout the lesson.
- Pre-plan questions at key moments in the lesson based on what students need to know prior to the next step in the lesson. During key moments, pose each question verbally and visually where students can see it.
- For a more formal approach to ABCD Cards, create a set of multiple-choice questions for students to complete with paper and pencil.

### How do students use ABCD Cards?


- Keep cards readily available throughout the lesson.
- When a multiple-choice question is posed by the teacher, hold up your response.


### When might teachers use ABCD Cards (and other forms of multiple-choice questions) as a formative assessment?

ABCD cards and formal paper and pencil assessments when they are focused only on the content of the lesson. These assessments should also be used when there is only one correct response to the question. While multiple choice questions are often used for basic recall questions, strategically creating deeper multiple-choice questions can allow a teacher to use multiple choice to gauge higher order thinking as well as foundational recall knowledge.

ABCD Cards and other forms of multiple-choice questions are NOT effective assessments when the teacher wants to focus on student reflection or when there is more than one correct answer to a question.
For example:

- Ms. Pierre has been teaching her students to say the names of colors in French. At the beginning of a lesson, she wants to quickly review the colors and see if any of them are causing trouble. She uses ABCD cards to ask students to identify the French word for each color from 4 choices.
- Mr. Morales has been teaching his students their times tables. They have been practicing 6’s and 7’s. Before he moves on to 8’s, he wants to review the last two times tables with them. He uses ABCD cards for students to quickly respond to multiple choice questions that multiply numbers by 6’s and 7’s.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Examine the Exit Ticket below. As you read, consider whether the exit ticket meets each indicator of the success criteria or not. Complete the graphic organizer to show your thinking and provide suggestions for improvement if criteria are not met. | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | T: What did you think of the exit ticket? What were its strengths and what needed to be improved?   S: (Volunteer responses and make corrections as necessary.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | Jigsaw Setup  T: So far, we’ve learned about several formative assessment strategies. We’ve talked about informal formative assessments, including quick and visible assessments. We’ve talked about strategic questioning, which can be used informally during classroom conversations as well as more formally in pre-planned activities, and we’ve talked about the more formal exit ticket. Today, we are going to spend some time exploring additional strategies – including some strategies you may have seen teacher use in the field.   T: We are going to use a strategy called Jigsaw today. You will learn more about how to use this strategy in one of our later units. To use Jigsaw, I will break you up into groups of 4. In your groups, you will each choose one of the 4 formative assessments strategies to become an expert on. Each member of your group will become an expert on one strategy and then share their expertise with the rest of the group.   T: Please move into your groups. These are called your home groups. (Post groups of 4 visually so students can see who they are working with and move to their groups.  S: (Move into home groups.)  T: Here are the 4 strategies you must choose from. (Post strategies visually so students can see them.) Gallery Walk Graphic Organizers Learning Logs ABCD Cards  T: Work with your group to determine who will become an expert on which strategy. You might want to choose a strategy you have seen used when you’ve been observing in the field. Remember, each person in your group will need to choose a different strategy.  S: (Choose/assign strategies so each group member has a different one.)  T: Now, you are going to move into expert groups. You will become an expert on your strategy with the students from other groups who also chose that strategy. In your expert groups, you will learn about and prepare to teach your strategy to your home group.  T: Notice that I have posted the name of one strategy in each of the four corners of the room. In a minute, you will move to the corner corresponding with the strategy you have chosen. When you get there, you and your group members will read the one-pager that describes your strategy and complete the row of the graphic organizer in your student guide that corresponds with your strategy. | Jigsaw Materials Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Expert Groups Please move to the strategy that you will become an expert on. (Note: Prepare corners in advance so that each has a visible sign with one of the strategy names.)  S: (Move to their assigned corner and begin working.)  T: (Circulate throughout the room to ensure that students are understanding their strategy. Provide feedback and follow-up questions as necessary to ensure that each expert group understands their strategy.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Home Groups T: Now that you have become an expert on your strategy, return to your home group. In your home groups, take turns teaching one another about your strategy. You should provide your classmates with notes to complete the rest of the graphic organizer.   S: (Return to home groups and share information with one another.)  T: (Circulate throughout the room to ensure that students are understanding each strategy. Provide feedback and follow-up questions as necessary to ensure that each home group understands all strategies.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | T: Now that you understand the strategies, it is time to apply them to some scenarios. With your group, read the 4 strategies in the practice activity located in your student guide. Determine which strategy the teacher should use and why.   S: (Work with their home groups to identify appropriate strategies and explain reasoning. Complete the activity in the student guide.) | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Debrief T: Let’s review the answers. We’ll have a different group provide their answer to each scenario. Who would like to give us your answer for the first scenario?  S: (Volunteer responses. Make corrections in their student guide as necessary.)  T: (Continue to call on different groups for each scenario. Use the Student Guide – Answer Key to guide the discussion and check responses.)  T: What are some things a teacher should consider when determining what kind of formative assessment, they’d like to use?   S: Whether students will work alone or in groups, whether the content is the assessment priority, whether there is more than one appropriate answer. | Student Guide |
