Intro to Modeling a Lesson
Write the definition and notes for each term below as they are discussed in the lesson.

Success Criteria
Criteria for successful modeling:







Practice #1 - Video Example of Modeling
Watch an example of modeling in a 2nd grade math class. As you watch, find evidence of successful modeling based on the criteria we discussed and record evidence of the success criteria in the chart below. Then, consider how the model was related to the objective, how the students were engaged in learning, and what the teacher’s role was.

Objective: Students will use math drawings to represent equal groups and relate to repeated addition.


How was the model related to the objective?






How were the students engaged in learning?






What was the teacher’s role?





Practice #2 - Nonexample of Modeling
Evaluate the teacher’s delivery of the model based on the success criteria.
