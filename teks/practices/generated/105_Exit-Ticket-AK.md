## Exit Ticket - Answer Key

### Lesson 1.05: Planning and Delivering Effective Directions

Name:
Date:
Question 1:
Students in Ms. West’s 3rd grade class are wrapping up an art activity before lunch. Students have markers and scissors scattered on their workspaces. Ms. West is going to visit each workspace to collect the materials. She would like students to have these materials ready for her to collect. She would also like individual students to be responsible for cleaning up their workspaces by throwing away scraps of paper on their way to lining up at the door.
What directions should Ms. West give her students?
Student answers may vary but may include:
Return the markers to their boxes.
Put marker boxes and scissors in the left-hand corner or your workspace.
Pick up your trash.
Throw your trash in the trashcan on your way towards the door.
Line up at the door for lunch.
Question 2:
Student in Ms. East’s Biology class have been working independently to finish up lab reports. As the end of the class approaches, she asks them to turn in the reports before they leave, mark any areas of the report where they still have questions with a question mark, and think about the part of the report that is most well-written.
Her students are confused about what they are supposed to do. Circle one characteristic of effective directions and describe how the directions could be modified to better reflect that characteristic.
Specific				Sequential			Observable
Student answers may vary but may include:
If they circled specific: She tells them how to turn in their lab reports, for example, by putting them in a basket at the front of the room.
If they circled sequential: She gives them the directions in the order in which they need to complete them, for example, they need to add question marks to the report before they turn it in.
If they circled observable: She asks them to write down the part of the lab report that they did best in an exit ticket.
