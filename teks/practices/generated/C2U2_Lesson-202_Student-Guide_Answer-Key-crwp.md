| Establishing Boundaries | Show professionalism in how you communicate, behave, and present yourself | As a teacher, you are an adult and an authority figure.  Do not try to be the “cool” teacher or your students’ friend. Set boundaries with students that promote safety and professionalism Examples: dress professionally, use appropriate language, avoid “too much information” from you or your students, honor personal space and privacy |
| Calm Demeanor | Demeanor refers to a way of behaving. A teacher’s behavior directly impacts the behavior and culture of the class   Maintaining a calm attitude throughout the school day is a choice teachers make before students arrive. | Take a breath and stay calm instead of getting angry at students who didn’t listen to instructions. |
| Consistency | Consistency builds trust in the teacher and in the classroom operations Apply rules, routines, and procedures equitably Follow through on ALL your commitments to students | If you promised no homework on Fridays, do not give homework on Fridays |
| High Expectations | Establishing trusting relationships with students earns the right to demand engagement and effort. | Ask higher-order questions (how & why) and wait for responses Break challenging content into smaller chunks, work with students until they master it. Encourage productive struggle—don’t give away answers |
