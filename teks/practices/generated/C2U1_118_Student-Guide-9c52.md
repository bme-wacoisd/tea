| --- | --- | --- |
| Emotional Constancy: Manage your tone and body language to keep the Do It Again neutral or positive. A smile reassures your class: mistakes are part of learning, and you are fulfilling your commitment to always help students be their best selves. |  |  |
| Economy of Language: Use as few words as possible to lead the class through the Do It Again so their focus stays on the content and your Do It Again doesn’t turn into a lecture. |  |  |
