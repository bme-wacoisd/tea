| Rationale/ Summary | Feedback informs a student about the student’s performance relative to learning goals and outcomes. Creating opportunities for students to receive feedback that is meaningful, specific, and timely allows students to determine their learning strengths and utilize feedback to improve future learning and performance. Teachers can provide feedback informally, formally, verbally or written depending on the purpose of the feedback in the learning process. In this lesson, students will identify different types of feedback and their uses in the classroom as well as define and describe the key characteristics of effective feedback. | Feedback informs a student about the student’s performance relative to learning goals and outcomes.

| 3 mins | Bellringer The concept of effective feedback was introduced in the science of learning unit. Use what you remember from the unit to answer the following questions: How does feedback improve learning?  What are some key elements of effective feedback? | 9.01 Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Bellringer Review T: How does feedback improve learning based on what you know from the science of learning? S: Feedback helps students to figure out what they know and do not know. Specific feedback can help students to know how they can improve. T: We discussed four key characteristics to effective feedback. Can anyone remember what they are? S: Feedback should be specific and clear, focus on the task not the student, provide strengths and areas to improve and be timely. |  |
| 10 mins | Introduction to the Types of Feedback  T: Feedback can take different forms depending on when it is delivered, how it is delivered, and the purpose for the feedback. T: First, feedback can be formal or informal. Formal feedback is provided by the teacher after the task has been completed. The feedback outlines performance against standards. This feedback is scheduled and systematic. It is provided consistently to all students by the teacher. What might be an example of formal feedback? S: Project grade using rubric at the end of a unit. T: Yes, grades on projects, tests and summative assessments and report cards are places where you receive formal feedback. How might formal feedback differ from informal feedback? S: It would be less formal, maybe in the moment. T: Yes, informal feedback is not planned. It is provided during instruction to help to move instruction forward. Generally, the teacher verbally provides it. This type of feedback happens in the moment and is not provided consistently to each student. Where might you have received informal feedback from a teacher? S: While I was practicing working a math problem in class. The teacher looked to see what I was doing wrong and helped me fix the problem. T: Yes, that is the type of in the moment feedback that allows students to get back on track with their learning. Feedback also can come in written or verbal form. Written feedback is more formal by nature because it is written down and recorded for the student after a task has been completed. It helps students to know what they have done well relating to success criteria and how they can improve. Where have you received written feedback before? S: I gave a presentation, and my teacher gave me feedback on that presentation using a rubric. T: Yes, because that feedback was given after a task, was written down, and gave you feedback against a set of success criteria in the rubric that is an example of written feedback. How might written feedback be different from verbal feedback? S: Verbal feedback is spoken. T: Yes, verbal feedback is spoken and generally happens more in the moment. This allows for the feedback to be almost instantaneous and tailored to a specific student need or situation. It also allows for more dialogue or explanation if the student does not understand or has questions about the feedback given. Where have you received or experienced verbal feedback from your teacher? S: Maybe when a teacher circulates around the room when students are independently working. T: Yes, because verbal feedback happens in the moment, circulating and checking on student progress and providing feedback is a great example. This ensures that students can continue to make progress to keep the learning moving forward. T: Remember that the point of providing feedback is helping students to improve their understanding or work. Regardless of the type of feedback given to students, it still needs to align with the characteristics of effective feedback we discussed at the beginning of class. As a review those characteristics are: Specific and clear Focused on the task not the student. Provides strengths and areas for improvement. Timely and actionable T:  We spent some time in the Science of Learning unit talking about the characteristics of effective feedback. When thinking about the type of feedback to give, it is important to consider the purpose of feedback and the timeliness. Research shows that feedback that is timely and actionable has the greatest impact on learning. | PPT Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Feedback Example  T: We are going to watch a video clip of a teacher providing feedback. As you watch the clip, consider what type of feedback is given (verbal vs. written, formal vs. informal) and write down the feedback statements she makes in the chart under Example: Feedback on your student guide.  S: (Locate Example: Feedback on student guide.)  T: (Play video from 10:00-11:55.)  T: What type of feedback did the teacher provide to the student? Informal or formal? Written or verbal?  S: It was informal and verbal.  T:  What was an example of a feedback statement the teacher used with the student?   S: “I want to point out and brag on my friend Landon because when he was drawing his circles, he made sure not to put them too close together.” Or “He used his pointing finger to count so he didn’t lose track.”     T:  What was the instructional purpose for providing this feedback to the student?  S: The teacher was providing feedback to the student about what he did right in the example.  T: Yes, in this case she was affirming his actions to reinforce good practices. In sharing the feedback in front of the class, she was reinforcing these practices for the students as well. How does this feedback align to the characteristics of effective feedback we just discussed?  S: The feedback was specific and clear. It focused on the task that Landon completed, not on him. It also was timely.  T: Why was the informal, verbal feedback the right choice for the teacher to provide in this example?  S:  The verbal feedback was quick and allowed the learning to move forward.  T: Exactly. The teacher’s feedback was done in the moment and was dependent upon the immediate needs of the students to move learning forward. | Teacher Video: Kinder Math Hernandez (Timestamp 10:00-11:55)  Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Practice: Types of Feedback  T: Now you will work with a partner to analyze two additional scenarios.  In each scenario you will first decide the type of feedback that was given and then look for evidence of how the feedback aligns to the characteristics of effective feedback we have discussed. (Assign students to groups of 2. Make sure each group has a computer to watch the video in scenario 2.)   S: (Move to assigned partner groups.)  T: You will have 12 minutes to complete this task. Please locate the scenarios and corresponding questions on your student guide under Practice: Types and Characteristics of Effective Feedback. You may begin. (Set 12-minute timer.)  S: (Work in groups to complete task.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: What type of feedback was provided in scenario 1 in your practice?  S: The feedback was formal and written.  T: How do you know?  S: It was given to Tomas written down on a rubric after the completion of a task.  T: How did the feedback that was given to Tomas align to the characteristics of effective feedback?  S: Tomas got the feedback right after class, so it was timely. The feedback told him what he did right, how he could improve and was aligned to specific criteria with the “I can” targets.   T: Yes, the feedback was specific and clear, timely and actionable, focused on the task and identified his strengths and areas to improve. What about scenario 2 with Mrs. Foglesong. What kind of feedback did she give in the video and how do you know?  S: Her feedback was informal and verbal. She circulated around the room and gave feedback to students who needed it but not everyone.   T: How did her feedback align to the characteristics of effective feedback?  S: She gave feedback on what the students did well and how to improve. She used the acronym to give feedback on how to improve. Since the feedback was given on the spot, the students were able to fix their errors immediately and improve.  T: Yes. Remember that the point of feedback is to help students improve. The type of feedback that is given can depend on the purpose of the feedback, when it is given and how it is delivered. Regardless of the type, all feedback should align to the criteria for effective feedback of being specific and clear, be focused on the task, identify strengths and improvements, and be timely and actionable. |  |
