| Rationale/ Summary | Feedback informs a student and/or teacher about the student’s performance relative to learning goals and outcomes. Creating opportunities for students to receive feedback that is meaningful, specific, and timely allows students to determine their learning strengths and utilize feedback to improve future learning and performance. Formal feedback provides an opportunity for the student and teacher to step back and assess the progress of a student in attaining or mastering learning goals. In this lesson students will discuss the practice of utilizing one-on-one student conferences as a way of giving formal verbal feedback. Students will practice planning and preparing for a 1:1 conference with a student using the student conferences planning document. | Feedback informs a student and/or teacher about the student’s performance relative to learning goals and outcomes.

| 2 mins | Bellringer In unit 8, you were introduced to the concept of student conferences. In that that unit, one of the characteristics of a student conference was that they included attention to the student’s emotions about learning. Why is it important to attend to student emotions in conferences, especially when giving feedback? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Review T: In unit 8, you were introduced to student conferences. What are some of the characteristics that you remember about student conferences? S: Conferences should be brief, attend to student emotions about learning, provide an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning, focus on strengths and areas of improvement and end with goal-setting and next steps. T: Why is it important to attend to student emotions in conferences, especially when giving feedback? S: Getting feedback can sometimes be scary or feel uncomfortable, especially if the student is not confident about their learning. It is important to know this as a teacher because it can affect student motivation and how they receive the feedback. T: Yes, giving feedback requires setting the right purpose and context for the feedback. We will explore that more in our lesson today. |  |
| 10 mins | Communicating Feedback T: (Display 9.04 PPT.) Please locate the communicating feedback section on your student guide. You can take notes in this section as we discuss communicating feedback. S: (Locate Communicating Feedback section on 9.4 student guide.) T: We discussed in the previous lesson that feedback can take different forms depending on when it is delivered, how it is delivered, and the purpose for the feedback. Today we will discuss why it is important to set the right context for feedback to ensure that students receive it in a way to help them achieve their best. T: As we discussed in the bellringer today, the way that feedback is presented can impact how it is received. Sometimes even well-meaning feedback can come across the wrong way and reduce a learner’s motivation.  T: Creating an environment where feedback is given and received often, both informally and formally makes feedback a normal part of the class culture. T: It is important for teachers to create a safe environment for feedback to be given and received, frame the purpose of the feedback, and clearly articulate the process and how the feedback can help them improve. Do you think it is easier to receive formal feedback or informal feedback as a student? Why? S: Informal feedback is easier to receive because it does not affect our grade it just helps us to get better. T: It is important to consider that students view formal feedback as higher stakes. This requires more care and consideration as to the way feedback is delivered. One example of how formal verbal feedback is utilized in the classroom is through one-on-one student conferences. Has anyone experienced a one-on-one conference with a teacher? S: Answers will vary. T: One-on-one conferences are brief opportunities for a teacher to meet with a student to provide specific feedback about their progress toward mastering learning goals.  T:(Discuss the following points with the students), 1:1 conferences are beneficial because: They allow teachers to build on the relationships that they have with students. They provide an opportunity for teachers to address individual misunderstandings, They boost student confidence and reduce anxieties.  They provide a regular opportunity for students to share their concerns    T: In setting up conferences with students consider the following practices: Schedule conferences regularly and keep them short (5 minutes or less) Before the conference, plan out what you will share as strengths/areas of improvement. Also have the students reflect on their strengths/struggles before the conference. Share your main thoughts on their progress/work. Keep your thoughts to three points or less, starting with the positive. End with a goal that can be focused on for the next conference. | PPT Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Model-1:1 Student Conferences  T: I am going to model the process for planning a 1:1 student conference. Locate the section Model-1:1 Student Conferences in your student guide.  S: (Locate Model-1:1 Student Conferences in student guide.)  T: Please take a moment to read the scenario provided.  S: (Read Model-1:1 Student Conferences Scenario provided on student guide.)  T: The scenario mentions that I have scheduled a 1:1 conference with each of my students over the next week in class. The purpose of conference is to provide feedback on the most recent writing sample they have completed. I know that I need to keep the conferences short, so I have created a conference planning document. Let us look at the planning document.  S: (Look at planning document included on student guide.)  T: What do you notice about the planning document?  S: The document has a  place to include strengths and areas for improvement. It also allows the teacher to take notes on concerns/struggles that the student may have. having.  T: Why do you think it is important to have a planning document?  S: The different categories help to keep the conference on track. It also could make sure the teacher shares strengths as well as areas for improvement.  T: Yes. And having the skills section makes sure that we are focusing on the skills or the task, not the student personally. In the scenario the skills to be focused on are argumentative writing, organization of writing, supporting claims with evidence, using appropriate spelling/punctuation/grammar in writing.   T: The next step is to plan out the specific feedback to provide the student, starting with the strengths. Due to the brevity of the conference, consider sharing three points or less. Based on the scenario, what is a strength that could be shared with Roberta? S: She established a clear claim that the school should have a garden and supported it with some details from the passage.  T: Yes, that is a great starting point to the writing and a key strength to reinforce. Next, we will move to areas of improvement. Remember we want to provide just a couple of areas to focus on that are specific and actionable. Based on the scenario, what seems like the most important areas of improvement to include?  S: You could share that the fact that she added the “bad” things distracted the reader from the claim. Also, instead of leaving the “choice” to the principal, she could restate her claim in the conclusion.  T: Great! Those are both specific and actionable pieces of feedback. The next step in the conference would be to allow the student to share areas of concern or struggle. The planning document includes a space for the teacher to record that information from the student.  T: The last step is to set some goals with the student at the end of the conference. The goals likely are going to be related to the improvement feedback the student received. What is a goal that the teacher could set with Roberta?  S: Maybe to work on her conclusions?  T: Yes, again we want to identify a goal that is brief and actionable. In this case Roberta could work on supporting her claims by including more evidence and strengthening her conclusions by restating and supporting the claim. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice-Planning for 1:1 Conferences  T: You will now work to plan a 1:1 conference with a student using the planning document. Please locate the scenario and planning document in the Practice-Planning for 1:1 Conferences section of your student guide.  S: (Locates Practice Section on student guide.)  T: You have been provided a scenario to help you plan for the conference. Please read the scenario now. (Set timer for 2 minutes.)  S: (Students read Practice scenario.)  T: You will use the information in the scenario to plan for the conference. You will have 5 minutes to consider the feedback you will share and set a goal for the next conference. After planning, you will have five minutes to share your plan with a partner. What questions do you have about the scenario?  S: (Ask questions for clarification.)  T: You may begin planning now. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S: (Plan for conference using scenario.)  T: Now that you have had time to plan, please share your plan with a partner. As you share, your partner should be looking to see that the feedback meets the characteristics for effective feedback. Does anyone remember what the characteristics of effective feedback are?  S: Feedback that is specific and clear, focused on the task, identifies strengths and areas for improvement and is timely and actionable.  T: Yes. You have 5 minutes to share your plan and make suggestions for improvement. Find a partner and begin sharing now. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S: (Share feedback and plan with a partner.)  T: Now that you have had time to receive feedback, make any adjustments to the plan based on what your partner shared with you. In the next class, we will use these planning documents to role play a conference between Mr. Blankenship and Shawn. You have 2 minutes to adjust. (Set 2 minute timer.) S: (Adjust planning document based on feedback.) |  |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: What are some benefits of holding 1:1 conference with students?  S: Allows for 2-way communication of feedback which can alleviate misunderstandings, build student confidence, and reduce anxieties.  T:  It is important for teachers to ensure a safe environment, so feedback is received positively. How can teachers create this safety?  S: Make sure feedback is given and received regularly and make sure the purpose & process is for feedback is clear to students.  T: When planning for a 1:1 conference, what are some things teachers should keep in mind?  S: Conferences should be short, and students should do some reflection on the task ahead of the conference. It is also important to keep feedback to a minimum and share both strengths and areas for improvement. |  |
