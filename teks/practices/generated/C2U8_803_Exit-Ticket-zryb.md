Read the following scenarios and determine which is more likely to foster student engagement. Explain your reasoning and tell why the use of multiple forms of engagement is important to student learning.

Scenario 1: Ms. C. is about to begin a unit on animals and their life cycles. She asks students to vote on which animal they would like to learn more about. The top 3 votes in the room were frogs, horses, and snakes. Ms. C. begins preparing a unit on animal life cycles focusing on frogs, horses, and snakes.  She plans to take her students on a field trip to the local children’s museum where they can learn more about these different animals. Afterwards, she has students create a class book to explain what they learned about each animal and its life cycle. At the end of the project, Ms. C. ask students to share one important thing they learned.
Scenario 2: Mrs. H. is also beginning a unit on animals and their life cycles. She asks students to choose an animal they would like to learn more about during this unit and decide if they would like to work individually or with a partner. Mrs. H. provides students with a playlist of tools and resources on various levels that they can use to learn more about their chosen animal, such as books, videos, photographs, podcasts, etc. Mrs. H. plans to give students a choice in how they present their learning on their animal, either through a brochure, video presentation, poster, PowerPoint or model. At the end of the project, Mrs. H. ask students to reflect on their learning through an “I use to think… Now I think…” prompt to share how their understanding of life cycles progressed from the beginning of the unit to now.
