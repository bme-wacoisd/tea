Answers will vary.

Metacognition:

Thinking about ones thinking

Benefits of Metacognition:

Improves student learning.
enhances:

personal ability to self-regulate our thinking and motivation.




Teacher Model (Think Aloud)
Listen as the teacher uses metacognitive strategies to make sense of an image. When you hear a metacognitive strategy used, raise your hand. Use the graphic organizer below to record information about each use of a metacognitive strategy.

#### Practice: Partner Think-Aloud

Listen as your partner uses metacognitive strategies to make sense of an image. Track the strategies used, whether they were used, what they sounded like, and how they helped understanding. Be prepared to share what you heard with your partner.


| Strategy | Related Questions |
| --- | --- |
| planning how to approach new tasks or information | What’s my purpose or goal? Where should I start? What obstacles might I encounter and how can I plan to avoid them? |
| identifying and planning for challenges | What might be hard for me? What are some strategies for moving forward? |
| consulting prior knowledge | What do I know about this already? How can I use what I know to make predictions or inferences? |
| evaluating your progress | Where am I in the process? How am I doing? Am I on track? |
| monitoring comprehension | Am I understanding? Where might I be getting stuck? What do I need to do to get unstuck? |
| using images | What does this image add to my understanding of the text? How might I visualize what is being said? |


| Metacognitive Strategies | Where was it used? What did it sound like? | Why do you think it helped to understand? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning how to approach new tasks or new information. | At the beginning – “Where should I start? With the title.”    When deciding where to go after the title. “I’ll start in the bottom left corner.” | Knowing to begin with the title helped see the big picture to help make sense of the details.   Provides a process and a focus for building understanding. |
| Identifying and planning for challenges | At the beginning – “This looks like a challenging task.”    When looking at the arrows in the middle and righthand side of the page – “There are a lot of arrows. Let me see what I can make sense of.” | Acknowledgement of challenge allows student to plan for obstacles to understanding, leads to less frustration.  Acknowledging the number of arrows, which may be a challenge, can help minimize frustration. “Let me see what I can make sense of” helps focus on one step at a time. |
| Consulting prior knowledge | After reading the title and encountering a new word (mangrove)    While looking at the image of the tree      When making sense of the dots in the water as well as the arrows | Using an understanding of another word in the title helped makes sense of the big picture even if there was an unknown word.  Helped identify differences between the mangrove and other trees that are more familiar. The differences may be important in understanding the specific ecosystem.  Using prior knowledge can help make inferences, predictions, and guesses that can help fill gaps. |
| Evaluating your progress | When making sense of the arrows – It’s confusing but I’m making good progress on my understanding. I’m going to see if I can figure it out on my own before I ask for help. | Checking in on progress to be sure you are not frustrated helps tackle challenging problems |
| Monitoring comprehension | After noticing differences between the mangrove and other trees   In making sense of the arrows. “Some are dotted. I’m not sure why.”   When making sense of the arrows – “If my thinking is correct. . . “ “It doesn’t explain to me. . . “ | Writing down questions to ask for later can help ensure understanding.  Acknowledging a gap in understanding can help a student ask a helpful, focused question.  Provides an opportunity to confirm understanding and ask a focused question. |
| Using images | After readding the title and encountering a new word (mangrove) | Using the image helped confirm the guess about the new word. |


| What strategy was used? | Where was it used? What did it sound like? | Why do you think it helped to understand? |
