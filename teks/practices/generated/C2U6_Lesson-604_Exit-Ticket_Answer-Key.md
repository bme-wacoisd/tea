### Lesson 6.04: Standard & Objective Alignment

Name:
Date:
A student moves to a new school in the same state mid-year. Explain why the use of consistent state standards is beneficial in this situation.
Standards inform everyone involved in a student’s education—teachers at all grade levels and content areas, principals, parents, students, etc.—what a student should know and be able to do at each grade level. This means that if a student changes teachers or moves to a new Texas public school, they will still have the same learning goals for the year. Standards keep learning consistent throughout the state.

Read the standard below and circle the objectives that most closely align to the standard.
