Rationale:
This statement is not a quality I can statement because it includes multiple skills.  The language may also be difficult for a student to understand.
- How does using a strategy such as writing “I can” statements help teachers to communicate learning expectations to students?
It helps students to know what to expect throughout the lesson as well as what they will need to learn and be able to do at the end of the lesson. By making them visible to students, it allows students to take ownership of their learning and monitor progress toward the accomplishment of the skills/concepts.
