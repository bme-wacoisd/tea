#### Family Interview Analysis


Ms. Grey:  What are some examples of ways that you prefer to be involved with your child’s classroom?
Marco’s Mom:  We are happy to occasionally provide needed school supplies.  I may be able to chaperone at certain events or field trips.  If there is ever a bake sale to raise funds, I make fabulous baked goods!  In fact, our family owns and operates a little coffee shop and bakery on the east side of town.  We use old family recipes!
Ms. Grey:  What suggestions do you have or what additional opportunities would you like to be connected to your child’s classroom?
Marco’s Dad:  I’d love to join the class and lead a read aloud like we did with our son’s class last year to share a bit about our family and share one of our favorite stories.  Or maybe something like last year’s social studies project, where student’s shared about their family customs and traditions.  Anything along those lines!
Marco’s Mom:  It would be great if there was a way that we might be able to connect with other parents in our son’s class.  It’s always helpful to know more about our Marco’s peers and build relationships outside of school.
Ms. Grey:  What are Marco’s interests and strengths?
Marco’s Mom:  Marco is a strong and avid reader.  He also likes art and, of course, video games.  He does like to be challenged, but he can also become easily frustrated.  Marco needs reassurance that when he does not succeed the first time, that it is okay to learn from these experiences and strive for improvement.
Marco’s Dad:  Yes, he often does not want to hear advice from us as his parents, but I’ve noticed that Marco will listen and respond to input from other adults, like his soccer coach or cub scouts den leader.  Marco is a smart boy, and he learns quickly but needs to learn how to become more patient and resilient.  He may be a bit of a perfectionist!
Ms. Grey:  I think you’ve touched on this, but what does Marco struggle with?
Marco’s Dad:  Besides becoming a more resilient individual, Marco can be easily distracted by his peers, which can lead to off task behavior.  I think he tends to have the most success in well-managed classrooms, with limited distractions.
Marco’s Mom:  Yes, but we don’t mean to put this all on the teacher.  We have been working with our son on how to ignore distractions and remain focused on his work.  He gets frustrated when there are distractions.
Ms. Grey:  What are your hopes and dreams for your Marco?
Marco’s Dad:  I hope that he will follow in our footsteps and become a successful entrepreneur, an independent business owner.
Marco’s Mom:  That’s right, from a very young age we have always tried to instill in our son a strong work ethic, at home, helping us at work, and at school.  We want Marco to be a successful student.
Marco’s Dad:  Yes, I hope that he will pursue a college degree in business and someday run his own company, whatever that may be.
Ms. Grey:  What do you see as a strength of your family?
Marco’s Mom:  Again, our strong work ethic, our belief in the value of education, doing a good job, helping others, and serving our community.  In addition, to running our bakery, we are very committed to the community and do a great deal of charitable work.  We like to do things together, as a family, whether it’s going to a park or museum on the weekend or just taking a walk around the neighborhood after dinner each day.
Marco’s Dad:  Yes, these are things we want to model and instill upon Marco.  Please let us know if you ever notice a shift away from the values that we uphold in our home.  We want to be involved in our son’s education and we are committed to supporting his growth.
Ms. Grey:  What are your preferred ways to be communicated with from your child’s teacher/school? Face to face? Website? Newsletter? Email? Text?
Marco’s Mom:  Email is probably best, but text is the quickest way to get ahold of either of us.
