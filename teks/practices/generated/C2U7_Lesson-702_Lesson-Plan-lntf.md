| 3 mins | Bellringer Students in Ms. Zimmer’s 5th grade class sees the information below posted on the board. Lesson Standard:  RL.5.1 Quote accurately from a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. Learning Outcomes: I can accurately find the words or phrases from texts that supports my answer. I can make logical conclusions based on the evidence in the text. I can create lists of clues stated in the text to support my inference. Daily Agenda: Daily Warm-up Vocabulary Review Teacher Model – Passage 1  Individual practice – Passage 2 & 3 Homework: Passage 4 & 5  Why did Ms. Zimmer post this information on the board for students to see at the beginning of the class? How does it help students to understand what they need to know and be able to do in today’s lesson? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Bellringer Review T: Let’s look at your bellringer activity.  Why do you think Ms. Zimmer took the time to post all this information on the board for students?  S: (Answers will vary.) It helps students to know what to expect throughout the lesson as well as what they will need to learn and be able to do at the end of the lesson.  T:  How does the information on the board help students to know what they will need to know and be able to do?  S: (Answers will vary.) The lesson standard shows the purpose of the lesson, the I can statements clearly explain what students need to do in the lesson and the agenda helps to show them how they will learn it or practice it. |  |
| 5 mins | Introduction to Making Instructional Outcomes Clear  T: In our previous lesson, you were able to explore high leverage teaching practices. Focusing on instructional outcomes in a lesson was one of those high leverage strategies. Why is focusing on instructional outcomes important for students?  S: Students need to be clear about what is important to learn and what is expected of them. Teachers need to be clear about what success looks like for students too.  T: Focusing on Instructional Outcomes is beneficial for the students as well as for the teacher. Here are a few ways that instructional outcomes are beneficial to the classroom. How Focusing on Instructional Outcomes Benefits Students Communicates what students need to know and be able to do. Provides criteria for success in instructional tasks. Helps to ensure that students are focusing on the most important content. How Focusing on Instructional Outcomes Benefits Teachers Helps to make sure activities and practice are aligned to learning outcomes. Ensure that all students are challenged by learning outcomes. T: Teachers can make the instructional outcomes clear for students by: Making the instructional outcomes visible for students Reviewing instructional outcomes with students at the beginning of the lesson Returning to the instructional outcomes throughout the lesson as a formative check Reviewing the instructional outcomes at the conclusion of the lesson  T: One strategy a teacher can use to make the instructional outcomes clear to students is through the development of “I can” statements. Where have you seen “I can” statements before?  S: Ms. Zimmer used “I can” statements in the bellringer example we looked at today.  T: Yes, “I can” statements are a way that a teacher can communicate learning intentions to students. They are written in student-friendly language and describe exactly what students will be expected to learn during a lesson. When posted on the board like in our bellringer example, I can statements serve as a visual reminder to students and help students to take ownership of their learning and track and monitor their progress toward the desired learning outcomes.  T:  Quality “I can” statements  Use student-friendly language. Focus on one key skill or concept. Are measurable. | PPT Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Example/Non-Example of “I Can” Statements  T: Let’s look at an “I can” statement from the bellringer: “I can accurately find the words or phrases from texts that supports my answer.”  This is a statement made for Ms. Zimmer’s 5th grade class. Is it student-friendly? How do we know?  S: Yes. It is written in language that a 5th grade student would understand. T:  Does it focus on one skill or concept? S: Yes. The skill is finding words/phrases from the text that support the answer. T:  How do we know if it is measurable? S: A teacher can see the student demonstrating this skill by having the student to write the words/phrases from the text that support the student’s answer.  T: Now let’s look at a non-example of a quality “I can” statement from an elementary art classroom: “I can use more complex media to express an idea and expand my knowledge of the tools and techniques with attention to craftsmanship.”  T: Does this “I can” statement use student-friendly language?  S: No, the “I can” statement uses terms like “complex media” or “attention to craftsmanship” that might be unclear to students.  T:  Does this “I can” statement focus on one key skill or concept?  S: No, it mentions that students will use more complex media to express ideas and expand the knowledge of tools and techniques and improve craftmanship.  T: Is this measurable?  S: Maybe? It’s tough to know by the way that it is written.  T: Yes, sometimes it can be unclear if the statement is based on progress rather than a single measurement, however, if the standard indicates the need for progress, then it may be necessary for the teacher to clarify how it will be measured. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Introduction to Writing Quality “I Can” Statements  T: Writing quality “I can” statements takes practice. There is a process that we can use to make writing “I can” statements easier.  Start with the standard: Determine what instructional standard you will focus on during the lesson. Break the standard apart into smaller, measurable skills. Describe each skill in a statement beginning with the phrase “I can” that uses language appropriate for the level of students. | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Writing “I Can” Statements  T:  Let’s look at a standard from first grade math.  The teacher has already determined that students will only focus on analog clocks during this lesson.  Lesson objective:    Tell and write time in hours and half-hours using analog and digital clocks.  T: Let’s first think about the skills that are required by this standard and list them out.  What are some of the skills required by this standard? (Keep asking for skills until all skills are named by students.)  S: (May list these in any order.) Tell time to the hour by an analog clock, write time to the hour using analog clock, tell time to the half hour using an analog clock, write time to the half hour using an analog clock.  T: Now we need to write these into statements starting with “I can.”  They might look like:  I can tell time to the hour on an analog clock.  I can write time for the hour on an analog clock.  I can tell time to the half-hour on an analog clock.  I can write time to the half-hour on an analog clock.   T:  Now check to see if these statements are in student-friendly language. Do you think the language used in these statements could be understood by a 1st grade student?  S: Yes, these are written in student-friendly language. The words used would be familiar to a student in that class. | Student Guide |
| 15  min | Practice:  Writing “I Can” Statements  T: Now you will get the chance to practice writing “I can” statements with a partner. Locate the practice section on your student guide.  S: (Locate practice example.)   T: With a partner you will select one of the instructional standards provided. Based on that standard you will work with your partner to write “I can” statements that represent the desired instructional outcomes.  You will have 7 minutes to draft the statements. At the conclusion of the 7 minutes, you will find another pair of students to create a group of 4 students. Each pair will share their drafted “I can” statements while the other pair listens, looking for evidence of quality “I can” statements. The group of 4 will then take 2 minutes to discuss whether the “I can” statements meet the success criteria. (Display a timer for 7 minutes.)  S: (Students write “I can” statements.)   T: Pair up with another group to create a group of 4. Share your “I can” statements with each other for 1 minute. Then use the remaining two minutes to provide feedback on the statements based on the criteria for quality “I can” statements. (Display a timer for 3 minutes.)  S: (First pair of students share their statements. Feedback provided by other students in the group.)  T: Now switch so the other pair shares their “I can” statements and receives feedback. (Display a timer for 3 minutes.)  S: (Second pair of students share their statements. Feedback provided by other students in the group.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: How did you do write “I can” statements? Did you find it to be hard or easy?  S: (Answers will vary.) Breaking the skills apart was easy but making sure to make each statement measurable was harder to do.   T:  What were the criteria for quality “I can” statements that we discussed?  S: The statement must be written in student-friendly language, represent a single skill or concept, and be measurable.  T:  How can “I can” statements be used to help teachers focus on instructional outcomes in the classroom?  S: Writing the statements on the board helps students to know what they need to know and be able to do. The fact that they are measurable helps students to know what is expected for success. It helps students to focus and own their learning throughout the lesson.   T: When should “I can” statements be used in a lesson?  S: They should be visible throughout the lesson, explained at the beginning, returned to during the lesson (as students achieve each target), and reviewed at the conclusion of the lesson. | Student Guide |
