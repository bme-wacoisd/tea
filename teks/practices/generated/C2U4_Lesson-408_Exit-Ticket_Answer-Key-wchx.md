Date:
Examine Module 1 - Lesson 3.1 from 3rd Grade Eureka Math – Understand equal groups of as multiplication (Teacher Guide Pages 23-33). Identify how the lesson requires cognitive engagement and record your evidence below.



| Activity/Task | Evidence of Cognitive Engagement |
| --- | --- |
| Students choose to use a strip diagram or a number bond to model the problem – Math club is offered to all third and fourth graders. There are 83 third graders and 76 fourth graders in math club. How many total students are in math club? | Students use a strip diagram or number bond to organize information in the application problem. |
| Students use the Read, Draw, Write (RDW) process for problem solving. | Students use the RDW process to read the problem, draw and label a model of the problem to solve (organize), and write an equation and a sentence to explain the reasoning (why/how) behind their answer. |
| Turn and Talk: How do you think 6x2=12 relates to the other number sentences? | Students must make a comparison and explain their thinking to a partner. |
| Look at my new drawing and the multiplication sentence I wrote to represent it. Check my work by writing an addition sentence and counting to find the total number of objects. Use your addition sentence as you talk to your partner about why you agree or disagree with my work. | Students must assess the teacher’s work to determine if she was correct by writing an addition sentence. Students then must use that addition sentence to make an argument about why the teacher’s work was correct or incorrect. |
