This lesson uses only examples to teach the concept of partitioning a whole into fractions.
- Identify two examples used in the plan.
- Suggest a specific nonexample the teacher could use to build understanding.
- Describe how the teacher could help students understand the connections and differences between the examples and nonexamples.





| Examples used in the lesson plan  Shows example of pizza cut into halves Shows example of pizza cut into fourths and eighths Models an example of how to partition shapes into half, fourth, and eighths |
| --- |
| Specific nonexample the teacher could use to build understanding: The teacher could show a pizza cut into unequal pieces as a nonexample of partitioning or fractions. |
| Describe how the teacher could help students understand the connections and differences between the examples and nonexamples The teacher could help students understand that although a pizza is cut into 4 pieces, if they aren’t in 4 equal parts, it isn’t a fraction since each fractional part must be equal. The teacher could also help students see that a pizza cut in half, cut into fourths, etc. is still a whole, just the whole has now been cut into pieces. |
