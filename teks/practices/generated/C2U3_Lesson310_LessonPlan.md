| 5 mins | Bellringer:  What are some ways that teachers can learn more about students’ funds of knowledge? Why is it important for teachers to develop their knowledge of students’ funds of knowledge? What are some ways that teachers can use their knowledge of students’ funds of knowledge to design instruction? | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 Mins | T: Let’s discuss our bellringer responses.  What are some ways that teachers may become more familiar with their students’ funds of knowledge?   S: (Raise hands to volunteer responses.)  T: (Call on students to share responses, including home visits, family interviews, weekly emails/updates, student-generated photo essays or journals, inviting families on field trips, to class events, to student presentations, using communication apps and family communication tracking logs.)    T: Yes, and why is it important for teachers to learn about students’ funds of knowledge?  S: Because it makes students feel seen. To help teachers design instruction that reflects the students’ backgrounds and interests.  T: That’s right!  In what ways might teachers use their familiarity with students’ funds of knowledge to make, select, or justify instructional decisions?  S: (Raise hands to volunteer responses.)   T: (Call on students to share, affirming responses that touch on the integration of funds of knowledge for intentional grouping, providing relevant examples, creating meaningful activities, facilitating pertinent classroom discussions, and capitalizing on students’ strengths, interests, and curiosities.)  Direct Teach  T: Very good! So having knowledge of what your students bring to the classroom, through things like family interviews and communication tracking logs, can help you in making instructional design decisions, including intentional grouping, providing relevant examples, creating meaningful activities, facilitating pertinent classroom discussions, and capitalizing on students’ strengths, interests, and curiosities.  T:  For example, if a student has a preference to work individually, you may need to build in some additional scaffolds or activities aimed at teaching students how to successfully collaborate with peers.   Likewise, a teacher may use data collected from family interviews and communication logs to leverage students’ cultural capital and encourage students to use their voices and share more about their unique experiences in a safe environment. Teachers can also make instructional content relevant to the collective interests of students.   T: Let’s take a closer look by analyzing a family interview scenario to see if we can determine the funds of knowledge of a student’s family. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 min | Family Interview Analysis  T:  Consider this scenario (read scenario aloud for students and share slide with scenario listed on it for students to follow along):  The school year has just begun, and Mr. Dale has all new students in his third-grade class. He is in the process of conducting both in-person and virtual family interviews to meet families and to learn more about life at home for his students. The parents of one his students, Raul, shared during their interview that while Raul likes to read, he prefers graphic novels and comic books. Raul’s parents shared with Mr. Dale that Raul is a quiet boy who likes being with friends and family. At home and at family gatherings, Spanish is the exclusive language used, but Raul speaks in both English and Spanish when he plays with his close friends.  T: Given this scenario, which we know is just a snapshot of what Mr. Dale has done to get to know his students and determine their families’ funds of knowledge, what information has he learned about Raul?  S: Mr. Dale learned that: Raul likes to read graphic novels and comic books. Raul’s parents and family members are fluent in Spanish. Raul is quiet and likes being with close friends and family. Raul speaks both English and Spanish when he plays with his close friends.  T: Good! How might Mr. Dale use that information when he’s thinking about ways to plan his classroom instruction that will be effective for Raul and probably other students, too?  S: Mr. Dale can use that information to plan for instruction by… Giving opportunities for Raul to work with a partner or in a small group of his close of friends. Sharing graphic novels and comic books with Raul  Find out more about what comic books he likes. Relate some class content to graphic novels and comics.  Asking Raul’s parents to read books and novels with him at home when they can | Student Guide PPT |
| 15 min | Practice T:  Can anyone recall our parent communication success criteria?  S:  Respect time and preferred method of contact, plan ahead, and develop a relationship with the parent/caregiver.  T:  Great, these success criteria apply to family interviews as well.  T: Now that we’ve discussed the connection between conducting family interviews to learn about students and discern their families’ funds of knowledge and teachers planning effective instruction, you will practice by independently reading and responding to a family interview transcript excerpt in your Student Guide. You will have 5 minutes to work independently before sharing with a partner.  S: (Independently work on family interview transcript excerpt in Student Guide.)  T: (Keep time on the board for students to see how much time they have remaining to work.)  T: Spend 5 minutes sharing and comparing your responses with a near neighbor. Then, we will talk about the scenario as an entire class.  S: (Share their responses with a near neighbor.)  T: Let’s spend a few minutes talking about your responses and some scenarios about how Ms. Grey could proceed in learning about her student, Marco.  First, how did you answers compare with those of your partner’s?  S: Answers will vary, but may include:   The family seems to value a strong work ethic and a sound education. The family possesses the skills and knowledge necessary of successful entrepreneurship and business ownership. The family members are proprietors of a local eatery. The family has adapted their historical and cultural values to find success and strengthen the local community, through economic development and charitable contributions. The family is close knit and enjoys spending leisure time with one another including local outings and daily strolls.  T:  Great! So, how might the Ms. Grey use data collected from this interview to make, select, or justify instructional decisions?  S:  Answers will vary, but may include: Ms. Grey may use data collected from this interview to make content contextual by integrating the student’s funds of knowledge into classroom lessons and incorporating aspects of family culture, baking, or entrepreneurship.  Ms. Grey might help students draw parallels to what they are hearing about in class and how it impacts their community today.  Ms. Grey may also use data collected from this interview to leverage cultural capital, encouraging students to use their voice and share their experiences in a safe environment. Ms. Grey may opt to allow for student voice and choice in selecting topics that they may be interested in exploring, either individually or with peers. Ms. Grey may also choose texts or topics in a given unit to highlight the different experiences of students in class. | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | Debrief T: Why is it important for teachers to take intentional time to learn about students and their families’ funds of knowledge?  S: Answers will vary but may include: It is important for teachers to learn about students and their families’ funds of knowledge because… It can help teachers plan for effective instruction in their classrooms. It can help teachers integrate of funds of knowledge into classroom activities to create richer and more-highly scaffolded and personalized learning experience for students. |  |
