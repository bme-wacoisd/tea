| 3 mins | Bellringer Describe the high leverage practice of explicit teaching.  How is modeling an example of explicit teaching? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Bellringer Review T: Yesterday we discussed the high leverage strategy of explicit teaching.  What do we mean by explicit teaching? S:  Explicit teaching guides students through the learning process, step by step, with clear explanations, procedures, and success criteria. T: Why is modeling an example of explicit teaching? S: In the key practices of effective modeling, the teacher is demonstrating the learning process and showing students what success looks like and how to achieve it. |  |
| 5 mins | Review of Key Practices for Effective Modeling  T: In the previous lesson, you saw an example of an effective model.  What the first key practice we discussed as a part of an effective model?  S: The teacher needs to break the information down into small learnable steps.  T: Yes.  The information needs to be broken down into small learnable steps to prevent cognitive overload.  What is the next key practice?  S: The teacher should provide a visual demonstration.  T: Yes, a visual demonstration is important.  The students need to see the process as it is being done.  Remember the discussion about YouTube vs the model of a process in a book?  Many of you mentioned you preferred YouTube because you could visually watch the process being done.  What is the next key practice?  S: The teacher should explain the steps   T: Yes, as the teacher is providing the visual demonstration, the teacher should be verbally explaining the steps.  This includes not just what they are doing but why it is important.  What is the next key practice?  S: The teacher should connect the steps.  T: Connecting the steps is an important part to the modeling process.  Connecting the steps means that students understand the sequence of the steps.  In addition, it is important to make connections to prior knowledge and learning.  What is the last key process for effective modeling?  S: Checking for student understanding throughout the model.  T:  Teachers should pause & check for student understanding throughout the process of modeling.  This allows opportunities for students to ask questions and get clarification and to re-model steps as necessary. | PPT  Student Guide |
| 30 mins | Practice: Modeling  T: During practice in the last lesson, you used a script to feel what the modeling process might look like.  Today, you will build on your modeling skills by creating a script for a model and delivering it to a partner.  T: Locate the Practice: Modeling section on your Student Guide.  S: (Locates Practice: Modeling section.)  T: In this section, I have provided two different modeling scenarios for you to practice.  Choose ONE of the scenarios that you wish to model to a partner.  You will have 10 minutes to develop your script for your chosen scenario and record it on your student guide.  After developing the script, you will deliver the model to a partner and receive feedback from that partner about how your model exhibited the key practices for effective modeling.  You can select your scenario and begin developing your modeling script now.  T: (Set 10-minute timer)  S: (Select scenario and write script for model.)  T: 10 minutes is up.  Please find a partner to whom to deliver your model.  Choose who will deliver their model first, and who will go second.  S: (Find a partner and select the order for delivering the model.)  T: Partner 1 will have 5 minutes to deliver their model.  At the conclusion of the 5 minutes, partner 2 will have 2 minutes to deliver feedback about the model based on evidence of the key practices.  If you finish your model before the 5 minutes is up, reflect silently as an individual on the model.  I will keep time to make sure we are able to get through both models and both rounds of feedback.  Partner 1 can begin modeling now. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S:(Partner 1 delivers the model while partner 2 is the student.)  T: 5 minutes is up.  Now partner 2, take 2 minutes to provide feedback to your partner about their model.  Remember to provide evidence about how they met or did not meet the key practices. You may begin now. (Set timer for 2 minutes.)  S: (Partner 2 provides feedback to partner 1 on their model.)  T:  Now Partner 2 will have 5 minutes to deliver their model.  At the conclusion of the 5 minutes, partner 1 will have 2 minutes to deliver feedback about the model based on evidence of the key practices.  If you finish your model before the 5 minutes is up, reflect silently as an individual on the model.  I will keep time.  Partner 2 can begin modeling now. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S:(Partner 1 delivers the model while partner 2 is the student.)  T: 5 minutes is up.  Now partner 1, take 2 minutes to provide feedback to your partner about their model.  Remember to provide evidence about how they met or did not meet the key practices. You may begin now. (Set timer for 2 minutes.)  S: (Partner 1 provides feedback to partner 2 on their model.)  T: Now you will use the feedback you just received to improve your practice. Take 2 minutes to review your feedback notes and revise your script based on the feedback that you received. (Set timer for 2 minutes.)  S: (Make revisions to script based on feedback.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T:  How did it feel for you to develop the script and deliver the model?  Was it easy or hard for you?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Based on the practice modeling with your partner, what were some of the more difficult practices to include in the model?  What made that practice harder than the others?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T:  Based on the practice modeling with your partner, what were some of the easier practices to include in the model?  What made that practice easier than the others?  S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
