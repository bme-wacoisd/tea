Read the scenario below. Identify and analyze the assessments the teacher uses. Use the graphic organizer to guide your analysis.
In a lesson about maps and how to draw maps to represent information, Mr. Hillary begins by providing his students with an image of a map and asking them to describe what they see and what they know about maps. Next, he teaches key elements of maps and then engages students in a discussion about key elements as they annotate the map together based on his questions (Where on this map do you see the legend?  How does this map show elevation?). Students then work in partners to draw their own map of the playground, ensuring that they use the essential elements of a map in their work. Finally, as an exit ticket, Mr. Hillary provides students a new map and asks them to annotate the important parts.




| Formative Assessment | Formal or Informal? | What is Assessed? | Teacher’s Possible Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description and knowledge of maps | Formal | Prior knowledge about maps | Reteach information about maps essential to the lesson if students don’t know it. Skip information about maps that students already know |
| Discussion and annotations | Informal | Current understanding of applying key elements of a map to an example | Are students ready for the next step? If so move to next activity. If not, reteach |
| Partner drawing | Formal | Understanding of applying key elements to create a map with a partner | Elements of the lesson that may need reteaching |
| Individual exit ticket | Formal | Individual understanding of maps | Strategic grouping for reteaching the next day |
