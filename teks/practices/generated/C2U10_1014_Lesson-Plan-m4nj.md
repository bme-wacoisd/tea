| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Respond to one of the following questions: Think of a time when you saw an interview and were impressed by the person being interviewed. Why were you impressed?  Why do employers conduct interviews with people when they make hiring decisions? Write about a time when you were interviewed for a job. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Notes: The Importance of Interviews T: Please set aside your bellringer. We will return to it shortly. Please find the “Notes: The Importance of Interviews” section in your Student Guide and fill in the blanks.  T: Just as you need to put your best foot forward in written form, you also need to be able to prepare and present appropriately for program and/or job interviews.  T: More than anything, an interview is an opportunity to show your best self. It takes preparation, thoughtful self-presentation, and thinking on your feet.  S: (Fill in the blanks in Student Guide.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 8 mins | Notes: Best Practices for Interviews T: Can I have two volunteers share their responses to the bellringer?  S: Responses may vary but may include: They were an expert on the topic and could answer all the questions. They spoke clearly and didn’t say “um” or “like.” They explained things in language that everyone can understand.  T: When interviewees demonstrate these characteristics, it shows that they took time to prepare to be interviewed.  T: There are some strategies for preparing for an interview for admission to a teaching program or a job. Fill in the strategies in the chart in your Student Guide.  T: First, you should research the position and school and/or program. You want it to be clear that you took the time to learn more about the opportunity because it shows that you are truly interested.  T: Second, you want to plan out what you want the interviewers to know about you. Some questions to think about are:  What am I passionate about? What am I good at? Why am I a good fit for this program or job?  T: Third, you want to plan for how to respond to concerns that the interviewers might have. They might wonder if you will be able to do well in their program. They might wonder if you know the subject area that you will teach well enough. Know how you will respond to these questions ahead of time.  T: When most people think of interviews, they think of being asked questions.  It is a good idea to ask questions during interviews. It shows your interest and engagement.   T: Let’s consider some examples and non-examples of good questions. Two good questions to ask might be:  What’s the most important characteristics you are looking for when hiring for this position? What kind of training and learning opportunities will I have at this job?  T: Two questions that you shouldn’t ask are: How much vacation time do I get? How soon will I get a raise?  T: You should practice for an interview. It will help you feel less nervous, and you’ll be able to work on developing answers to questions that trip you up during practice sessions.  T: Lastly, you need to know your why. You will likely get a question about your why, such as “Why do you want to teach in this school?” or “Why do you want to attend our program?” Plan out your answer ahead of time so you will be ready to do a great job with that question.  S: (Complete chart in Student Guide.)  T: Does anyone have any questions about these best practices?  S: (Ask questions, as needed.)  T: (Answer questions, as needed.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Develop Your Why T: You will now have time to develop your why. There are some guiding questions in this section of your Student Guide. You may also want to think about experiences you had in Course I and this course. You should be able to explain your why verbally in about two minutes.  T: For now, you should think about the answer to the question “Why do you want to pursue a career in education and training?” If you are interviewing for a job at a school or admission to a program, you will want your why to be more specific to that opportunity.   T: You will now have four minutes to develop your why in writing. You may begin.  T: (Set four-minute timer.)  S: (Write their why in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice 2: Role-Play in Groups T: You will now practice stating your why to two fellow students. They’ll ask you two follow-up questions related to your why. First, we will divide into groups of three.  T: (Divide students into groups of three.)  S: (Move into groups of three.)  T: Next, we need to determine the order in which you’ll be sharing. If your first name is first alphabetically, you’ll be sharing first. Can I see the hands of the students who will be sharing first?  S: (One student in each group raises hand.)  T: The second person to share will be the one whose first name comes next alphabetically. Can I see the hands of the students who will be sharing second?  S: (One student in each group raises hand.)  T: Now, can I see the hands of the students who will be sharing last?  S: (One student in each group raises hand.)  T: I will keep time. When I say begin, the first person will share their why. When they have finished, each other member of the group should ask one follow-up question from the list in your Student Guide. If should take about two minutes for one person to share their why and about one minute each to answer each follow-up question. I will give you a thirty-second warning and then say begin again when it is the next person’s turn.  T: Are there any questions before we get started?  S: (Ask questions as needed.)  T: (Answer questions as needed.)  T: Begin.  T: (Set timer for four and half minutes. When timer alerts, give a thirty second warning. At the end of four minutes, say “Begin” to indicate that the next student should share their why.)  T: (Repeat cycle two additional times.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: May I have a volunteer share one of the best practices for interviews that was surprising to you? Explain why.  S: Responses may vary.  T: You have some homework related to this topic. When you are next at your field site, ask the teacher for three tips for interviewing for jobs in the education and training field. Add them to your Student Guide in the space provided. | Student Guide |
