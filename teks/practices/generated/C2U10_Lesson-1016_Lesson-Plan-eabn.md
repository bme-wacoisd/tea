|  | In this lesson students will work together to provide peer feedback on their personal philosophy statements. Since the statement is personal, you may want to consider how to group students to ensure safety when providing and receiving feedback. Each individual student will receive feedback from two peers. You may consider creating and displaying a list of partners for the first round and a list of partners for the second round to ensure smooth transitions and a safe and effective feedback process. A peer feedback form has been included in this lesson. You should print these forms ahead of time and provide them to students to use when providing feedback. Based on time available and needs, teachers may feel it is necessary to spend more than one class period on this lesson to allow students to incorporate the peer feedback into their statements and produce a final copy to include in their professional portfolio. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  In this lesson you will receive peer feedback on your personal philosophy statement. Review your personal philosophy statement and identify a specific question or area on which you would like to receive feedback from a peer. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Providing Peer Feedback T: In today’s lesson you will get the opportunity to receive feedback from a peer to make your personal philosophy statement more powerful. (Hand out two printed peer feedback forms to each student). I have given you two feedback forms each because we will have time to do two round of peer feedback. The first thing that you need to do is write your name in the “writers name” section of the form.  S: (Write names on forms.) T: In your bellringer today, you were asked to identify an area of focus or question that you would like to receive feedback on from your peer. Please write that on the form where it says “Question/Area of Focus from Writer.”  Be sure to write your name and area of focus on both forms. S: (Write area of focus on forms.) T:   We have talked about what makes feedback effective. Can anyone remember any qualities of effective feedback? S: (Responses may vary but should include Specific and clear, aligned with the criteria for the task and not the person, timely, and identifies both areas of strength and areas of improvement).  T: Effective feedback is specific, kind, and helpful. This is important to remember. For our purposes today, we are going to break the feedback into two parts. First, you will review the piece of work against the success criteria for the task. The peer feedback form includes a table with the success criteria that we identified and reviewed in a previous lesson. Please locate the table on the peer feedback form now. S: (Locate success criteria table.)  T: In the first step, you will read the statement of your peer and determine if the piece of work meets or exceeds expectations in each area or if it needs improvement and place a check in the corresponding column. If there are specific notes to include such as “only 1 detail was included in this section” or “did not describe effective teaching”, etc. Why would these statements be important to include in the notes? S: They are specific to how the work does not meet the success criteria. T: After you evaluate the work based on the success criteria you are going to utilize a strategy called “TAG” to provide additional feedback. T stands for “Tell me something that you like.”  A stands for “Ask a question.”  G stands for “give a suggestion.”  Has anyone ever used this strategy before to give feedback? S: (Responses will vary.) T: When you are telling something that you like, be sure to include statements that are specific and clear. Why would it not be helpful to just say “I like it” in this section?  S: You are not telling what you specifically like about the work.  T: It might be more helpful to include a statement like “You did a great job in the introduction providing clear details of why you want to become a teacher. It made the piece compelling.” T: In the Ask a Question section, you want to think about what is popping into your mind as you read. What might be missing? What is unclear that you might need help understanding? For example, you might ask a question like “Could you include specific examples from your time in a classroom to connect to your strengths?” T: For give a suggestion, this is where you will want to identify the question or area of focus the writer has identified. Based on what they have asked, you should provide a suggestion on how to address their area of focus or question. Does anyone have any questions about what you are asked to do to provide effective peer feedback? S: (Ask clarifying question.) | Student Guide PowerPoint Peer Feedback Form (At bottom of lesson) |
| 30 mins | Peer Feedback Protocol T: We will do two rounds of feedback. (Display the pre-determined partner groups on board.) Please find your partner for the first round. You will exchange your personal philosophy statement and one copy of the peer feedback form with your partner. You will have 10 minutes to each read silently and complete the peer feedback from. At the conclusion of the 10 minutes, you will have five minutes with your feedback partner to clarify any details or discuss high level feedback. What questions do you have about the protocol? S: (Ask clarifying questions.) T: Please exchange your papers with your partners and begin reading and completing the feedback form. I will let you know when it is time to move to the partner discussion. You may begin. (Set 10-minute timer.) S: (Read and provide feedback.) T: 10 minutes is now up. You may share the peer feedback form with your partner and discuss any highlights and provide clarifications. (Set timer for 5 minutes.) S: (Discuss feedback with partner.) T: Now we will move into round 2 where you will be able to receive feedback from another partner. (Display round 2 partners.) Please locate your partner for round 2. In round 2 we will utilize the same protocol where you have 10 minutes for reading and feedback and 5 minutes to discuss with your partner. You may now exchange papers with your partner for round 2 and begin working. (Set 10-minute timer.) S: (Read and provide feedback to partner 2.) T: 10 minutes is now up. You may share the peer feedback form with your partner and discuss any highlights and provide clarifications. (Set timer for 5 minutes.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
