|  | Prior to this lesson, gather the following materials: 1 coin per student group (any denomination), poster paper, markers. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Describe a time when you were asked to work as a part of a group to complete a project. What are the characteristics of effective and ineffective group work? | Student Guide |
| 2 min | T: Today we are going to begin talking about collaborative learning. This bellringer helped you to think about how you have worked together with other students in the past.  T: (Create a T-chart on the board for characteristics of effective and ineffective group work. An example is below.) T: Who will share their response to the bellringer? S: (Volunteer responses.) T: (Record responses in the chart.) | Student Guide |
| 7 mins | Introduction to Collaborative Learning T: Let’s start with defining collaborative learning. (Share definition by PPT.) Please take notes on your student guide.  T: Collaborative learning is an educational approach where groups are used to enhance learning through working together. S: (Students take notes on student guide.) T: Why is Collaborative Learning a High Impact Teaching Strategy? (Use PPT to review benefits of collaborative learning.) Collaborative learning develops higher-level thinking, verbal communication, self-management, and leadership skills. Collaborative learning exposes students to different perspectives.  Working together with a group can be tough at times. Students benefit from structuring collaborative learning experiences.  There are four key practices for structuring collaborative learning. (Share key practices by PPT.) They are: Ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary to accomplish the task. Vary the size and membership of the group according to the activity’s purpose and individual learning goals. Groups are most effective when they range in size from 3-5 participants. Use structures such as group roles, norms, and explicit time keeping ensuring that students share the responsibility and ownership of outcomes. Provide opportunities for regular feedback on group processes as well as student/group self-evaluation. Be clear about expectations and instructions for the task. T: Why is it important to ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary?  S: If collaboration isn’t necessary, students may decide to work alone, or one student might end up doing all of the work.  T: Why is it important to vary the size and membership of the group according to the task?  S: If there are too many people in a group, not everyone will be able to contribute. Sometimes it is helpful to have people who have different skills in your group. T: Have you experienced collaborative group work using group roles?  S: (Answers will vary.) T: Have you experienced collaborative group work without group roles?  S: (Answers will vary.) T: What is the impact of assigning roles on collaborative group work?  S: Everyone knows what they are supposed to do.  T: What about norms and time keeping? How do they make collaborative group work more effective? S: Having norms helps students to remember how they are supposed to behave in groups and time keeping keeps students on track. T: Why is it important to provide opportunities for feedback as well as individual and group self-evaluation?  S: Feedback on the group work will help students get better at collaborating. Self-evaluation allows students to reflect on their own work and as a member of the group. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Lesson Analysis  T: Let’s look at a scenario and determine whether the scenario meets the criteria for effective collaboration. Find the scenario in your student guide and take a minute to read it to yourself. S: (Find and read scenario.) T: Now, let’s talk about the key practices. Let’s start with the first key practice: Ensure that the task is designed so that collaboration is necessary to accomplish the task. Does this task meet the success criteria?  S: No. There are four people in the group and only two tasks – flipping the coin and collecting data – for the first part of the activity and one task – creating the bar graph – for the second part of the activity. The task does not require collaboration. T: That’s right. To make this task worthy of collaboration, the teacher would need to make it impossible to complete alone. How might she have done that?  S: (Answers will vary. Ideas may include: limiting time so that students didn’t have time to flip and record, changing the task so that each student collected their own data and then they collaborated to find an average and create multiple representations of the data.) T: What about the next key practice: Vary the size and membership of the group according to the activity’s purpose and individual learning goals. Groups are most effective when they range in size from 3-5 participants. S: The groups were less than 5 participants but since the task didn’t need this many people, it doesn’t fit the key practices. Also, it doesn’t look like the teacher thought about who was in each group because she let them choose their groups. T: How many people might have been appropriate for this task?  S: Maybe two. One to flip the coin and one to record the information if the teacher put a time limit on the activity.  T: Did the teacher use structures such as group roles, norms, and explicit time keeping ensuring that students share the responsibility and ownership of outcomes. S: She did say to identify a coin flipper so there was one role, but other students didn’t have roles. Also, the scenario didn’t include norms or explicit times. T: How could she better meet this key practice?  S: She could have moved students to partners and assigned one the role of coin flipper and one the role of data collector. She could have provided norms for partner work like focus on your role and listen to your partner. She could have set a timer or asked students to set a timer – one minute for the data collection and two minutes to create the chart, for example. T: Did the teacher provide opportunities for regular feedback on group processes as well as student/group self-evaluation. S: No, the scenario did not address feedback or self-evaluation.  T: Why do you think feedback and self-evaluation are important for collaborative group work?  S: Feedback and self-evaluation can help students get better at working in groups.  T: How might the teacher provide feedback to students about their group work?  S: She might circulate while students are working and provide specific feedback to partners or provide trends she noticed to the whole class after the collaboration.  T: What about the last key practice: Be clear about expectations and instructions for the task? Was the teacher clear about expectations and instructions?  S: No. The instructions were missing some of the steps and did not go in order.  T: Yes, they could have been clearer. Take three minutes to revise the directions. Write your own directions in your student guide using the double plan organizer. (Set timer for 3 minutes.) T: Who will share their revised instructions? (Call on one student to share their revised directions. | Student Guide 1 Coin per Group Printer Paper Markers |
| 15 mins | Practice 2: Planning for Collaborative Group Work T: Now, it’s your turn to plan for collaborative group work. I am going to give you two scenarios. You will work with a partner to plan for each of the scenarios.  T: As you work with your partner, we are going to use a strategy called rally coach. In rally coach, one partner will be the planner and will talk out loud about their planning process and decisions. The other partner will be the coach. The coach will support the planner by asking and answering questions and providing reminders when necessary. You will switch roles after the first scenario so you each have an opportunity to be the planner and the rally coach.  T: Find the two scenarios and the planning guide in your student guide. Take a moment to read each scenario.  S: (Read scenarios.) I will assign you partners. After I have read all the assignments, move to find a location with your partner and determine who will be the planner for each scenario. (Read pair assignments.) S: (Find their partners and decide who will be the planner for each scenario.) T: You will each have 6 minutes to talk through the planning guide for your scenario. Remember that the rally coach is there for support only if the planner gets stuck. I will set a timer for 6 minutes. You may choose who goes first. Your 6 minutes starts now. S: (The first planner uses the planning guide to plan implementation of their collaborative group work. Rally coach provides support, as necessary.) T: Your 6 minutes is up. Time to switch roles.  S: (Switch roles. Second planner talks through plan out loud. Rally coach supports, as necessary.) |  |
| 5 mins | Student Practice Debrief - Whole Group T: What were some of the key decisions you made as you planned?  S: Answers will vary. T: Why is it important to be intentional about planning for group work?  S: Because if group work isn’t planned for, one student may end up doing all of the work. Groups may become disorganized and not be able to get anything done. Students may spend the time socializing instead of learning. |  |
