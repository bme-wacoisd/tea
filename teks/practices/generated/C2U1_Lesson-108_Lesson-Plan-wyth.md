| Rationale/ Summary | This is the second of two lessons that address the concept of designing effective routines. This lesson provides students the opportunity to work with a group to create their own routine using the systems planning template.  Effective systems and routines are essential for creating a foundation for instruction and learning. Learning how to design effective systems and routines will set students up for creating safe and effective classrooms. | This is the second of two lessons that address the concept of designing effective routines.

What challenges might you face in establishing a new routine with student?  See 1.08 – Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar response. | What changes would you consider making to your routine?

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Why are well-planned systems and routines important in the classroom?  What are three characteristics of systems and routines that engineer efficiency? | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Creating a Multi-Step Routine  T: Yesterday we discussed double planning as an effective way to establish routines. Why is it helpful for a teacher to double plan routines?  S: Because double planning establishes what the students and teacher should be doing when the routine takes place.  T: Today we are going to practice creating multi-step routines through double planning. Before you try this on your own, let’s do an example together.  T: Let’s double plan the end of class routine we use in this class.   T: (Display the double planning template provided in the PowerPoint.)  T: Who can summarize our end of class routine, starting with our Exit Ticket until you exit the classroom?  S: Answers will vary depending on classroom routine.  T: Great. Now let’s break that routine down. I will record our end of class routine in this table.   S: Answers will vary depending on classroom routine.  T: (Break down the class routine with the students using the double planning template provided in the PowerPoint.) | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Group Assignments & Systems Planning (Individual)  T: Great job. Now you’re going to have the opportunity to create your own classroom routines.   T: This will be a group activity. You will be in one of five groups. Starting with one, we’re going to count off to see which group you’ll be in. (Count off students to assign them in groups and indicate where groups will be located).  T: Please move to your assigned group.  S: (Move to groups.)  T: Each group is going to be responsible for creating a routine for a certain part of a class period. Here is your scenario: You are a fourth-grade math teacher. You want to establish routines with your students around beginning class, group work, passing out and collecting materials, finishing a test, and the end of class.   T: These are the routines that each group is responsible for creating.  Group 1: Beginning of class routine  Group 2: Group work routine Group 3: Passing Out/Collecting Materials  Group 4: Finishing a test  Group 5: End of Class Routine   T: (Display routine assignments on PowerPoint slide.)  T: Does every group know which routine they will be creating?  S: (Acknowledge or ask questions.)  T:  In your student guide find the Systems Planning Independent template.   S: (Locate Systems Planning Independent template in Student Guide.)   T: Using this template, you will independently brainstorm how you envision the routine your group is assigned. You’ll have five minutes to write the routine on your own. Once five minutes have passed, you’ll come together as a group to compare your answers and decide on one agreed upon routine.  T: (Set a timer for five minutes and monitor students while they work.)  S: (Work independently.) |  |
| 10 mins | Systems Planning (Group Final)  T: Next, you’re going to work with you group mates. Each group member will share their plan. Once all plans have been shared, discuss which parts of each plan you think are most effective at establishing the routine for your fourth-grade class.   T: In your student guide find the Systems Planning Group Final template.   S: (Locate Systems Planning Group Final template in Student Guide.)   T: Once your group has made a final decision, all group members need to record your routine in this guide.   T: You’ll have ten minutes to complete this part of the activity.  T: What questions do you have?  S: (Ask questions, if any.)  T: (Set a timer for 10 minutes and monitor students while they work) |  |
| 7 mins | Peer-to-Peer Feedback:   T: Let’s take an opportunity to get feedback from your classmates about the routine your group created. First, move back to your original seats.   S: (transition back to seats)  T: Make sure your Student Guide is open to the Systems Planning Group Final template. Exchange your Student Guide with someone who is seated near you who was not in your group.   S: (Exchange Student Guide.)  T: Does everyone have someone else’s Student Guide?  T: You should have your classmate’s Student Guide open to the Systems Planning Group Final template. On the next page there is a blank rubric. You will fill out the rubric in their Student Guide. Write your name in the space that says, “Reviewed By.”  S: (Writes name on rubric.)  T: Next, read over your classmate’s plan and fill out the rubric based on the three criteria for creating an effective routine. If you feel the routine meets the criteria, provide evidence as to why. If you feel the routine does not yet meet the criteria, provide feedback as to how it might be improved. You have 5 minutes to complete the review.   S: (Review Systems Planning document and provide feedback on rubric.)  T: Return the Student Guides back to the original owner. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: What did you find challenging about this activity?   S: Answers will vary.  T: Why is it important for teachers to establish routines in their classrooms?  S: Because routines create a safe learning environment where students know what is expected of them.   T: How does double planning help with routine establishment?  S: Double planning lets the teacher see what both they and the students are doing during the routine, which provides clear expectations of what the students are doing and holds the teacher accountable for what they will be doing during the routine as well. |  |
| 5 mins | Exit Ticket S: (Complete the exit ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
