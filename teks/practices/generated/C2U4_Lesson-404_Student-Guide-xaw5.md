Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Imagine you’re a new sixth-grade teacher and you are planning a lesson with the following learning goal:

Students will compare/contrast authors’ choices when writing an informative essay vs. a persuasive essay.

Students are familiar with the definitions and characteristics of persuasive writing and informative writing. Now, you’ll need to give students a task to practice their understanding. You go online, enter the relevant content standard into the search box of a popular lesson-sharing website and examine your options. You find two alternatives:

If you want students to understand the ways an author’s purpose influences their writing, which activity do you choose – and why?




#### Think-Pair-Share: Attending to the Most Important Content

What do you remember from yesterday’s lesson? Take a minute to record your thoughts below.



#### Practice 1: Identifying the Most Important Content

To determine the most important content, ask yourself two questions:
- What do students need to know, be able to do, and understand about the content?
- Where do I want to focus my students’ attention?

Read the scenarios below from a 2nd grade classroom and complete the graphic organizer.

| Activity 1: Go on a newspaper scavenger hunt. Search for 2 examples of informative writing and 2 examples of persuasive writing and complete the activities below.    Read each article. Then, write a two-sentence summary of each article that includes the author’s purpose. Begin each summary with one of the following paragraph starters: In this article, the author informs the reader about. . .  In this article, the author persuades the reader about. . .   Respond to the following questions.   What kind of writing was easier to find? Why might this be? What kind of writing did you enjoy more? Explain your reasoning. |

| Activity 2: Read the two articles provided about the same topic (a short news articles and a short opinion piece). Complete the Venn diagram to compare/contrast the articles. Pay special attention to the characteristics of each type of essay as you compete the Venn diagram. Then, respond to the questions below:  How can the differences between the two articles be attributed to author’s purpose?  What would the author of the opinion piece need to change if their purpose were to inform?  What would the author of the news piece need to change if their purpose were to persuade? |

| Today you and your class are going to be reading Cinderella. The goal of the lesson is for students to identify story elements as they read and to use those story elements to answer questions about the story (for example: What was the setting of the story? Who were the main characters?). |  |  |
| Today you and your class are going to be looking at and sorting photographs from the environment below Mount Everest. The goal of the lesson is for students to describe patterns in the kinds of plants and animals that live below Mount Everest. |  |  |
| Today you and your class are going to use various measuring tools to measure objects. The goal of the lesson is for students to find the length of objects using concrete models and determine the length of objects to the nearest marked unit. |  |  |


| Lesson Activity | Aligned to Most Important Content? (Yes/No) | If no, how might the teacher improve the alignment? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bellringer: Have you ever heard about Cinderella? What do you know about her? If not, what is your favorite story? |  |  |
| Intro to Story Elements: Teacher will define and provide examples and nonexamples of story elements. The teacher will ask students to share additional examples. |  |  |
| Think-Aloud: The teacher will begin reading the story aloud. As the teacher encounters story elements, they will pause the reading and think-aloud, identifying and explaining the element. |  |  |
| Guided Practice: The teacher will continue reading aloud and will pause at key moments to ask students what they predict will happen next. |  |  |
| Independent Practice: Students will choose a scene from Cinderella and will rewrite the scene changing story elements. |  |  |
| Exit Ticket: Students will watch a quick video that illustrates a complete story. They will complete a Story Map about the video on which they record elements of the story that were taught today. |  |  |
