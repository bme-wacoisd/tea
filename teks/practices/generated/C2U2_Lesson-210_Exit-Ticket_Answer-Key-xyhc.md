### Lesson 2.10: Classroom Rules

Name:
Date:

Consider the set of rules below for a 2nd grade classroom. Is this an effective set of classroom rules based on the success criteria? Provide and explain 3 reasons from the success criteria to justify your response. Use specific examples from the rules in your justification.





This is not an effective set of classroom rules based on the success criteria.

- Limit to between 3–5 in number
- This set includes 14 rules.
- Rules should be understandable
- Students in a second-grade classroom may not understand some of the language in these rules including “disciplinary action,” “surf the Internet,” and “privilege, not a right.”
- Rules should be easy to monitor (observable)
- Rules like “Computer lab is a privilege, not a right” is not observable. What will the teacher be looking for to hold students accountable? Additionally, they can be hard to monitor. “Students will not be allowed to surf the Internet” is hard to monitor if the teacher can’t see every student screen at the same time.
- Rules should be stated positively when it makes sense to do so
- Rules like “Three tardies will result in disciplinary action” should be reworded to state positively. For example, replace with “Please be in your seat when the bell rings.”
- Rules should address the most important expectations for students
- Rules that fall under heading of assignments, for example, are not the most important expectations for students. Heading of assignments should be a part of procedures, not rules.




| Tardies: The child should be in their seat when the bell rings. The door to the classroom will be shut after the bell rings. Three tardies will result in disciplinary actions being taken – loss of participation points or d-hall. Hall Passes: Three hall passes will be given to each student for the year. Hall passes can be used to go to the restroom or to your locker. Late Assignments: All assignments must be turned in on the appointed day of class. Late assignments will lose twenty points each day they are late. Any assignment three or more days late will be counted as a zero. Computer Lab / Internet: Students will not be allowed to surf the Internet. Computer lab is a privilege, not a right. Food and Drinks: All food and drink should be in your backpack at all times. Disciplinary actions will be taken if you are caught with food or drinks. Heading of Assignments: Name, date and period should be included in the top right-hand corner of your assignment. Please do not turn in paper ripped out of spiral notebooks. |
