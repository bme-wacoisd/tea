| Rationale/ Summary | This is the first in a series of lessons that addresses the concept of effective directions. This lesson introduces the concept and specific criteria. Lessons 1.05 – 1.06 provide opportunity for application and practice. To implement strong routines, teachers need to know how to give specific, sequential, and observable directions. Additionally, this skill helps teachers move beyond routines to provide effective directions for students during non-routine moments in the classroom. | This is the first in a series of lessons that addresses the concept of effective directions.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think about the routines that we use in class, including what to do when you enter the classroom, Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up, and Turn and Talk. What do these routines have in common? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Demonstration and Reflection: The Need for Clear and Specific Directions T: Get into groups and discuss your responses to the bellringer.  S: (Try to form groups and experience challenges.)  T: Let’s return to our seats. What just happened?  S: We were confused.  T: Why were you confused?  S: We didn’t know exactly what you wanted.  T: What are some of the things you needed to know from me?  S: Student responses may vary but may include: How many people are in a group? Can we get up from our seats to form groups? How should we get into groups?  T: Those are all great questions. I did not give you effective directions. Today, we’re going to dig into the need for teachers to give effective directions, as well as what makes directions effective. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Three Key Characteristics of Effective Directions T: There are three characteristics of effective directions. They must be specific. Directions that are specific describe concrete actions that students should take.  S: (Add to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: Effective directions are sequential. They provide the order in which students need to complete the actions.  S: (Add to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: Effective directions need to be observable. The teacher needs to be able to see the students following the directions.  S: (Add to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: In addition to whether instructions are effective, we need to consider when a teacher provides them. The best place to provide instructions is during a transition in class. A transition is the space and time between instructional activities during which teacher and students make a shift from one activity to another.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: During transitions, teachers should provide effective directions for the next part of class, unless students will be using a routine that they already know. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Example and Non-Example of Effective Directions T: In your Student Guide, there is a set of directions that a teacher would give before students begin working on an assignment. Read the directions silently to yourselves; then, circle the correct answer to the questions that follow.  S: (Read Directions #1 in Student Guide and circle appropriate responses.)  T: Do these directions demonstrate any of the characteristics of effective directions? If so, which ones?  S: They are sequential, but that is the only one.  T: They’re not specific, and parts of them are not observable. Let’s look at the second set of directions. Read the directions silently to yourselves; then, circle the correct answer to the questions that follow.  S: (Read Directions #2 in Student Guide and circle appropriate responses.)  T: Is this revised set of questions specific, sequential, and observable?  S: Yes  T: What changes made these directions more specific than the original directions?  S: Student responses may vary but may include: The students now know when and how to get into groups. They know how they are supposed to take turns sharing their thoughts and getting feedback from their peers. They know how much they must write for their assignment.  T: We already discussed how the original directions were sequential. But, we said that they were not observable. How are these revised directions more observable than the first set?  S: Student responses may vary but may include: The teacher can see when students are done with their own thinking and ready to get into groups. The teacher can see when groups have formed and are working on the feedback process. The teacher can see the students engaging in the process because they write notes. The teacher can see when students have finished getting feedback and are writing their letter to the editor. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Video on Effective Directions T: We’re going to watch a video of a teacher giving instructions to her class. As you watch, answer the first question for each of the characteristics of effective directions. You’ll be identifying examples of specific, sequential, and observable directions in the video. Leave the second question for each characteristic blank for now.  T: (Play video.)  T: I’m going to ask you to turn and talk with a partner. Discuss the examples you identified. Compare the examples you identified and select the best example. Make sure you have that example written in your Student Guide. Then, work with your partner to answer the second question. You will have five minutes to work with your partner. Turn and talk!  T: Now we’re going to review the answers. Who would like to volunteer to share an example of how the teacher’s instructions were specific and how they show this characteristic?  S: She told them to circle their answers to the subtraction problem. It’s specific because students know how they should mark their answer when they have solved the problem. That is more specific than just telling them to write their answer on the page.  T: Who would like to volunteer to share an example of how the teacher’s instructions were sequential and how they show this characteristic?  S: She asked the students to count the circles first. Then, she told them to write the number that was one less. It’s sequential because the students knew the order of steps to solve the subtraction problem. First, they had to count the number of circles, then they had to take one away.  T: Who would like to volunteer to share an example of how the teacher’s instructions were observable and how they show this characteristic?  S: She told the students to put their fingers on box 1. It’s observable because she can see if the students are putting their fingers in the right place. | Planning & Delivering Instructions-Jennifer Crucetti |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: What are the three characteristics of effective directions?  S: They need to be specific, sequential, and observable.  T: When should teachers give effective directions to students?  S: When the class is transitioning from one activity to another |  |
