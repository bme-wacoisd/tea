How do least invasive interventions help create a strong classroom culture?
Using least invasive interventions creates a safe classroom space where students feel they can take risks. Students are held accountable for upholding high expectations which communicates to them that you believe in their ability to achieve success. Least invasive interventions make student redirection and intervention nearly invisible so that teaching and learning is not disrupted.   A teacher can also easily maintain anonymity when using least invasive interventions, which promotes a safe environment.




| Keys for effective interventions | Scenario |
| --- | --- |
| Reinforce previously taught expectations | A student in Mr. E’s class is tapping another student on the arm. Mr. E models how to fold his hands in front of him. |
| Redirect Early | Mrs. P walks around the room and redirects behavior nonverbally as she leads a class discussion. |
| Deliver Nonverbals While Teaching | Mrs. K redirects a student who is off task with a calm voice and a warm smile. |
| Communicate the Solution | Mr. J uses a nonverbal cue immediately after noticing a side-conversation. |
| Model Emotional Constancy | Mrs. M consistently reviews her expectations for lining up for recess. |
