### Lesson 7.06: Worked Examples

Name:
Date:
- What is a worked example?  How is it the same or different from the strategy of modeling?
Worked examples are a step-by-step demonstration of how to complete a task or solve a problem.
It is similar to modeling because the teacher is demonstrating a process step by step.  Both worked examples and modeling help students to see what they need to do and how to be successful in doing it.
It is different because worked examples focus the process for solving a problem,  include the step and  the rationale for the step.
- Look at the scenario provided below for a worked example.  Does this worked example meet the criteria to be effective?  Provide evidence for your decision based on the chart of criteria below.
Scenario:
An English teacher asks her class to write a short essay that recounted the three most important events that happened during the weekend.  She modeled the process with a worked example of the steps shown below sharing how each step contributes to the process:
- Write a list of all the activities you did during the weekend.
- Rank the activities from most important to least important.
- Identify two fun facts about each of the top three activities.
- Use these fun facts to craft short sentences about the activities that can be combined to create the essay.
The teacher began by modeling the process by sharing her planning notes and sample essay, which the class reviewed together.  She annotated the steps on her notes and essay as she reviewed it with the class.  The class was then asked to follow the steps to craft their sentences for their essay.  Prior to writing the full essay, the students shared their work with a partner to get feedback.  They then wrote the brief essay.


| Criteria | Does it meet the criteria to be effective? (Yes/No) | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focus on Process | Yes | The teacher clearly outlined a process for the task and modeled the process for the students. |
| Provides steps & rationale | Yes | Based on the description, there was no mention of rationale for steps, however, clear steps were articulated for the task. |
| Increasing complexity | Yes | The teacher first modeled the process, then asked them to start by writing the sentences.  They shared sentences with their peers before crafting the essay. |
