| Rationale/ Summary | This is the third in a series of lessons that addresses the concept of effective directions. This lesson provides an opportunity for students to learn how to deliver instructions effectively and practice this skill. To implement strong routines, teachers need to know how to give specific, sequential, and observable directions. Additionally, this skill helps teachers move beyond routines to provide effective directions for students during non-routine moments in the classroom. | This is the third in a series of lessons that addresses the concept of effective directions.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Describe the criteria for delivering directions effectively. After seeing your partner giving directions and delivering your own instructions, what do you think are your strengths when it comes to delivering directions?  Where are your areas for growth?

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think of an effective teacher you have experienced. Think beyond the content of the directions they provided to consider the way they delivered the directions. Describe how the teacher looked and sounded when delivering instructions. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Effective Delivery of Instructions T: For the last several classes, we have focused on how teachers need to provide specific, sequential, and observable directions. We have yet discussed how a teacher needs to deliver those instructions to students.  T: Can I have a volunteer share their response to the bellringer?  S: Answers may vary but may include: They spoke in a clear voice. They looked at the students while speaking. They spoke slowly.  T: These are excellent examples. There are specific words that are used to describe how someone’s voice sounds when they speak.  T: Pace is the speed at which someone speaks.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Cadence is the rhythm of someone’s speech.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Pitch is the highness or lowness of someone’s voice.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Volume is the loudness or quietness of someone’s voice.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Tone is the accent or inflection of speech that indicates mood or emotion.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Teachers need to consider pace, cadence, pitch, volume, and tone when they speak to students, especially when they give directions. Teachers should use a slower pace, an even cadence, a lower pitch, a quieter volume, and a serious tone.  S: (Add adjectives to Student Guide.)  T: Teachers also need to consider their body language when they give directions. They should stand still to convey the importance of the directions.  S: (Fill in the blanks in Student Guide.)  T: I will now model how to give directions effectively using our school procedure for a fire drill.  T (While standing still, provide your school’s directions for a fire drill. Be sure to use a slower pace, an even cadence, a lower pitch, a quieter volume, and a serious tone.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Video Reflection T: I’m going to show you a video of a teacher providing instructions to their class. As you watch, take notes on the teacher’s pace, cadence, pitch, volume, and tone in your Student Guide.  T: (Play video. Stop the video at the 15-second mark.)  S: (Take notes in Student Guide.)  T: Since the video is short, I am going to play it one more time. Add to the notes you made in your Student Guide.  T: (Replay video and stop at the 15-second mark.)  S: (Add to notes in Student Guide.)  T: Let’s debrief what we saw. How would you describe the teacher’s pace?  S: She speaks slowly.  T: How about her cadence?  S: She speaks clearly and evenly.  T: And her pitch?  S: Her voice is low.  T: What is her volume?  S: She speaks quietly.  T: How about her tone?  S: She sounds serious.  T: What was her body language while giving directions?  S: She stands still. | Student Guide Video: Planning and Delivering Instructions – Ijeoma Duru |
| 15 mins | Practice 2: Feedback on Partner-Delivered Directions T: You’ll now have the opportunity to practice giving directions effectively and receive feedback from one of your classmates.  T: In your Student Guide, you’ll see a rubric for delivering instructions effectively. It includes the information we have discussed today. Take a minute to review the rubric silently.  S: (Review rubric in Student Guide silently.)  T: When we begin this activity, I will ask you to Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up. Find a partner. When you have found a partner and are seated again, exchange Student Guides. Select a partner to give directions first. This student will give the directions for how we return to whole-group discussion after we have been working independently. While this student gives direction, their partner should complete the rubric in the Student Guide. When the first partner is done giving directions, you should switch roles. The student who completed the rubric first should now give directions while the other student completes the rubric.  T: We’ll have five minutes for this part of the activity. Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up!  S: (Form pairs, exchange Student Guides, and alternate between giving directions and completing the rubric.)  T: We’re now ready for the second piece of the activity. You’ll exchange Student Guides and review the feedback from your partner. Ask your partner any questions you have about their feedback. The person who gave directions first should ask questions first.   T: You have five minutes for this section. Begin!  S: (Exchange Student Guides, review feedback, and ask questions about feedback.)  T: Now, you’re going to exchange Student Guides again. Using the feedback you received from your partner, deliver the instructions for how we return to whole-group discussion after we have been working independently again. Your partner will complete the rubric again. You’ll then switch roles.  T: You have five minutes. Begin!  S: (Exchange Student Guides and alternate between giving directions and completing the rubric.)  T: Please give the Student Guide back to your partner and return to your seats.  S: (Complete final Student Guide exchange and return to seats). | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: How many people got better feedback from their partners when they gave directions for a second time?  S: (Raise hands.)  T: How did you improve?  S: Answers may vary but may include: I had to stand still instead of moving around. I talked too quickly the first time. I wasn’t loud enough. I was laughing and didn’t sound serious.  T: It sounds like you were able to make improvements based on the feedback you received from your partners. |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
