Name:
Date:
Question 1:
Students in Ms. West’s 3rd grade class are wrapping up an art activity before lunch. Students have markers and scissors scattered on their workspaces. Ms. West is going to visit each workspace to collect the materials. She would like students to have these materials ready for her to collect. She would also like individual students to be responsible for cleaning up their workspaces by throwing away scraps of paper on their way to lining up at the door.
What directions should Ms. West give her students?







Question 2:
Student in Ms. East’s Biology class have been working independently to finish up lab reports. As the end of the class approaches, she asks them to turn in the reports before they leave, mark any areas of the report where they still have questions with a question mark, and think about the part of the report that is most well-written.
Her students are confused about what they are supposed to do. Circle one characteristic of effective directions and describe how the directions could be modified to better reflect that characteristic.
