Students will analyze various lesson plans to identify and explain how each of the tasks cognitively engages students and requires effortful thinking. | In this lesson, students will learn about how a teacher can engage students in rigorous tasks to cognitively engage students.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will examine a nonexample lesson plan and analyze the tasks using the questions below: What are students physically doing during the task? How is the task helping students think deeply about the content? How can you modify the task to ensure students are cognitively engaged? | Students will examine a nonexample lesson plan and analyze the tasks using the questions below: What are students physically doing during the task?

| 5 mins | Bellringer Read the short passage and examine the five questions that correspond to the passage. For each question, identify if the question is or is not cognitively engaging and defend your answers with evidence.  T: Remember that using a variety of questioning types, such as surface-level and deeper questions are important for learning. S: (Complete bell ringer in student guide) T: Stand up, hands up, pair up. Find someone you don’t know well to partner with. With your partner, compare your answers and reasons for each question.  S: (Find a partner. Compare answers and reasons for each question.)  T: Return to your seats. Now that you have shared with a partner, who will share with the whole class? S: (Volunteer responses.) | Text Source: https://www.k12reader.com/worksheet/competing-for-resources/view/ |
| 5 mins | Intro to Rigorous Tasks  T: Today, we are going to talk about an important way instruction can cognitively engage students – through the assignment of rigorous tasks.  T: What do you think of when you think of the word task?  S: Work that you do, raking leaves, etc.  T: For teachers, tasks are things that a student must do in class to learn.  T: What do you think of when you think of the word rigorous?  S: Hard, challenging.  T: Yes. Rigorous means the task requires students to engage in effortful thinking to deepen their understanding of the content. A rigorous task requires students to cognitively engage with the most important content. In an earlier lesson, we learned that cognitive engagement asks students to think about the why and how of something. T: In the future, we will explore lessons plans in depth. Among other features, lesson plans contain a sequence of tasks that are intended to lead to learning. Tasks are things a student must do. They can include: Reading Writing Discussing Note-taking. Collaborating Practicing worked examples  T: What are some other tasks you engage in during instruction?   S: (Share additional examples.)  T: While listening is of course a key part of learning, when lessons require only listening without the expectation of any other action by a student, a teacher runs the risk of losing student attention. What happens when students are no longer attending to information?   S: They don’t learn.  T: Why is passive listening the least likely to cognitively engage students?  S: It doesn’t require students to do anything. When students have tasks to do, there are more ways to ensure their brains are active. |  |
| 5 mins | Guidelines for Rigorous Tasks  T: It is important to note that not all tasks are created equal. (Share guidelines for rigorous tasks from Deans for Impact via PPT.)   Rigorous tasks  Build on and extend prior knowledge. Involve effortful thought. Deepen conceptual understanding of material. Require learners to communicate their understanding to others. Involve multiple interpretations or paths to a solution.  T: Why might the use of rigorous tasks be a better approach than a lecture to cognitively engage students?  S: Rigorous tasks require students to think more deeply about something by asking why or how something happens. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice 1:   T: Let’s look at the launch activity for Lesson 18 of the 3rd grade Earth Changes science unit. (Display the lesson plan.) Take a minute to read the first part of the launch.) S: (Read excerpt from the lesson plan.) T: (Engage in a think-aloud.) T: When I read this lesson plan, I want to think about two important questions: What are students physically doing during the task? How does this task align to the guidelines for rigorous tasks to help students think deeply about the content? T: I’m going to use a graphic organizer to record my thinking. (Model how to record information in the following graphic organizer.) T: Students must think about how a sharpened pencil has changed over time. Students compare their ideas with a partner. Students examine an unsharpened pencil and record additional changes they observe in the sharpened pencil now that they have compared the two pencils. Students consider how other objects, such as the pencil, can change.  T: In just the first few minutes of this lesson, the teacher builds on and extends prior knowledge and involves effortful thought by having students think critically about how an object has changed, how we know an object has changed, and make comparisons between two objects. The teacher asked open-ended questions that provided space for multiple interpretations. The teacher also required learners to communicate their understanding to others by comparing ideas with a partner.  T: Now, it is your turn. Read the rest of the launch and use the graphic organizer to record what students are physically doing during the task, and how the task aligns to the guidelines for rigorous tasks to help students think deeply about the content. What are students physically doing during the task? How does this task align to the guidelines for rigorous tasks to help students think deeply about the content? S: (Students will complete the graphic organizer in their student guide.) | Earth Changes Lesson 18 launch activity – Teacher Guide Page 190 |
| 10 mins | Practice 2 T: You will now work in groups to analyze the remainder of Lesson 18 to determine the tasks the teacher uses to engage students. Use the questions and guidelines for rigorous tasks to guide your thinking and record evidence on the graphic organizer in the student guide.   S: (Students will analyze the remainder of lesson 18 and record evidence of rigorous and authentic tasks that foster cognitive engagement) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: How did the tasks in Lesson 18 cognitively engage students?   S: The lesson provided multiple opportunities for students to critically examine photographs of Earth events, examine the characteristics, and categorize the images with peers. This allowed students to build on and extend prior knowledge, involved effortful thought, required learners to communicate their understanding to others, and allowed for multiple interpretations. The teacher asked higher-order thinking questions that allowed students the opportunity to think critically about how and why something was happening. Students also had to order Earth events by how long they took to happen, which forced students to think about their own prior knowledge and involved effortful thought. |  |
