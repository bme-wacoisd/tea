## Exit Ticket - Answer Key

### Lesson 3.09: Engaging Families to Improve Student Outcomes

Name:
Date:
Use the following scenario to complete questions 1 and 2.
Jasmine is a great student who is doing well in class but has not turned in three homework assignments in the last two weeks. You have called home before but have had trouble getting someone on the phone.
- What other methods of communication can you use to contact Jasmine’s family?
Jasmine’s family has not answered the phone when we called previously, so we should use another method of communication. Instead, I would either go on a home visit or send her parents an email.

- Use your suggested communication method to complete the Family Communication Tracking Log below as if you were able to communicate with Jasmine’s family. Feel free to get creative with your notes and next steps!



| Student Name | Outreach Date | Contact Method | Reason for contact | Call notes | Next Steps/Follow up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jasmine | 10/5 | Answers may vary (cannot include phone call) | Jasmine has not turned in her last three homework assignments. | Communicated with Jasmine’s dad, and he asked if she could make up the assignments. | Dad will make sure Jasmine completes the missing assignments. Ms. Williamson will allow her to submit the missing assignments. She will also reach out if Jasmine misses another assignment. |
