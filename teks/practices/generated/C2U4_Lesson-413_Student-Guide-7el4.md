Instructional Activity 2:  Non-Example of Deliberate Practice


Student Practice: 2nd Grade ELA Scenario: Lesson 4 Adjectives
(Adapted from Amplify Texas Grade 2 Skills 5)
Lesson goal:  Students will recognize the suffix -ous indicates a word is an adjective and will pair adjectives with nouns.
Lesson:
- As a whole group, the class will read from a story called “The Beginning” from Sir Gus.
- As they read, students will play a game called “Adjective Hunt” where they will find as many adjectives as they can in the story.  The teacher will record the words on the board as they are identified by the class.
- The teacher will introduce a type of adjective that ends in -ous, providing the example of “famous.”
- Students will sound out the word and then use the root to determine the meaning.
- Students will create a list individually of all the words they know that end in -ous.  The teacher will ask for examples and record them on the board.
- After creating the list, the students will think of nouns that they could pair with the adjectives.  This will be done individually.
- Students will then share the pairings they created with a partner.
- For homework, students are given another passage to read and identify any -ous adjectives and their respective nouns.
- At the end of class, the teacher mentions they will review this idea again at the beginning of class the next day.

|  |  |  | Students were asked to read through essays and identify the thesis statements.  They are not practicing the skill of writing the thesis statements which makes the practice authentic. |
|  |  | If you are introduced to new vocabulary words in Spanish class.  You are initially introduced to the words, then you practice using the words in speaking and writing each day throughout the entire unit. |  |
|  |  |  | A non-example of low stakes would be standing up in front of a large group of people you don’t know to practice the speech. This is high stakes because you might feel self -conscious or uncomfortable practicing in front of you don’t know or feel like they are judging you. |
|  |  | A teacher circulates around the room during independent practice and identifies one strength and one areas of growth for each student. |  |
