### Lesson 6.07: Scaffolding a Lesson | Intro to Gradual Release

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Compare each parent’s approach to teaching their child how to ride a bike.
- Parent #1: When teaching her son to ride a bike, the parent sat on the bike to demonstrate how to ride. She provided her son with training wheels to start then gradually raised the training wheels. Once she felt her son was ready, the mom took off the training wheels and instead used her hand to guide her son as she walked beside him. Once the boy felt steady, the mom removed her guiding hand and let her son take off on his own.

- Parent #2: When teaching his son to ride a bike, the parent explained how to ride the bike. He explained to his son how to sit on the seat, steady himself, and use the peddles. Then, he put his son on the bike and gave him a push.

Which approach likely led to more success and why?
