Directions: Apply the principles of the Assume the Best and Allow Plausible Anonymity techniques to draft a redirection statement for the scenario below from Texas TLAC Online.

Scenario: You signal that you’d like students to stop their independent work and turn their attention to a peer, but two students are still working on their assignments. Practice crafting a statement that Assumes the Best and Allows Plausible Anonymity at the same time.

As you plan, ensure your statement:

- Attributes behavior to positive intent
- Tells students exactly what they should do
- Doesn’t name individual students
- Uses Economy of Language


Draft Statement:
Answers will vary. Exemplar response example- "Pause. I wasn’t clear. Pencils down and eyes on (Student's Name). Need two sets of eyes and we’re perfect. Thank you."
