- Describe why directing students’ attention is vital to helping students learn. Use components of the simple memory model to explain why. Exemplar Response:  Because there is only so much a person can pay attention to in their environment it is very important that a teacher think about directing students’ attention to what they really want them to know so that their working memory can be engaged in thinking about the things we want them to learn – not other unimportant ideas or activities.

- Choose which activity best focuses student’s attention on the most important content. Why did you choose this activity? Activity B.  While activity A is an interesting and potentially engaging activity, it would be more aligned to a learning goal like, “Compose a poem using descriptive language.”  Because the lesson is about this poem’s meaning and citing evidence, Activity B focuses student’s attention on that task effectively.





| Learning Goal  Students will determine the implicit and explicit meaning in a poem, citing textual evidence. | Activity A  Students will read the poem independently. They will then turn and talk with their partner focusing on the question: “What stood out most to you when you read the poem?”  After discussing what stood out most, students will spend some time writing a poem that reflects an important experience in their past. Then students will read their poem aloud to the class. |

They will then turn and talk with their partner focusing on the question: “Where in the poem (what lines, words, or clauses) do you notice that help you understand the meaning of the poem?  Underline those features.”  Synopsize the explicit meaning of the poem and the implicit meaning of the poem using the parts of the text you underlined. |
