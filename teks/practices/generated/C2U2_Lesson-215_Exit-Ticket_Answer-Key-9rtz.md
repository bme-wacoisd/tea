|  | Still Working on It. Provide Suggestions for Improvement. | You got it! Provide Evidence. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specific: The directions are clearly defined or identified. | Responses will vary but should demonstrate how the teacher will provide clear and specific instructions for the assignment. The teacher did not provide clear instructions. She vaguely explained what students needed to do once they began working on the assignment. Students also did not know exactly how to get into groups, as she left it very open. She told students to look at each of the sentences and see what you think about them. |  |
| Concrete: The directions provide specific instructions or actions. | Responses will vary but should demonstrate how the teacher will provide concrete instructions and actions for the assignment. The teacher did not define specific actions for the students. Instead, she told students to work with a partner, someone at their table or by themselves. She told students to look at each picture and choose the one they liked the best. Then, write sentences about the pictures. She did not define how many sentences students needed to write. Instead, she said to write as many sentences as you would like. |  |
| Observable: The directions allow the teacher to accurately see if students are meeting the expectation. | Responses will vary but should demonstrate how the teacher will provide directions that are observable. The teacher’s instructions were vague. She did not clearly define what students needed to be doing, making it difficult for students to know if they are following expectations and difficult for the teacher to assess if students are accurately meeting the expectations. |  |
