| Rationale/ Summary | Questioning is an essential tool for teachers both for instruction and for assessment. In this lesson, students will learn how to be strategic in their questioning and how to analyze questions for depth of thinking. | Questioning is an essential tool for teachers both for instruction and for assessment.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Review the lesson goal and the pre-planned questions. For each question, determine what information the teacher can learn and what their next steps might be. Evaluate the question set as a whole. Does the question set meet the characteristics of effective questions? Explain your reasoning. | Review the lesson goal and the pre-planned questions.

| 3 mins | Bellringer:  What are the characteristics of effective questions?  Why does the order and progression of questions matter for instruction based on the principles informed by the science of learning? | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | T: Let’s review our bellringer together. I’m going to ask for a volunteer to give me one characteristic of effective questions. Then that volunteer will call on a classmate to give the next. We will continue this process of one student calling on the next until we have answered both questions in their entirety.  T: Who would like to volunteer the first characteristic of effective questions?   S: (Volunteer shares a characteristic and calls on a classmate. Process continues until all characteristics have been shared and the second question has been fully answered by addressing the appropriate principles.)  T: (Use follow-up questions to support students if necessary.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 7 mins | Introduction to the Question Matrix  T: Now that we know why effective questioning is important, let’s look at a tool to help you evaluate the complexity of questions in a lesson and create your own additional question to supplement existing questions in a lesson plan. (Display Question Matrix slide.)  From: https://aliceleung.net/2017/09/03/asking-the-right-questions/  T: Notice the question words in the first column of the table and the verbs in the first row of the table. To create a question, a teacher can choose a question word followed by a verb. The lower you go on the question words and the farther to the right you go in the verbs, the more complex a teacher’s question are.   T: Let’s look at our bellringer questions from yesterday. Where would you place the first question: What is one characteristic of a tomato?   S: In the top left corner. In the first cell of the table.   T: And what does that tell us about its complexity?   S: It is not a complex question.   T: Where would you put the second question: How would you describe the relationship between characteristics and traits?   S: It would be on the bottom row, 4th column.   T: And what does that tell us about its complexity?   S: It is a complex question but not the most complex.   T: If we imagine that the first question is the first one asked in the lesson and the second question is the last, how do these questions align to our last characteristics of effective questioning?   S: The questions do increase in complexity over the course of the lesson since the last question is more complex than the first. The final question is aligned to the level of thinking required in the learning target. | Student Guide PPT |
| 8 mins | Practice 1: Question Evaluation – Part II  T: Before we move on, let’s do a little more practice with evaluating questions based on complexity and alignment to the level of thinking required in the learning target. Take a minute to complete Practice 1 on your own.  S: (Evaluate the question set and complete the graphic organizer.)  T: Let’s take a poll. How many of you thought the first criteria was met – that the questions increase in complexity over time?   S: (Raise their hands to indicate response.)  T: Would someone who raised their hand please explain your thinking?   S: (Volunteers to explain.)  T: (Ask additional questions and elicit additional responses to ensure students understand the correct answer.) What about the second criteria? Do the questions align to the level of thinking required by the learning target?  S: No, they don’t.  T: What is your reasoning?   S: The questions only ask students to consider the amount of one coin at a time. They are never required to consider total amount of more than one coin. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Discussion   T: Great. Now that we understand what makes a good question and what makes a good set of questions, let’s go back to what we know about assessment – especially formative assessment. What is the purpose of formative assessment for the teacher?   S: It helps the teacher gather information about student learning to help the teacher plan.   T: Yes. Let’s take a look at the two questions from yesterday’s bellringer again: What is one word characteristic of this tomato? And How would you describe the relationship between characteristics and traits? (Display questions on PPT or board.) T: What information can the teacher learn about student understanding based on the first question?   S: The teacher can learn whether or not students can identify specific characteristics of an object when asked to describe that object.  T: Why is that question important?  S: The teacher needs to know if they can describe a single object because they will be asked to compare/contrast objects in the next part of the lesson. The teacher also needs to know if students know what the word “characteristic” means.  T: And what might the teacher do if the students aren’t able to respond to her question about characteristics?  S: The teacher can give an example to help the students get started. The teacher can ask more specific questions to help the students get started – like what color is the tomato? The teacher can provide a definition of “characteristic.”  T: What about the second question? What is its purpose?   S: To determine whether the students have met the learning target.   T: And what can the teacher do if students aren’t able to answer this question?   S: The teacher will need to teach the lesson again in a new way or reteach the lesson to some students who did not get it the first time. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Lesson Analysis  T: Now it’s your turn. Review the remaining pre-planned question for the tomato lesson. We did the first and last one together. With a partner, complete the following activities for the rest of the questions:   Explain the purpose of the question – what the teacher might learn about student understanding. Identify next steps the teacher might take based on data collected.  S: (Work with a partner to complete the activity.)  T: (Circulate and support students as they work. Address common misconceptions or mistakes with the whole class.) | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: Why is it important to be intentional about questions?   S: They can be used to help students build knowledge. Asking them in the right way can help students focus on the most important content, connect to prior knowledge, and avoid overload. |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the exit ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
