| Understandable | Rules must be stated clearly and consistent with students’ age and ability level. | First Grade: Keep hands, feet, and objects to yourself.   This language is clear and would be easy for a first-grade student to understand. | First grade: Respect the personal space, belongings, and contributions of others. This language is not as appropriate or clear for a first-grade student. |

| Observable (Easy to monitor) | Rules should be easily monitored and not require excessive classroom time to hold students accountable. | Raise your hand to participate.   This rule is a behavior that is observable and easy to enforce without taking away instructional time. | Be brave and try new things   This would be difficult to observe or enforce as a rule. |

| Stated Positively | Stating rules positively encourages the desired behavior. Although it is sometimes difficult to state all rules positively, most “don’ts” can be transformed to “do’s.” | Arrive to class on time and ready to learn. The rule is framed positively. | Don’t come to class late or unprepared The rule is framed negatively. |

| Addresses the Most Important Expectations | Rules should represent high expectations for the key values of the class | Treat others with kindness.   This reflects an important value for the class that can be observed in many situations throughout the day. | Sharpen your pencil only at the beginning of class.   This rule is very specific to a behavior at a particular point of the day. |
