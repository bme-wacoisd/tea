| Rationale/ Summary | Questioning is an integral part of cognitive engagement and student learning. In this lesson, students will learn about the importance of student generated questions and explore the Question-Response-Relationship (QAR) strategy used to support students in responding to and developing their own questions. Students will learn about four question types and examine a passage and a set of questions to determine the question type. Students will then read a passage and generate their own questions about the passage and share with a small group. | Questioning is an integral part of cognitive engagement and student learning.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Studies have shown that 4-year-olds ask as many as 200-300 questions a day. Between the ages of 2-5, kids ask on average 40,000 questions! Why do you think it is important for students to ask questions? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Intro to Student Generated Questions  T: Student generated questions are questions developed by students to help demonstrate their understanding of the content being taught and direct their own learning to understanding more about the content.  T: Student generated questions are important because they require students to reflect on their knowledge and learning and develop a question from this knowledge.  T: As we discovered in the Science of Learning unit, questioning is an integral part of cognitive engagement and student learning.   T: How do meaningful and effective questions lead to cognitive engagement and increased understanding?   S: Using meaningful questions forces students to think critically and elaborate as opposed to providing a one-word response. It pushes students to make connections and draw on their prior knowledge and learning.  T: Let’s consider how a teacher can help students develop questions: Model explicitly how to ask good questions, Provide structured ways for students to ask questions, and Set expectations that asking questions is the norm in the classroom.   T: How do these ideas connect to what you learned in the Science of Learning and other units?  S: To learn, students need to be cognitively engaged and connect to prior knowledge. Also, high-quality teaching includes modeling and scaffolds, which is what students need to learn how to develop good questions. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Question-Answer-Relationship (QAR)  T: We are now going to explore the Question-Answer-Relationship (QAR) strategy as one structure that helps students begin to ask questions. Find the QAR one-pager in your student guide.   S: (Find QAR one-pager.)  T: Please take a few minutes to read through the information about QAR. I will set a timer for three minutes. (Set timer.)  S: (Read one-pager.)  T: What does QAR stand for?   S: Question-Answer-Relationship.   T: And why would a teacher want to teach students QAR?   S: Because it can help students identify question types and create their own questions.   T: Why is it important for students to know question types and to generate their own questions?   S: Knowing question types can help students figure out how to find answers and generating their own questions can increase motivation and curiosity.  T: Let’s look at an example of each of the four types of questions students might encounter when reading and responding to questions about a text. Find the sample text in your student guide.  S: (Find sample text.)  T: Take a minute to read the sample text and review the example questions.  S: (Read text and review example questions.)  T: Let’s look at four types of questions students might encounter. Based on the reading and the sample question, what do you think a “right there” question is?   S: A question whose answer is right there in the text.   T: What about think and search?   S: A question you must think a little bit more about. The answer might not be quite as obvious.   T: What is an author and me question?   S: One that includes something about what the author thinks and what the reader thinks.   T: And on my own?   S: A question students can answer on their own without the text.  T: Let’s learn a little more about the four types. (Explain each type of question one at a time as students record notes in the student guide).   T: Let’s connect these different question types to our previous learning by determining whether each question type is low level or high level, closed or open.   T: Do you think right there questions are high level or low level?  S: Low level because the answer can be found directly in the text.  T: Are right there questions open or closed?  S: Closed because there will probably only be one correct answer.  T: What about think and search?  S: Low level and closed. The answers are still found directly in the text and will likely have a limited number of correct answers.   T: What about author and me?  S: Higher level and open because the answer to the question cannot be found directly in the text. Students must combine information provided in the text with their own prior knowledge to create a response.  T: What about on my own?  S: Higher level and open because the answer to the question cannot be found directly in the text. This type of question requires students to use their background or prior knowledge to answer the question.   T: By first developing an understanding of the different types of questions and determining if they are higher/lower level and open/closed, students are more prepared to begin drafting their own questions that are increasingly more complex and require deeper thinking. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Teacher Model of QAR Strategy T: Let’s practice using these four different types of questions. As we review, I will play the role of the teacher and you all will be students in my classroom.  T: Independently read “Roly-Poly Pill Bugs” by Cynthia Sherwood. We are going to look at a few questions to determine which type of question they are.   T: (Allow 5 minutes for students to read the short passage.)  S: (Students read passage.)  T: Now, let’s look at some questions to determine if they are right there, think and search, author and me, or on my own questions.  T: (Share via PPT as students record notes in student guide.)  T: What type of question is this first question?  S: Right there because the answer can be found directly in the text.  T: Locate where you found the answer in the text.  T: Look at the next question.  T: What type of question is this?  S: On My Own because the answer cannot be found directly in the text. Students must use their own prior knowledge to answer the question.  T: Why wasn’t this an Author and Me question?  S: Because the question could be answered without reading the text. Students only needed to know what an opinion statement is.   T: We’ve looked at an example of a Right There questions and an On my Own question. Let’s see if we can create our own questions for Think and Search and Author and Me.  T: What are the characteristics of a Think and Search question?  S: The answers are found directly in the text but are gathered from several parts of the text and put together to make meaning.  T: I know that this passage talked a lot about the different creatures that were like the pill bug in some way, so one question I might ask is “In what ways is the pill bug similar to other creatures?”    T: Why is this an example of a Think and Search question?  S: The answer can be found in the text but must be gathered from different parts of the text and put together to make meaning.   T: Now, let’s create an Author and Me question.   T: What are the characteristics of an Author and Me question?  S:  These questions are based on information provided in the text, but the student is required to relate it to their own experience. Although the answer does not lie directly in the text, the student must have read it to answer the question.  T: One question might be, “Where would you be least likely to find a pill bug?”   T: Why is this an example of an Author and Me question?  S: The question is based on information provided in the text, but students must use their own prior knowledge and experience to answer the question.   T: Yes – to answer this question, students would need to first know the type of environment where pill bugs are found, which can be found in the text. Then, students would need to have a prior understanding of places that do and do not have this type of environment. | Student Guide Passage Source: https://www.superteacherworksheets.com/reading-comp/4th-pillbugs_WBDRW.pdf |
| 15 mins | Practice T: You are now going to practice developing your own questions for a passage.   T: First, you will independently read “Spitting to Survive” by Liana Mahoney.   T: You will work in groups of 4. Each student in your group will focus on one question type. Each person will draft two questions for their assigned question type based on the passage to present to their small group.   T: (Assign each student in the group a question type and allow time for students to read and complete the activity).  T: Now that you have created your questions, you will share your questions with your group. Begin with Right There questions. You have two minutes for Right There questions.  S: (Presenter shares two right there questions and then asks the group to generate more.)    T: You will now continue with the Think and Search, Author, and Me, and On My Own. Each round will last two minutes.  S: (Students will complete activity in the student guide). | Student Guide Passage Source: https://www.superteacherworksheets.com/reading-comp/5th-spitting-animals_WBFFF.pdf |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: How did it feel to develop your own questions for the different question types?  S: Student responses will vary.  T: Which question type posed the most challenge? Why?  S: (Student responses will vary but will likely allude to the Author and Me and On my Own being the most difficult to create because they require students to use both the text and prior knowledge.)  T: How did generating your own questions deepen your understanding of the content in the passage?  S: Generating questions required more cognitive effort because we had to reflect on our prior knowledge and learning from the text to develop a question. This required us to have a deeper understanding of the information in the text.   T: When might a teacher use this strategy?   S: When they want students to understand what kind of information is needed to answer a particular question and where and how to find that information. When a teacher wants to encourage student curiosity. | Student Guide |
