Date:
Reflect on the lesson planning process and your performance while delivering the lesson. Identify the UDL strategies you used and explain how those strategies support the needs of all the students, including individuals and small subgroups, such as English Language Learners and gifted students.
Student responses will vary based on lesson taught and UDL strategies incorporated.


How does the use of these strategies differ from an approach that teaches to the average student?
Student responses should reference that providing multiple means of engagement, representation, and action and expression minimizes barriers and maximizes learning by ensuring that all learners can access and participate in meaningful, challenging learning opportunities. UDL supports the idea that all students learn best through the use of multiple methods that encourages active cognitive processing and promotes meaningful learning.
