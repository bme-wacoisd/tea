It helps students to know what to expect throughout the lesson as well as what they will need to learn and be able to do at the end of the lesson. The lesson standard shows the purpose of the lesson, the I can statements clearly explain what students need to do in the lesson and the agenda helps to show them how they will learn it or practice it.


#### Notes: Focus on Instructional Outcomes


How Focusing on Instructional Outcomes Benefits Students
- Communicates what students need to know and be able to do
- Provides criteria for success in instructional tasks
- Helps to ensure that students are focusing on the most important content
How Focusing on Instructional Outcomes Benefits Teachers
- Helps to make sure activities and practice are aligned to learning outcomes
- Ensure that all students are challenged by learning outcomes
4 Ways Teachers Make Instructional Outcomes Clear for Students
Making the instructional outcomes visible for students
Reviewing instructional outcomes with students at the beginning of the lesson
Returning to the instructional outcomes throughout the lesson as a formative check
Reviewing the instructional outcomes at the conclusion of the lesson
#### Characteristics of Quality “I can” statements

Use student-friendly language
Focus on one key skill or concept
Are measurable
Process for Writing “I can” statements
Start with the standard: Determine what instructional standard you will focus on during the lesson.
Break the standard apart in to smaller, measurable skills. Try to keep one skill per “I can” statement.
Describe each skill in a statement beginning with the phrase “I can”.  Check to make sure the statement uses language appropriate for the level of students.

Teacher Model 1:  Quality “I can” statements

#### Student Practice: Writing “I can” statements

Choose one of the lesson standards below and write at least two “I can” statements to represent the skills required in the lesson standard.
Choose one:

Write down the “I can” statements shared by the group.  Use the table below to record feedback from the group based on the criteria for quality “I can” statements.






|  | Statement | Criteria for Quality “I can” statements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Example | I can accurately find the words or phrases from texts that supports my answer | Uses student friendly language, focuses on one skill and is measurable because teacher can see the student demonstrating this skill by having the student to write the words/phrases from the text that support the student’s answer |
| Non-Example | I can use more complex media to express an idea and expand my knowledge of the tools and techniques with attention to craftsmanship. | Not an example because it uses complex language and focuses on more than one skill.  It may be measurable but would take different assessments to measure. |
