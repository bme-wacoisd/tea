Bellringer:
The concept of effective feedback was introduced in the science of learning unit. Use what you remember from the unit to answer the following questions:
How does feedback improve learning?
Feedback helps students to figure out what they know and don’t know.  Specific feedback can help students to know how they can improve.
What are some key elements of effective feedback?
Feedback should be specific and clear, focus on the task not the student, provide strengths and areas to improve and be timely.


#### Introduction to Types of Feedback





#### Example: Feedback


Directions:  As you watch the video clip, write down examples of feedback statements in the chart below.

Practice:  Types & Characteristics of Effective Feedback
Scenario 1:  Ms. Rodriguez, a Spanish I teacher, asked her class to practice their conversational Spanish skills with a partner to share information about personal celebrations.  Tomas, a student in the class, received the following feedback from Ms. Rodriguez at the end of class regarding his conversation.

What type of feedback did Tomas receive from Ms. Rodriguez? (Formal or Informal, Written or Verbal)
The feedback was formal and written.
How does the feedback that Tomas received align with the characteristics of effective feedback? (Specific and clear, Focused on the Task, Strengths, and Improvements, Timely and Actionable)
The feedback was provided immediately after class, making it timely.  The feedback received highlighted positives through the bright spot statements as well as clear and specific information about how to improve.
Scenario 2: Mrs. Foglesong is a middle school PE teacher who is teaching students the technique for an overhead throw.  The students have learned the steps for throwing overhand using the acronym ‘LASTE’.  Mrs. Foglesong asked the students to practice throwing overhead using bean bags in groups.  Watch the video provided below and analyze the feedback she is giving students.
Mrs. Foglesong-MS PE Lesson (8:35-10:37)
What type of feedback did the students receive from Mrs. Foglesong? (Formal or Informal, Written or Verbal)
The feedback was verbal and informal.
How does the feedback that the students received align with the characteristics of effective feedback? (Specific and clear, Focused on the Task, Strengths and Improvements, Timely and Actionable)
The teacher circulated around the gym and provided feedback to students they were working.  The feedback allowed the students to fix their errors immediately.  She identified strengths as well as looked for ways for students to improve.  She routinely reinforced the steps using the acronym when providing feedback, making it specific and clear and focused on the task/criteria for success.


| Type of Feedback | Description | When? | How its delivered? | Purpose? | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Informal | Delivered in the moment, tailored to the situation, not provided equally to all students | During instruction/learning | Verbally provided by the teacher | Move learning/instruction forward, formative | Teacher circulates to evaluate progress on independent student work and provides corrections as necessary |
| Formal | Planned and systematically scheduled into the learning process.  It is provided consistently for each student. | After instruction/learning | Written or verbal provided by the teacher | Measure learning against standards, summative | Grades on summative assessments, comments on report cards, student/teacher conferences |
| Written | Feedback that is provided to as student in written form after a task has been completed. | After Instruction | Written, provided by teacher | Provides a record of what a student is doing well, allows students to return to feedback to make revisions | Feedback provided on a presentation via a rubric |
| Verbal | Immediate feedback provided to a student verbally during instruction. | During Instruction/After Instruction | Verbal, spoken by teacher | Allows for quick and instant correction; allows for a dialogue (clarification) | Teacher provides information to a student who worked a problem at the board about what was done well; Teacher/student conferences |


| Feedback Statements Observed: |
| --- |
| “I want to point out and brag on my friend Landon because when he was drawing his circles, he made sure not to put them too close together.”   “He used his pointing finger to count so he didn’t lose track” |
| Is this feedback an example of formal or informal feedback? Written or Verbal? |
| Informal and verbal |
| How does the feedback given by the teacher align with the characteristics of effective feedback? |
| The feedback was specific and clear.  It focused on the task that Landon completed, not on him.  It also was timely.  It identified strengths, but not necessarily areas to improve. |
| Was it the right type of feedback to provide in this scenario? How did this feedback allow learning to progress/move forward? |
| Yes, the feedback was more effective in the moment and since Landon was the only one demonstrating it made sense to only give feedback to him.  The purpose of the feedback was to reinforce good practices for drawing a picture and counting to solve a problem.  The student was successful in the task, so the teacher was able to affirm those practices that made him successful.  This helps students to understand the important practices to replicate for success. |
