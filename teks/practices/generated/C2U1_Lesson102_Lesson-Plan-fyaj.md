| Rationale/ Summary | While systems and routines are important for building a strong classroom culture, building connections among students and between students and teacher is also a foundational element of classroom culture. In this lesson, students will practice systems and routines while making connections with one another to ensure that all students feel a sense of belonging in the classroom. | While systems and routines are important for building a strong classroom culture, building connections among students and between students and teacher is also a foundational element of classroom culture.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Answer the questions below. If a new student joined our classroom, how would you explain our routine for beginning class? Identify and describe two ice-breakers that we discussed today. Identify the following statements as true or false. If a statement is false, correct it. The only reason to do ice-breakers is to help the teacher learn student names. Students feel a sense of respect, rapport, and belonging in a strong classroom culture. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Answer the questions below. If a new student joined our classroom, how would you explain our routine for beginning class?

|  | Prepare to share the video Designing Classroom Systems – Sarah Wright with students. | PowerPoint |
|  | Complete the bellringer prior to the start of class so that you can share your responses with students during the Warm-Up. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Respond to the questions below. What is most important for others to know about you?  What is your preferred name (first and last)? Who is in your family?  What are your favorite hobbies and pastimes outside of school?  What is your best or favorite subject in school? Why?  What are your top favorite things to eat?  What are your top favorite places to go?  What can be challenging for you?  What is a unique skill you have (something you can do well)? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice: Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up T: We’re going to begin by reviewing the routine we learned yesterday: how to get into pairs. I will ask you to Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up. Can I have a volunteer explain how this routine works?  S: When you say Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up, we stand up, and we each put one hand in the air. We look around and find someone else who also has their hand in the air. We go to them and give them a high-five. That means we’re in a pair.  T: After you use the Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up routine to locate a partner, you should show your answers to the bellringer to them. Try to identify something you have in common. After two minutes, I’ll ask you to Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair up again. You’ll find a new partner and do the same thing: show them your bellringer responses and work together to identify something you have in common.  T: I have done the bellringer as well, so I’ll have my Hand Up to look for a partner to share.   T: We’ll do four rounds with different partners. Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up!  S: (Use the Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up routine to find a partner. Partners show their completed bellringer to each other and discuss responses they have in common.)  T: (Times this round of partner discussions for two minutes).  T: Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up!  S: (Use the Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up routine to find a different partner. Partners show their completed bellringer to each other and discuss responses they have in common.)  T: (Times this round of partner discussions for two minutes).  T: Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up!  S: (Use the Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up routine to find a different partner. Partners show their completed bellringer to each other and discuss responses they have in common.)  T: Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up!  S: (Use the Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up routine to find a different partner.

S: (Use the Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up routine to find a different partner. Partners show their completed bellringer to each other and discuss responses they have in common.)  T: Thank you for practicing this important part of our classroom routine. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Using Ice-Breakers to Build Relationships T: In our last activity, we used one of our classroom routines to complete an ice-breaker. An ice-breaker is an activity that helps “warm up” conversation among a group of people.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: We did an ice-breaker because it helps us get to know one another. There are many ice-breakers that teachers can use to build their own relationships with students and help students build relationships with each other. Let’s add our activity to the list of ice-breaker examples.  S: (Add to list of examples in Student Guide.)  T: One of the activities we did yesterday is considered an ice-breaker. Which activity was that?  S: When we did Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up and shared the stories about our names.  T: Asking students to share information about their names is one example of an ice-breaker. The teacher should participate as well.  S: (Add to list of examples in Student Guide.)  T: Another option is Eight Nouns. In this activity, everyone shares eight nouns that best describe themselves. Through Eight Nouns, we learn about the important roles that we each play in our home and school communities.  S: (Add to list of examples in Student Guide.)  T: A fourth example is Five Pictures. Everyone selects and shares five pictures that show what is important to them. We learn about what everyone in the class values.   S: (Add to list of examples in Student Guide.)  T: Next, we’re going to dig deeper. We’ll look at why it’s important build strong relationships. |  |
| 10 mins | Notes: Creating Classroom Culture T: The strength of our relationships strongly influences our classroom culture, which is the environment and tone of a classroom that impacts how students feel during instruction.  S: (Add definition to graphic organizer.)  T: There are several factors that determine our classroom culture. We discussed one of them yesterday: the systems and routines that we use. Can I have a volunteer share the definition of systems and routines so that we can add it to the Student Guide?  S:  Clear and consistent structures in a classroom that help students execute recurring activities correctly and efficiently.  S: (Add definition to graphic organizer.)  T: Today, we have discussed ways to build relationships. These relationships help establish rapport, respect, and belonging.   T: Rapport is a sense of understanding between people. Respect is regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others. Belonging is a sense of being seen and accepted by a group.  S: (Add definitions to graphic organizer.)  T: These four elements work in partnership to create a strong classroom culture. They reinforce each other. As an example, consider the routine we discussed for whole-group discussions yesterday. Which of these elements of classroom culture does it address?  S: We show that we respect others by letting people finish their thoughts before we add anything.  T: Let’s build the connection between classroom culture and learning. If there is a strong classroom culture, what will happen to the opportunity for student success?  S: It will go up.  S: (Complete box in Student Guide.) |  |
| 5 mins | Practice: Video Review T: We’re going to watch a short classroom video. As you watch, answer the questions in the video viewing questions section of your Student Guide.  T: (Play video.)  S: (Respond to viewing questions in Student Guide.) | Designing Classroom Systems – Sarah Wright |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: We’re going to come back to this video in a later class.  T: Today, we started class with an ice-breaker. What was that ice-breaker?  S: The questions in the bellringer.  T: What was the goal of that ice-breaker?  S: To help us build relationships with each other and you.  T: Why do we want to build relationships with each other?  S: Relationships help us develop rapport, respect, and belonging.  T: Why do those matter?  S: Because they help us have a strong classroom culture. |  |
