| 5 mins | Bellringer: What is different about being a teenager or young adult now than when your parents or grandparents were teenagers?  How can schools to help prepare students to be successful in this changing world? | Student Guide PPT |
| 8 mins | Partner Brainstorm: Bellringer Reflection T: Turn and talk with a partner. Together you will brainstorm the lists you created during your bellringer. You’ll have five minutes to come up with a combined list, and then we will come together as a class to discuss. S: (Collaborate with partners for two minutes to combine lists.) T: (Allow five minutes to pass.) T: Let’s discuss some of our ideas around this question, “What is different about being a teenager or young adult now than when your parents or grandparents were teenagers?” S: (Share their ideas from the bellringer and partner discussion.) T: How can schools help to prepare students to be successful in this changing world? S: (Share their ideas from the bellringer and partner discussion.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 2 mins | Carousel Notes Introduction T: Today we’re going to participate in Carousel Protocol to discuss the value of teachers in a changing world. We will focus on three key factors:  How teachers help to prepare students for financial and job stability, How teachers help students to develop critical thinking skills, and  How teachers prepare students to live and excel in society. T: Find the Carousel Protocol graphic organizer in your Student Guide.  S: (Locate graphic organizer in Student Guide.) T: You and your partners will rotate stations where you will read a brief information sheet and have a discussion based around the prompts in your Student Guide. Additionally, there is space for you to take notes about things that stand out to you. You will have five minutes at each station. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Carousel Protocol: The Value of Teachers in a Changing World T: (Rotate students through three stations where they will read a brief information sheet and have a discussion around their topic.)  S: (Participate in Carousel Protocol by discussing questions and making notes in their student guides.) | Student Guide Protocol Articles |
| 10 min | Debrief   T: There are many reasons why teaching and education matter. Education is a key component to a functioning society. Without teachers and education, it would be challenging to create skilled workers to enter the workforce, individuals would struggle to think critically, and it would be more challenging for people from different backgrounds to work together. T: Let’s review each of these areas where teachers add value to society and reflect on what you noticed from the notes and your group discussions. T: (Lead students through a discussion of the activity and the notes they took in their Student Guide.) S: (Share out about their experience in the Carousel Protocol and their thoughts on the value of teachers in a changing society.) T: As our society develops and grows, it is important for teachers to understand the different needs of learners, especially in preparation to enter the workforce as an adult who can work well with others, find innovative solutions to complex problems. While not every student may know what they want to do as a career after high school, it is important for teachers to instill the skills necessary to excel at whatever career they eventually choose. |  |
