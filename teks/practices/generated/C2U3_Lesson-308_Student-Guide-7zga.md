How do relationships with trusted adults help students in school?

Outside of your immediate family, who is the adult in your life do you trust the most? Why do you trust them?



Introduction to School Community Support Roles

#### Practice: Ms. L / Joslyn


Ms. L is a first-year teacher. Over the course of the first few weeks of school, she gets to know her students and learns a lot about them. She is struggling to connect with Joslyn, who often seems uninterested in class. Joslyn confided in Ms. L that she is periodically homeless and often goes without food. When she comes to school, she is hungry and falls asleep during class. Students make fun of her because of her appearance. She often comes to school with dirty or ripped clothes. She said that the only class she enjoys is art class. When she arrives to school in the mornings, she frequently stops by the library to exchange books. Ms. L wants to know how to better engage Joslyn and help her become successful. With whom should Ms. L arrange meetings? Why?



#### Practice: Scenario Analysis

Read the scenarios below. Who might each teacher go to in the school to get support? What questions might the teacher ask each of their colleagues?

Scenario 1: Janie is a student in Ms. M’s 5th grade history class. Janie maintained good grades through most of elementary school but now that school is getting more complicated, she is beginning to struggle. She often forgets to turn in her homework and her notebook is a mess. She is disorganized and can never find her notes or handouts. She often forgets to take information home to her parents and she doesn’t do well on history tests or quizzes. Ms. M hears that Janie is doing well in her science class. She also knows that Janie has a study period with a math enhancement teacher and is doing well in math class. Who can Ms. M go to for help and what questions might she ask?




Scenario 2: Eduardo is a student in Mr. O’s math class. Mr. O has noticed that he does very well solving independent math problems, but he struggles when it comes to word problems. He isn’t always able to identify the most important information and he gets confused in setting up number representations based on the word problems. Since English was not Eduardo’s primary language, he used to receive services through an ELL teacher. Recently he has graduated from that program and is no longer receiving those services in school, but still seems close to his former ELL teacher. He enjoys playing baseball after school but is not on the baseball team.  Who can Mr. O go to for help?
