| Rationale/ Summary | In this lesson, the last student will practice delivering the lessons they were introduced to and studied and get feedback on their lesson delivery.  Additionally, this lesson will give the students an opportunity to reflect on teaching their first lesson and the necessity for instructional alignment. Please note that you will need to set up stations for this lesson. You will need: Enough stations to accommodate groups of three White board space for writing on the board for each group Printed lesson materials | In this lesson, the last student will practice delivering the lessons they were introduced to and studied and get feedback on their lesson delivery.

| 3 mins | Bellringer: Yesterday you agreed to these norms for practice.  T: (Project norms on board from student guide.)  Please reflect using the following questions: Were you successful in sticking to the norms in the rehearsals yesterday? Reflecting on your experience yesterday, are there any additional norms that you would add to the list? Reflecting on your experience yesterday, why do you think establishing norms for how teacher’s work together is important? | Student Guide PPT |
| 2 mins | T: Please share your thoughts on each of these bell ringer questions. S: (Students reflect on norms.) T: (Record any modifications to the norms.) T: In much the same that we set and revisit norms, practicing teachers also use norm setting to help them do collaborative work together or study lesson delivery. | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Round Three: Practice Teach  T: (Set up stations around the room – a number to accommodate groups of three and, if possible, give each triad access to a section of white board.  Alternatively, students can use a personal white board, projected computer or even a sheet of paper for sections of the lesson that involve writing.)  T: The last teacher from your group will get to practice their lesson today.   T: (Send students back to their groups of three; ensure that students take their lesson materials when they move into groups.)  S: (Students move back to their groups of three.)  T:  I want to quickly recap the process we used from yesterday.  T: (Display PPT.) Our time will be broken up in the following way:  Rehearsal Plan 9 minutes to teach the lesson with other two classmates acting as students. 4 minutes to record reflections on your experience, using either the teacher reflection table or the student reflection table in your student guide. 2 minutes to share warm and cool feedback with the teacher. 2 minutes for the teacher to reflect on teaching the lesson  T: Alright, let’s conduct another round.  We will start with 9 minutes of rehearsal teaching.  T: (Display timer with 9 minutes giving the third “teachers” a chance to teach their lesson using the above timing.)  T: Begin teaching your lesson!  S: (Students engage in lesson rehearsal.)  T: (At 9 minutes, teacher stops the rehearsing teachers.)  T: Now let’s move to 4 minutes to record reflections in the teacher table or the student table in your student guide.  S: (Students reflect in their guides for 4 minutes.)  T: Now I’d ask those of you who participated as students to share some of the warm and cool feedback with your teacher.  Be as specific as possible.  S: (Students share warm and cool feedback for the teacher.)  T: Finally, let’s give the teacher a chance to share their reflections on the experience of teaching the lesson.  S: (“Teacher” shares their reflection on the lesson.) | Student Guide  PPT Sample Lessons |
| 15 mins | Reflecting  T: Finally, today, I’d like us to reflect on and debrief the practice together. During this debrief, I’d like you to share about your own experiences or any feedback that you received from your “students.” Do not share warm or cool feedback about those who taught you.  T: As we discuss, I will capture our collective experiences on the white board in a three-column chart that is parallel to the focus areas we looked for in the reflection tables – directions, direct instruction, and practice and formative assessment.  Please use the class debrief reflection table to take notes in your student guide to capture our discussion.  T: First, let’s discuss directions.  As we learned early, giving clear directions is vital so that students know exactly what they should do during any part of a lesson. Referring back to your reflections and the feedback you heard from your students, what successes and challenges did you experience with giving directions?  S: (Students share their experiences.)  T: (Chart students’ responses in the table.)  T: The second focus area was direct instruction, where you deliver the content that students are to learn. What successes and challenges did you experience with direct instruction?  S: (Students share their experiences.)  T: (Chart students’ responses in the table.)  T: Let’s reflect on practice and formative assessment.  What successes and challenges did you experience with practice and formative assessment?  S: (Students share their experiences.)  T: (Chart students’ responses in the table.)  T: Finally, how did you experience alignment in the lessons you delivered? Were they aligned and how do you know?  S: (Students share their experiences.)  T: (Chart students’ responses in the table.)  T: I appreciate all your reflections on your rehearsal teaching and experiences.  What have these days taught you about why it is important to prepare to teach when you have a curriculum and lesson plans?  S: (Answers will vary. Highlight answers such as: We couldn’t have taught well without knowing what was in the lesson; thinking about what we wanted students to understand, what order activities would come in, and making sure we gave clear directions could only happen if we read and practiced the lessons. You can’t just wing it. You need to know exactly how it will go, what you will do, and what you want your students to do.)  In many ways, this reflective activity serves as a helpful formative assessment of your experience with teaching and gives both you and I a sense of successes and challenges that we will build on as we rehearse moving forward. | Student Guide |
