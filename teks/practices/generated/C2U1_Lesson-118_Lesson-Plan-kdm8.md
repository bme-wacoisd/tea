| Rationale/ Summary | Investment in classroom systems is worthwhile so students know how to set themselves up for academic success with minimal teacher intervention. It is also important that you ensure classroom systems operate at a level of excellence sufficient to serve the learning needs of the classroom.  In this lesson, students will learn how the Do It Again technique can be used to inspire students to go from good to great using the Good, Better, Best and the Manage Affect variations.   This is the second of three lessons on the Do It Again technique. In this lesson, students will learn about two variations of the Do It Again technique, watch the variations in action, determine situations when they might use the variations, and practice using the different variations through role play. | Investment in classroom systems is worthwhile so students know how to set themselves up for academic success with minimal teacher intervention.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Directions: Read the following scenario. Create a draft response using the Do It Again technique to set a standard of excellence.   Scenario: You’ve just posed a question, and every hand in your classroom is raised to answer. You send students to a Turn and Talk to give everyone a chance to process their thinking, and the volume sounds more like recess than learning time.  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Directions: Read the following scenario. Create a draft response using the Do It Again technique to set a standard of excellence.

|  | Prior to beginning the lesson, ensure you can access the videos: Sarah Ott and Erica Lim |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Why is it important for a teacher to manage their tone and body language when delivering a Do It Again statement?   Why is it important to focus on economy of language when delivering a Do It Again Statement?   Why is it important to pause students as close as possible to the moment when you see the class make a mistake? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Video T: There are three variations of the Do It Again technique from Texas Teach Like a Champion Online. They are: Good, Better, Best; Manage Affect; and Specific Feedback.  T: Today we’re going to talk about the first two: Good, Better, Best; and Manage Affect.   T: What do you think of when you hear the term “Good, Better, Best”?  S: Answers will vary.  T: You might think of something that is acceptable, something that is desirable, and something that is exceptional. We want our students to feel exceptional, and that starts with our expectations of them in the classroom.   T: Good, Better, Best shows students they can take something good and make it truly great. This variation is often delivered with a spirit of challenge, and students usually execute with high levels of enthusiasm.  T: Turn to your Student Guide and find the video notes graphic organizer. We’re going to watch a TLAC video from a teacher named Sarah Ott. She is going to model Good, Better, Best.   T: We will watch the video twice. The first time we watch it, I just want you to pay attention to what Ms. Ott is doing in her classroom. You do not need to write anything this first time.  T: (Shows video.)  S: (Watch video.)  T: This time when we watch the video, I want you to make notes of what you notice as Ms. Ott challenged the students to work out the problem with even greater speed.  T: (Shows video.)  S: (Watch video and take notes)  T: What are some things you noticed?  S: Answers will vary.  T: The next variation we’re going to discuss is Manage Affect. This is a strategy used to tweak the energy level or attitude with which students have completed a task.  T: We’re going to watch a TLAC video from a teacher named Erica Lim. Just like last time, we’ll watch the video twice. I don’t want you to take any notes the first time.   T: (Shows video.)  S: (Watch video.)  T: This time, I want you to pay attention to how Ms. Lim effectively uses techniques to tweak the energy level and/or attitude with which the students have completed the task. Write down what you notice in your graphic organizer.  T: What did you notice?  S: Answers will vary.  T: What are some similarities you noticed between the two strategies?  S: Answers will vary but may include: Both teachers used positive tone and language – avoid phrases, such as “that was very sloppy.” Instead, focus on a more positive approach, such as “Oooh, let’s line up again and prove why we are the best class in the school.” | Student Guide PowerPoint Videos Sarah Ott Erica Lim |
| 5 mins | Role Play: Create a Scenario T: You’re going to have the opportunity to practice one of these two variations in groups of 2-3.  T: Before we move into groups, spend the next five minutes coming up with your own classroom scenario where you might need to use a Good, Better, Best or Manage Affect strategy. Write out the scenario and what you would do.  An example would be: You use your System Cue “Eyes” to get your class to look at you for instructions, however several students did not follow the cue. How do you use a Do It Again technique to get them on track?  S: (Create their scenario.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Role Play: Present & Peer Feedback T: Next, we are going to take ten minutes to practice. Move to your groups of 2-3. S: (Move to groups.) T: When you’re practicing, read your scenario to your group mates and then practice the Do It Again strategy you selected as though your group mates were students. Everyone in the group should take turns presenting.  T: When you are not the presenter, please give feedback by using the rubric in your Student Guide. S: (Practice delivering their Do It Again strategy.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: How did it feel to be the teacher in the scenario?  S: Answers will vary T: What was challenging for you? Answers will vary T: How does the use of these Do It Again techniques build culture and accountability? S: They help hold the group accountable in a reasonable and nonpunitive way for the behavior of all students. Students feel they are in a culture where they can hold each other accountable. A classroom culture of compliance and acceptable is replaced with excellence. T: How does the use of these Do It Again techniques help ensure students end with success? S: They helps build muscle memory by providing students the opportunity to practice expectations repeatedly. Additionally, students end the routine by doing it the right way, which leaves students with the memory of what right looks like. | Student Guide |
