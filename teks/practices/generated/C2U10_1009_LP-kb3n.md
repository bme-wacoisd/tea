| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | It is important for a teacher mentor to have a lot in common with their mentee so they can establish a relationship.  Mentor teachers usually have several years of experience and can provide guidance to their mentees about academics, classroom management, stress management, work-life balance, and a variety of other topics.  Mentees should not reach out to their mentor teachers with questions since mentor teachers are usually very busy. They should wait for their mentors to reach out to them.  If a beginning teacher is doing a good job, they no longer need a mentor teacher.  Only beginning teachers need mentors.  Mentors often learn as much from their mentees as they teach them.  All mentorships are formal, documented processes. | It is important for a teacher mentor to have a lot in common with their mentee so they can establish a relationship.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Think about a time in your life when you were learning a new skill (such as how to play piano) or were new to a group (such as your first day in a karate class). How did you feel during that time? Did you have anyone who guided you through that process until you felt comfortable on your own?  If yes, how did that person help? If no, why do you think it could have been helpful to have someone to help guide you? | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Introduction to Mentorship: T: Today we’re going to talk about mentorship and what that means for teachers. Before we do, let’s review your bellringer. Have you ever had a person who helped guide you when you were new at something? S: (Answers will vary.) T: When you’re new at something it is important to find others who can guide you. We call these people mentors.  or. We’re going to talk about mentor relationships as they apply to teachers. We have two new vocabulary words today, mentor teacher and mentee teacher.  S: (Write down definitions of mentor and mentee teacher in their student guide graphic organizer.) T: Will someone volunteer to read our two definitions? S: (Reads the definitions)  T: First, let’s look at the role of the mentor teacher—who are mentor teachers, what is their role, and how do they benefit from the mentorship? T: Now let’s look at the role of the mentee teacher. T: Mentorship can be both formal and informal. Formal mentorship may be offered to a teacher during their first few years as a teacher, or when they move grade levels, content areas, or schools. Informal mentorship often occurs when colleagues establish trusting relationships from their own interactions.  T: There are some best practices to remember when considering a professional relationship with colleagues. These are important things to remember as you develop collegial practices. Both the mentor and the mentee should agree that the purpose of the mentorship is the continuous improvement of teaching practices. Professionalism, including boundaries about confidentiality, time commitment, and communication, is essential to an effective relationship.  The mentor and mentee should agree on the norms and processes for feedback and observation. T: Considering the importance of mentorship and how to build effective relationships will not only be helpful to you in the future, but also as you continue to build relationships with your field placement teachers. T: As we start thinking more of how to develop professional relationships, especially before you enroll in the Practicum course, it is important to think about how you will build rapport with your field placement teacher and create a mentor/mentee style relationship. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Creating a Mentee Plan: T: As a mentee, one of the most important parts of creating an effective relationship with your mentor is knowing what kinds of questions to ask. For that reason, I have provided you with nine question categories that can help you get to better know your mentor and their approach to teaching. I want you to take ten minutes and draft at least two questions for each category. If you have additional questions, you can add another column or write them on the margins.  T: We’ll come together after 10 minutes and discuss the next steps. S: (Begin drafting their questions.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Mentee Plan Partner Feedback: T: Now that you’ve had a chance to draft your questions, I want you to partner with no more than two other people. In your groups of 2-3, I want you to review each other’s questions and provide feedback. In doing so, you will help your partner(s) narrow down to one question in each category, for a total of nine questions they’d like to ask their mentor teacher. T: Are there any questions? S: (Ask clarifying questions, if any.) T: You have ten minutes. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief:   T: Now that you’ve had the chance to narrow down to nine questions, you will save them to add as an artifact in your portfolio. That way, at the start of the Practicum course you will already have questions available to ask your mentor teacher. What are some of the questions you came up with? S: (Answers will vary, students should share questions.) |  |
