Read the two scenarios below and answer the questions.
Scenario A
Ms. Yalta’s class is engaged in independent work when she notices that one student is playing with his pencil case.  She circulates the classroom for a moment before approaching the off-task student.  She then crouches down and quietly says, in a warm and neutral tone, “Eyes on me, please.  During independent work time, it’s important that you stay focused.  Pick up your pencil and resume working on question 3.  Thank you.”
Scenario B
During independent reading time, Mr. Koluski notices that a student is playing with his pencil case.  From his desk Mr. Koluski loudly exclaims, “Micah, stop playing with your pencil case!”

- What evidence from the Five Keys of Individual Correction shows that Scenario A is a Private Individual Correction?




- In Scenario B, what affect will the teacher’s actions likely have on Micah? On the class as a whole?



- What might the teacher have done differently in Scenario B?
