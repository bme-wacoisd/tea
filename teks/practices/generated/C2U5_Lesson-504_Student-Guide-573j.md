### Lesson 5.04: Introduction to Informal Formative Assessment Strategies

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Review the scenario below. Place a carrot (^) in the lesson plan anywhere you think would be a good spot for a formative assessment. Then, use the graphic organizer below to explain your reasoning.

Mr. N. is teaching his second graders a lesson about solids and liquids. By the end of the lesson, he’d like his students to be able to define solids and liquids, categorize objects as either solid or liquid, and create a claim about the differences between solids and liquids. When students enter the classroom, Mr. N. asks them to take out their notebooks and asks them to copy the definitions of solid and liquid from the board. Mr. N. shows an example of a solid and a liquid and then models a think-aloud to show students how he determines whether a number of additional items are liquids or solids. Then he puts students into small groups to rotate through various stations. At each station, there is a new material to explore and categorize. Students have a graphic organizer to complete as they rotate, and Mr. N. guides the class in a discussion after students have visited all stations. The discussion focuses on what students noticed about the samples, how they categorized the samples, and the main differences between the samples. At the end of the discussion, Mr. N. is satisfied that students are ready to move to the next lesson.



Introduction to Informal Formative Assessment Strategies
Take notes about the strategies below.


#### Practice 1: Scenario Analysis

Read the scenarios below. For each, choose an informal formative assessment strategy and explain your thinking.



|  | Why is an assessment needed? | What information should be gathered? | How might the information inform next steps? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ^1 |  |  |  |
| ^2 |  |  |  |
| ^3 |  |  |  |


| Strategy | Description | When/Why/How | Benefits / Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Thumbs up, down, sideways |  |  |  |
| Red, yellow, green cards |  |  |  |
| Fist to five |  |  |  |
| White boards |  |  |  |
| Think-Pair-Share |  |  |  |
| Four Corners |  |  |  |
| Quick Poll |  |  |  |


| Scenario | Strategy | Reasoning |

| Ms. P. has just provided her students with instructions for their groupwork. Before she moves them into groups, she wants to be sure they are confident in their understanding of what they are supposed to do. What informal assessment might Ms. P. use? |  |  |
| Ms. P. wants to monitor group progress during their groupwork. She knows that some of the stations groups will visit can be a little tricky. Because groups will be at different stations at different times, she doesn’t want to stop the whole class to clarify instructions or content. She also knows that some groups have student leaders who will be able to help maneuver their groups through the tricky spots. She will need to monitor the various groups to identify which ones are beginning to feel stuck and when they can no longer move forward without her so she can prioritize her time. What informal assessment might Ms. P. use? |  |  |
| Ms. P.’s students have a test coming up. As a part of a test review, Ms. P. would like to see how they do on some of the test questions but would also like to hear their reasoning so she can identify misconceptions to address in the days before the test. What informal assessment might Ms. P. use? |  |  |
| As a warm-up before a lesson on division, Ms. P. wants to see how her class does on simple multiplication problems. She’s looking to see how quickly they can complete these problems and how accurate their responses are. What informal assessment might Ms. P. use? |  |  |
