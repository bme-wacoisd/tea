| Rationale/ Summary | Strong Voice is a technique for adjusting your speech and body language to ensure students listen carefully to what you say.  Teachers can establish formal register by adjusting their speech and body language to signal that what they are saying is important.  "Register" describes the tenor of your communication with others. Effective teachers modulate register purposefully to maximize student attention.  Highly effective teachers understand the impact of register on their students and move between the casual, formal, and urgent registers with intentionality. | Strong Voice is a technique for adjusting your speech and body language to ensure students listen carefully to what you say.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will analyze two brief scenarios to determine the following: Identify the register used by the teacher. Determine if it was the appropriate register. Why or why not? Describe the impact of the teacher’s register choice on the classroom environment. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Students will analyze two brief scenarios to determine the following: Identify the register used by the teacher.

|  | Prior to beginning this lesson, ensure that you can access the Vimeo video Formal Register: Teach Like a Champion Team |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:   T:  Turn to a neighbor and practice delivering the following instruction to students using the formal communication register: “Books open to page 11.”  (Allow students to practice for at least two rounds each.)  T: How did it feel to deliver a simple instruction using the formal communication register?  What went well?  What was difficult?  S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Practice 1: Analyze Formal Register in Action   T: (Show the video, “Formal Register:  Teach Like a Champion Team”.) How does the teacher use a strong voice in the video?  S: Answers will vary. (Record answers in 2.5 student guide.)  T: What was similar to your own practice rounds? What was different?  S: Answers will vary. (Record answers in 2.5 student guide.), | Student Guide  Video: “Formal Register:  Teach Like a Champion Team” |
| 2 mins | Intro to Practice Rounds T: You will practice the formal communication register in pairs.   Each round will focus on a specific element of the technique and increase in complexity.  You will stand and face your partner as you practice. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice 2: Formal Communication Register Practice Rounds  T: Directions for each round are in your student guide. For Round 1, focus on speaking quietly and slowly: “Books open to page 11.”  S: (Practice with partners.)  T: (Show students Round 1 Video: “Establish Formal Register: Colleen Driggs”). How was Colleen’s approach similar to or different from your own first round?   S: Answers will vary.   T: Practice another time and focus on speaking quietly and slowly: “Books open to page 11.”  S: (Practice with partners.)  T: Now, for round 2, in addition to speaking quietly and slowly, try speaking evenly and lower.  S: (Practice with partners.)  T: (Show students Round 2 Video: “Establish Formal Register: Colleen Driggs”). How was your own practice similar to or different from Colleen’s approach?   S: Answers will vary.   T: Practice again, speaking quietly, slowly, evenly, and lower.   S: (Practice with partners.)  T: Now use Formal Register body language into your directions. Give directions just as you did in the prior round, but this time, adopt a symmetrical posture, raise your chin, and hold still. S: (Practice with partners.)  T: (Show students Round 3 Video: “Establish Formal Register: Colleen Driggs”.) How was your third round similar to or different from Colleen’s approach?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Practice again, speaking quietly, slowly, evenly, and lower, while adopting a symmetrical posture, raising your chin, and holding still, just as Colleen did.  S: (Practice with partners).  Round 4 – Warm Formal  T: Try going “warm formal.”  In other words, go formal, but relax your brow and give just a hint of a smile as you speak.  S: (Practice warm formal.)  T: How does might a warm formal tone impact student response?   S: Students are more likely to respond to a warm tone than a cold or sharp or mean tone. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice 3: Delivering Longer Directions  T: (Divide students into groups. Allow each student to practice standing and delivering a longer set of directions to their peers in a f role play scenario.)   T: You will have five minutes to complete number one of your “You Do.”  You are working silently and solo and using your notes.  Five minutes begins now. | Student Guide |
|  | Debrief T:  Now that you have completed your practice rounds, how comfortable are you implementing Formal Communication Registry? And why?   S: Answers will vary.   T: What would be the impact of Formal Communication Registry have on student productivity in the classroom?  S: Students are more likely to respond quickly to formal communication especially if it is given in a warm tone. |  |
