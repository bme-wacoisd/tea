### Lesson 2.24: Private Individual Correction | Application

Bellringer:
Consider the following scenario and write a script for a Private Individual Correction that adheres to the five keys for effective implementation (Maintain Privacy, Describe the Solution, Use a Warm or Neutral Tone, Bookend with Simple Tasks, and Keep it Brief):
Scenario: It’s near the end of class, and students have been engaged in independent work for some time. One student, Chelsea, has not finished, but she is She appears to be doodling or drawing a picture on a separate sheet of paper. Practice giving her a Private Individual Correction.





Intro to Planning Private Individual Corrections
When you practice delivery, you probably won't use the exact same words you've planned, and that's okay.  The act of planning with intentionality gives you the opportunity to practice the thought process you should engage in each time you deliver a Private Individual Correction.

In planning your Private Individual Correction, be sure to:
Describe the solution:  Describe what you’d like your student to do to meet your expectations
Bookend with simple tasks:  Start and end your interaction with a pair of observable directions (i.e., an "in-task" and an "out-task")
Keep it brief

Revisit and revise your scripted Private Individual Correction as necessary.


Practice 1: Delivering Private Individual Correction
You will now practice delivering your scripted Private Individual Corrections in iterative rounds with each round focusing on a very specific element of the technique and with increased complexity as the rounds progress.









| Keys for Effective Private Individual Correction |
| --- |
| Maintain Privacy:  Here are a few ways you can maintain the privacy of your correction: Give the class a task to complete so that you're intervening at a time when it's easy to be "off-stage" Circulate for a moment instead of making a beeline to the student so that other students have a moment to get started Crouch down to the student's eye level Speak quietly |
| Describe the Solution:  Describe what you’d like your student to do (as opposed to what not to do) in order to meet your expectations (e.g., “During class discussion, it's important that you give your peers your full attention: eyes and ears on them.”).  This lets students know what they did wrong while also ensuring they learn from it. |
| Use a Warm or Neutral Tone:  It can be challenging to maintain emotional constancy when delivering a Private Individual Correction, especially if you've already redirected the student several other times in different ways.  But communicating your frustration through your tone will only undermine your efforts to get your student back on track.  Therefore, be sure to use a warm or neutral tone of voice when you speak. |
| Bookend with Simple Tasks:  Start and end your interaction with a pair of observable directions.  Start with an “in-task” that students can complete to show they’re ready (e.g., “Pause your writing” or, "Eyes on me, please.") Close with an “out-task” that tells students what they can do to get back on track right away (e.g., “Pick up your pencil and begin right away. Thank you.” or “Start with question 1. Thank you.”) |
| Keep it Brief:  Keep the correction short so that the student can get back to the learning as quickly as possible. |


| Round | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Round 1 | Deliver your scripted Private Individual Corrections with a partner (without reading the script) while still describing the solution, bookending with simple tasks, and keeping it brief. |
| Round 2 | Deliver your scripted Private Individual Corrections with a partner (without reading the script) while describing the solution, bookending with simple tasks, keeping it brief, and using a warm or neutral tone. |
| Round 3 | Deliver your scripted Private Individual Corrections with a partner (without reading the script) while describing the solution, bookending with simple tasks, keeping it brief, using a warm or neutral tone, and maintaining privacy. |
| Round 4 | Apply everything you’ve learned, along with Doug's advice.  That is, you should: Describe the solution, bookend with simple tasks, and keep it brief Use a warm or neutral tone Maintain privacy through circulating, crouching down, and speaking quietly Emphasize purpose, not power, through using body language, tone of voice, and choice of words that communicate, "I'm doing this because I care about you" |
