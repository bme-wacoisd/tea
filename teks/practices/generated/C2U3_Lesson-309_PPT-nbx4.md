### Communication Role Play

- Read the scenario below and complete the table to plan for the parent meeting. Be prepared to role play this meeting with a partner.
- Frankie works hard during Math class but could use a little extra support with understanding fractions. You decide to contact his parents to let them know that the school offers after school tutoring sessions twice a week and that Frankie may benefit from this additional practice. English is not the primary language spoken at home, and Frankie recently mentioned that he does not have consistent internet access at home.
- Role Play | Pairs will assume the role of teacher and parent. Each student will have 3 minutes to serve as the teacher, and then switch.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alejandro | 10/1 | Call | To shout-out Alejandro for his recent reading test score—he is now reading above grade level. | Alejandro’s dad was excited, mentioned that they had been reading together more at home recently | Email Alejandro’s dad book recommendations so that he can continue to read with Alejandro at home. |

### Family Communication Tracking Log

- Scenario #1:
- Stephanie has historically been a good student, but recently has had issues staying awake in class.  Knowing that her mom prefers to communicate by email, you send her a message explaining the situation.
- Her mom responded the next day and shared that their family recently welcomed a new baby sister, which has thrown off Stephanie’s bedtime routine. She commits to ensuring Stephanie goes to bed at a consistent time. You respond thanking her for the context and share that you can also provide Stephanie with opportunities to get a drink of water or to walk around to help her stay awake.
