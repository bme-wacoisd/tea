| Rationale/ Summary | Effective teachers use worked examples to reduce student cognitive load, enabling learners to focus on understanding the process which leads to an answer, not the answer itself. Worked examples are a type of modeling that are particularly effective when students are solving a problem and have little prior knowledge of the content. They include a focus on the process of solving a problem by providing steps to solving the problem and rationale for steps. The worked examples increase in complexity to move students from mimicking the process to deeper, conceptual understanding. | Effective teachers use worked examples to reduce student cognitive load, enabling learners to focus on understanding the process which leads to an answer, not the answer itself.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | What is a worked example? How is it the same or different from the strategy of modeling? Look at the scenario provided below for a worked example. Does this worked example meet the criteria to be effective? Provide evidence for your decision based on the chart of criteria below.  An English teacher asks her class to write a short essay that recounts the three most important events that happened during the weekend. She modeled the process with a worked example of the steps shown below: Write a list of all the activities you did during the weekend. Rank the activities from most important to least important. Identify two fun facts about each of the top three activities. Use these fun facts to craft short sentences about the activities that can be combined to create the essay.  The teacher began by modeling the process by sharing her planning notes and sample essay, which the class reviewed together. She annotated the steps on her notes and essay as she reviewed it with the class. The class was then asked to follow the steps to craft their sentences for their essay. Prior to writing the full essay, the students shared their work with a partner to get feedback. They then wrote the brief essay.  See Answer Key Exit Ticket for exemplar response. | What is a worked example? How is it the same or different from the strategy of modeling? Look at the scenario provided below for a worked example.

| 5 mins | Bellringer Describe each of the key practices in an effective model and explain why they help learning. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Introduction to Worked Examples  T: Please locate the Introduction to Worked Examples on your student guide.  S: (Locate Introduction to Worked Examples in Student Guide.)  T: In previous lessons, we have discussed, and you have practiced, the strategy of modeling. The high leverage practice that we will focus on today is using worked examples.  T: Worked examples are a specific type of modeling. They are a step-by-step demonstration of how to complete a task or solve a problem. Worked examples focus on the process and why the steps are important in solving the problem. Generally, they include a series of examples that increase in complexity. Based on this definition, where might you have experienced worked examples in the past?  S: In math class?   T: Yes, math class is a great example of where you might find worked examples, but they can be useful anywhere you need to teach a new process to learners. Worked examples are helpful when students have little to no prior knowledge of the skill to be learned. By first demonstrating the process step-by-step to students, they can learn what they need to do and what success looks like.   T: Another benefit of using worked examples is that when students are shown the strategy in this way, they can focus on the process rather than the answer. This allows the brain to utilize all the power of the working memory to applying information, thus reducing the cognitive load.  T: Let’s look at some criteria for worked examples.   Focuses on the process: Removing the need to find a solution reduces cognitive load for students, especially when the information is new. Provides steps and Rationale: Shows expert thinking and highlights key important details. The rationale is important to highlight so students know not just what to do by why it is important to the process. Increases in complexity: Examples move from basic to more challenging. This helps the learner to transition from using the example as a reference to mimic to thinking more deeply and understanding the process. It is important that all problems are appropriately challenging; challenging enough to push the students but not too much that they become frustrated with the process. | PPT Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Example: Worked Examples  T: Let’s look at an example of an effective worked example.  Locate the Example: Worked Examples section in your Student Guide.  S: (Locate Example: Worked Examples section.)  T: (Display the worked example on the PowerPoint.)  Take a moment to review the example provided. (Provide 1 minute for review.)  S: (Review example.)  T: We said that effective worked examples have three criteria:  They focus on the process more than the solution, they provide the steps and rationale, and they increase in complexity. Where do you see the steps provided with a rationale?  S: Mr. Brooks first shows an example that he models. He explains what the students need to do in each step.  T:  How does this series of examples focus on the process rather than the solutions?  S: The problems use language that have students focusing on the process. Each example looks at the process, rather than emphasizing the solution.  T: Where do you see the increasing complexity throughout this worked example?  S: Mr. Brooks modeled the whole process first, then provided a completely solved example, then asked the students to complete the process, removing some steps before they were asked to complete a problem independently.  T: Yes, Mr. Brooks slowly removed the scaffolds for students. He also utilized a strategy of “I do,” “We do” and “You do” for gradual release of the scaffolds for students. |  |
| 5 mins | Non-Example: Worked Examples  T: Let’s look at a non-example.  Locate the Non-Example: Worked Examples section in your Student Guide.  S: (Locate Non-Example: Worked Examples section.)  T: Take a moment to review the example provided. (Provide 1 minute for review.)  S: (Review example.)  T: Based on what we know about effective worked examples, how does this example not meet the criteria for providing steps and rationale?  S: The steps for solution are provided but there is no explanation of why the steps are important or how they help to solve the problem.  T: Right. Mr. Jones doesn’t explain why it is important to multiply by 1000 to convert from kilograms to grams.  Students will not understand the importance of that step or why the number 1000 was used. What about the focus on process? How does this not focus on process rather than the solution?  S: In the practice the students do, the problems are about finding the solution. There is nothing that mentions showing work or the process.  T: Exactly. It appears that the only number desired is the solution in the practice problems given. How does this non-example not meet the criteria for increasing complexity?  S: Mr. Jones does a problem and then releases the students to work independently. He asks them to convert kg to g and g to kg. He doesn’t show them how to calculate g to kg.    T:  Yes. In this case, complexity was increased too fast. Mr. Jones does not show students how to convert from g to kg and because he doesn’t explain his steps, they likely won’t know what to do.  That can lead to more student errors and frustration. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice: Worked Examples  T: Now you will practice identifying the criteria for effective worked examples on your own. Locate the practice section on your student guide.   S: (Locate practice section.)  T:  You have been provided two scenarios involving worked examples in a classroom. In a group of three, you will review each scenario and determine to what extent the scenario demonstrates the criteria for a worked example. You can record your thinking and rationale in the chart below each example. (Group students into teams of 3.)  T:  You will have 10 minutes to complete the two examples. You can begin working now. (Set timer for 10 minutes.)  S: (Work in groups of three to complete practice activity.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Did practice example 1 meet the criteria of an effective worked example? Why or why not?  S: Yes, the teacher demonstrated the process for finding prime factors.  The steps were highlighted, and students were asked to replicate the process in the independent practice. Each step was clear, and a rationale was provided. The teacher demonstrated the first factor tree, then the students worked as a class, then students were asked to do it independently with larger numbers.  T: What about practice example 2? Did it meet the criteria for an effective worked example?  S: No, While the teacher provided some steps, in subsequent steps they did not emphasize the steps to classify. Also, the practice doesn’t ask students to justify using the process. The teacher provided steps but didn’t provide a rationale in the 2nd and 3rd examples. The teacher modeled the first classification and then went on to classify two more shapes. There is no increasing difficulty with the examples provided and students do not have to justify thinking.   T:  So, based on what you have learned today, how do modeling, and worked examples differ?  S: Worked examples are a special kind of modeling. They include step-by-step demonstrations for students like modeling, but the focus is on the process for solving a problem. They include a sequence of examples that increase in complexity and focus on the rationale for each step. |  |
