Bellringer
Read the following scenario.
Mr. Elliott plans to introduce the concept of rectangles to his class. He wants to provide examples and nonexamples of a rectangle based on the following definition: A rectangle is a four-sided polygon with four right angles.
Help Mr. Elliott by creating two examples and two nonexamples of a rectangle. Then, write a short statement Mr. Elliott might use to explain the connections and distinctions between the different examples and nonexamples.


TLAC “Stretch It” Technique
As you watch the video clip, respond to the following questions:
- How does Michael respond to his students correct answers?


- What message does this send to the class?



Key Vocabulary
Define each key term below.

Two Ways to Stretch It: Directive Prompts

Notes on Directive Prompts:




Video Example:
As you watch the Arielle Hoo video, record examples of how the teacher uses Stretch It questions to both reveal information about student thinking and build a culture of rigor.





#### Practice #1

Examine the following sample student-teacher interactions:
Interaction #1:
Teacher: Use the word "reassured" in a sentence.
Student: My mother reassured me that we were safe inside the house during the storm.
Interaction #2:
Teacher: What are the three branches of the federal government?
Student: The three branches of the federal government are executive, judicial, and legislative.

Script two directive prompts you might give for each interaction.


Practice #2: Role Play
Read your scenario card and write out a set of Stretch It-Directive Prompts. Use the guidelines we reviewed earlier to help you develop prompts. After you complete your prompts, you will have time to do a role play in your groups. Non-role-playing students should identify which stretch it techniques were employed and record them below.
Scenario 1:
Teacher: Which war was fought between the north and south regions in the United States?
Student: The Civil War
Teacher: Stretch It question
