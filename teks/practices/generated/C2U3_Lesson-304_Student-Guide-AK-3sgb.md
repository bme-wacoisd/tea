Bellringer: Read the scenario below.

Henry is a student in Ms. Guajardo’s 5th grade class. Ms. Guajardo has noticed that Henry’s grades are falling, and he has been sleeping in class. She decides to check in with him to learn more about what’s going on. She knows that Henry enjoys reading and invites him to help organize the new books she received for the classroom library during lunch.

During this time, she tells him she is concerned about his recent grades and sleeping in class and asks him what’s going on. Henry tells her his parents are getting a divorce and he’s having trouble concentrating. Ms. Guajardo asks how long he has known of this change in his family. She tells him that lots of kids’ parents get divorced and he shouldn’t let it worry him or impact his grades. Henry begins to explain that he’s trying not to worry but that he’s not sure which parent he will be living with. As he talks, Ms. Guajardo’s phone rings. She tells him she needs to answer but she will check in with him again later.


Underline strategies Ms. Guajardo uses to learn more about and build trust with her student Henry. Strike through things Ms. Guajardo should not do.


- What else might Ms. Guajardo do to continue to understand Henry, build trust and rapport, and help him academically in the classroom?
She could call his family to ask how he is doing. She could be empathetic. She could share an experience she has had with a change in the family. She could begin the conversation with something non-academic and focus on similar interests.


#### Practice 1: Planning the Conversation


Scenario 1
Raul is a 5th grader. He is generally a focused and diligent student, but in the last couple of days, you have noticed that he has been very distracted during class. He is having a hard time sitting still and staying focused on his work, and he has been asking to get water or go to the bathroom in the middle of lessons every day. He has also failed to turn in homework for a couple of days in a row. You ask him to stay behind after class one day to ask him what’s going on. You find out that he is trying out for the basketball team and has been attending practice clinics at night. He is nervous about making the team and worried that if he doesn’t make the team, he’ll let his parents down. How can you use trust generators to respond to Raul?

Scenario 2
Angelina is a 3rd grader. One day you notice a change in her behavior after lunch. In the morning, she had been happy and engaged in the lesson. She contributed to class discussion, completed her work, and helped her peers. After lunch, it looks like she may have been crying. She sits at her desk and puts her head down and refuses to do any work. When a friend tries to ask her what’s wrong, she yells out, “Just leave me alone!” You pull her aside for a private conversation and find out that during lunch she got in a fight with her best friend. How do you help Angelina get back on track and build rapport with her?
