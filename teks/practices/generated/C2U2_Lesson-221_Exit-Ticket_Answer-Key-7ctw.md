### Lesson 2.21: Nonverbal Interventions | Practice

Name:
Date:
- Review your response to the bellringer scenario. What would you change – if anything – from what you wrote at the beginning of the lesson?
Scenario: When one student in a classroom is responding to a teacher’s question during a class discussion, another student begins to get up from their desk seat to use the pencil sharpener.

Answers will vary but should show an understanding of nonverbal interventions. For example, the student may indicate that they would make eye contact, smile benignly at the student who is out of their seat and motion for them to get back to their seat by moving their head in the direction of the student’s desk.

- Given what you have learned in this lesson, what would you do in this scenario:
While a student is presenting his or her work to the class, another student begins to interrupt with a question for the teacher.
Answers will vary but should show an understanding of nonverbal interventions. For example, the student may indicate that s/he would hold up a hand indicating “stop” to the student interrupting while maintaining focus on the student presenting. The “stop” hand signal might change to a single index finger indicating “one minute.” Then, when the student presenting had finished speaking, the teacher would shift focus to the student who had interrupted to see what was needed.
