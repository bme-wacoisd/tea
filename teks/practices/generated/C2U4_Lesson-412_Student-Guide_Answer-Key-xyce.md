What are Directive Prompts?
Question prompts to guide students to think further in a specific way.
Based on what you learned in the previous lesson, what are two types of Directive Prompts you might use after a student responds correctly?
- Ask How or Why
- Ask for Another Way to Reach the Same Answer
- Ask for More Precise Expression
- Ask for Evidence
- Ask for Integration of a Related Skill
- Ask for Application of the Same Skill in a New Setting
How do Directive Prompts lead to cognitive engagement?
It forces students to think critically and elaborate on their thinking as opposed to providing a one-word response. It pushes students to make connections and draw on their prior knowledge and learning.


Two Ways to Stretch It: Non-Directive Prompts
#### Key Vocabulary

Define each key term below.

Go-to examples:
“Say more”
“Keep going”
“Develop that”
Notes on Non-Directive Prompts:


Video Example:
As you watch the MK Pope video clip, record examples of how the teacher uses Stretch It questions to both reveal information about student thinking and build a culture of rigor.
She responds with the following prompts:
What is the monster? (Directive)
Somebody build on it, please. (Nondirective)
Say more. (Nondirective)
How do we know this connects with that idea? (Directive)
By asking these questions, MK Pope was able to gauge students understanding of the connection between a passage they just read and their previous learning on institutional racism in the United States. By asking Stretch It questions, students had to elaborate to demonstrate their understanding and further develop their ideas.


#### Practice #1

Examine the following sample student-teacher interactions:
Interaction #1:
Teacher: Use the word "reassured" in a sentence.
Student: My mother reassured me that we were safe inside the house during the storm.
Interaction #2:
Teacher: What are the three branches of the federal government?
Student: The three branches of the federal government are executive, judicial, and legislative.


Script two Non-Directive prompts you might give for each interaction.
