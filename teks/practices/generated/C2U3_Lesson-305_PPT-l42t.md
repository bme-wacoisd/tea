## Slide 3

### Bellringer: Scenario 1

- For each scenario, consider two possible ways that a teacher could respond. Place a check mark next to the best response and explain your choice underneath the scenario.
- Scenario 1:
- A new student has enrolled in Ms. B’s fifth grade class. She noticed that he was speaking Spanish with his parents when they dropped him off at school this morning, and he isn’t speaking to many of his new classmates.
- Option A: Ms. B administers a reading assessment to determine the new student’s reading level. He can read above his grade level, so she makes sure that he has challenging books for silent reading.
- Option B: Since Ms. B is pretty sure that her new student doesn’t speak English well, she skips the reading assessment. She gives him a third-grade book for silent reading.

## Slide 4

### Bellringer: Scenario 2

- Scenario 2:
- Mr. W teaches high school science. The TEKS for his course state that students should complete lab experiments. Mr. W knows that his students haven’t had much experience in science labs because the district doesn’t have a lot of science equipment.
- Option A: Mr. W thinks it will be easier for his students to watch videos of the lab experiments rather than complete them on their own.
- Option B: Mr. W spends time understanding what his students know about working in the lab and provides instruction on basic lab skills before introducing his students to the experiments.
