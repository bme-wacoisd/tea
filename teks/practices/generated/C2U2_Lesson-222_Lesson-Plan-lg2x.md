| Rationale/ Summary | To maximize student learning, students need to be able to hear the teacher’s instruction.  The Strong Voice principle, Do Not Talk Over, allows teachers to maximize their impact on student attention in the classroom.  If what is being said is worthy of attention, ensure every listener can hear it. | To maximize student learning, students need to be able to hear the teacher’s instruction.  The Strong Voice principle, Do Not Talk Over, allows teachers to maximize their impact on student attention in the classroom.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Ms. K is a fourth-grade math teacher. She is explaining how to do a problem and is talking loudly over side conversations, the grinding of the pencil sharpener, and the rustling of papers. What is the likely impact on learning in the classroom? What is the likely impact on the classroom culture? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Do Not Talk Over T: Strong Voice is a technique for adjusting your speech and body language to ensure students listen carefully to what you say.  To maximize student learning, students need to hear your instruction.  When you need students' full attention, wait to speak until there is no other talking or classroom disruption.  T: What should a teacher do if they've already started talking and other chatter or noises prove distracting?  S: Stop talking and correct the behavior. Wait until students are listening again.  T: Yes, this is called self-interrupt. Self-interrupt is a Strong Voice strategy for classroom management that is the quickest way to remind students that the content of your class is important. (Model the technique by self-interrupting while delivering a statement such as: “Yesterday, we discussed the process of photosynthesis.” Call on several students to model self-interruption while delivering a similar statement.)  T: (Review the success criteria for this strategy using the PPT and model each criteria.)  Adopt a symmetrical stance and hold still.   Hold the pause in your speech for one or two seconds to signal that what you’re about to say is of the utmost importance.   To enhance the strategy, raise your eyebrows.   Finally, when you do begin speaking again, speak quieter, slower, evenly, and at a slightly lower pitch.  S: (Copy teacher moves.)  T: Now, let’s see what this looks like in a classroom. Find the viewing guide in your student guide and respond to the question after watching the video.  T: (Show the video of TLAC Team Member Erica Woolway sharing her analysis of instruction in Laura Fern's first-grade classroom.)  S: (Respond to viewing guide question in the student guide.) | Student Guide PowerPoint Video: Do Not Talk Over: Laura Fern |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Applying Self-Interrupt  T: (Assemble students into pairs)  T: Now, you will practice in pairs through a series of rounds that will each focus on a specific element of the technique. Stand up in front of your partner as you practice, like you would when teaching and use the chart in the 2.22 Student Guide to record your thoughts and to provide feedback to each other.   S: (Move into pairs and stand across from one another.) T: Let’s start with a basic self-interrupt. As you say to students, “Yesterday, we discussed the process of evaporation,” you realize that a few students have become chatty. Practice self-interrupting on the word “evaporation” to regain their attention. (Provide time for students to practice.)  T: (Show students the video of Teach Like a Champion team member, Doug Lemov, trying self-interruption on the word “evaporation.”)  T: How did Doug’s approach compare to your own first round?  S: Answers will vary.   T: Try it again now that you have seen it in action.  S:(Student pairs practice again, just focusing on self-interrupting on the word “evaporation.”)  T: In Round 2, we’ll practice on interrupting mid-word. Let’s watch Doug Lemov do it first.  T: (Show students the video of Teach Like a Champion team member, Doug Lemov, self-interrupting on the word “evaporation.”)  T: How was this different than the first round?   S: He paused in the middle of the word instead of at the end.   T: What is the impact of pausing in the middle of the word?   S: Students are more likely to notice the interruption. Pausing mid-word shows the teacher has been interrupted by student behavior.  T: Now you try. Practice self-interrupting mid-word when saying “evaporation.”  S: (Practice with their partners and provide feedback.) T: Now, let’s talk about posture. Let’s watch Doug’s posture during this video clip. (Show the video of Doug Lemov self-interrupting mid-word when saying “evaporation” using a still, symmetrical posture.)  T: How does posture impact the self-interruption?   S: It shows that the teacher is serious and students should pay attention.   T: Now it’s your turn to practice with the same sentence and the same pattern of self-interruption, but now focus on adopting a still, symmetrical posture.  S: (Practice with their partners and provide feedback.)  T: OK, time for the last round. This time, you’ll use a quieter, slower, even, & lower voice like Doug.  T:(Show the video of Doug Lemov trying to self-interrupt mid-word when saying “evaporation” using a still, symmetrical posture and speaking quieter, slower, even, and lower.)  T: How does tone of voice impact the self-interrupt?   S: It makes it more serious. Students are more likely to pay attention. | Student Guide  Video: Do Not Talk Over: Doug Lemov (Round 1)  Video: Do Not Talk Over: Doug Lemov (Round 2)  Video: Do Not Talk Over: Doug Lemov (Round 3)  Video: Do Not Talk Over: Doug Lemov (Round 4) |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Delivering Longer Directions  T: Let’s try now with longer instructions in a role play scenario. The class will be divided into three large groups. Let’s move to our groups now. (Move students into groups)  T: In your groups, each group member will take a turn delivering the instructions that you practiced in the previous scenario. This time you will deliver these as long instructions, meaning you will not break up the techniques we practiced into rounds as we did in our small groups. Your peers will provide opportunities for you to self-interrupt.  T: Peers, it is important to remember that the student who is acting as the “teacher” in the scenario needs an opportunity to self-interrupt, but please be respectful. You should engage in minor behavior infractions such as talking over or getting out of their seat as the “teacher” practices, but please be mindful of our classroom rules and expectations.  T: In your Student Guide, you will find a notes section where you can take notes of feedback you receive as well as self-reflection after you have completed your role play.   S: (Practice role playing until each student has had the chance to be the “teacher.” Provide feedback to one another using the Do Not Talk Over success criteria.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let’s return to the question posed at the beginning of the lesson: why would it be ineffective for a teacher to simply talk over side conversations, the grinding of the pencil sharpener, or the rustling of papers?   S: (Add thoughts based on the student practice rounds.) |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
