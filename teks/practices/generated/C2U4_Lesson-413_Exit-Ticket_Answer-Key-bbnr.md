## Exit Ticket - Answer Key

### Lesson 4.13:  Practice with Feedback | Deliberate Practice

Name:
Date:
A kindergarten teacher has created the following lesson goal and planned practice in her math lesson on the topic of attributes of two related objects.  Examine the lesson goal and the corresponding practice.  Does this practice activity reflect the characteristics of deliberate practice?  Explain why or why not.
Instructional Goal:  Students will analyze to find two objects that are the exactly the same or not exactly the same.
Planned practice:  Students will be shown pairs of socks in a variety of patterns, colors, sizes, and lengths in a laundry bag.  The teacher will hold up two socks and students will utilize the sentence stems “these are exactly the same because….” Or “these are NOT exactly the same because…”.  The class will work together to identify if the socks are exactly the same or not exactly the same with teacher feedback.  Then students will be given a group of pictures that they will sort individually into piles of “exactly the same” or “not exactly the same”.  After they are finished sorting, they will share their thinking with a partner.


Why is deliberate practice important to the learning process?
Deliberate practice that is authentic, spaced over time, low-stakes and paired with feedback is important to the learning process because it engages the working memory and moves ideas and content to the long-term memory.  When practice is spaced over time, it requires the learner to continue to access knowledge from long term memory to better refine & deepen understanding.

| Characteristics of Deliberate Practice | Is there Evidence of this Characteristic? | Provide the evidence.  If no evidence is present, describe how the teacher might adjust the practice to address the characteristic. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authentic | Yes | The practice is authentic, as the students are sorting the pictures into groups of “exactly the same” and “not exactly the same” |
| Spaced Over Time | No | The teacher could make sure to revisit these classifications with a bell ringer or practice the next day. |
| Low stakes | Yes | The practice is low stakes because the task is modeled as a guided activity first and then students are asked to do it independently not for a grade |
| Practice with timely feedback | Yes | This practice also includes feedback as the students are asked to share their thinking with a partner |
