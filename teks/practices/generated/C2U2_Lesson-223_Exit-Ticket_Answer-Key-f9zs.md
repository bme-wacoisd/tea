Name:
Date:
- How is Private Individual Correction a minimally invasive redirection strategy?
Because redirections are nearly invisible, which do not draw attention to the student or the behavior and allow teaching and learning to continue.

- How can the Private Individual Correction strategy contribute to the development of positive relationships with students and foster a positive classroom culture?
The Positive Individual Correction strategy promotes trust with the teacher and the student, as the student is less likely to feel embarrassed or “called out” by the teacher. Additionally, students are given a low stakes opportunity to correct their behavior and others around them are less likely to notice.

- How can the Private Individual Correction strategy ensure that students meet expectations?
Expectations are clearly defined and the student knows what behavior to correct, however they do not feel defensive with how the correction was presented and therefore more likely to make the correction.
