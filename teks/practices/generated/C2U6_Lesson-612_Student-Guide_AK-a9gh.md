| Lesson | Pages Numbers to Prepare to Teach |
| --- | --- |
| English Language Arts Practice Lesson: Norse Mythology, the “K”-sound, and homophones Third grade | Amplify Texas Elementary Literacy | Unit 6  | Lesson 1 (page 12) | The lessons you will teach starts on page 12 and runs to page 15. Additionally, you should read the advance preparation on page 10 (excluding the last bullet). Note that on page 14 the lesson refers to the name Loki. As part of this unit, students are reading a book titled Gods, Giants, and Dwarves. The individual code chart refers to the top line of the chart at the bottom of page 14.  and provides students all five of the different spellings for /k/. |
| Math Practice Lesson: Explore the relationship between human capital and income. Third grade | Eureka Math TEKS Edition | Module 6 | Lesson 1 (page 12) | The lesson you will teach starts on page 12 in the section titled “Concept Development” and ends on page 14 with the Problem Set. We will not teach the Fluency Practice section for this lesson. The objective can be found on page 11. Your students will need a document called the Problem Set where they record their responses to different questions, read a table in a section of the lesson, and practice. |
| Science: Observe and compare the life cycle stages of organisms. Third grade | PhD Science TEKS Edition | Module 2 | Lesson 17 (page 184) | The lesson you will teach starts on page 184 and runs through page 187 (intro to Butterfly Life Cycle and beginning part of sequencing organism cards). You will need the Science Lesson Resource document which includes a butterfly picture for the beginning of your lesson and a card sort for your students to arrange life cycles. Note that your lesson includes a 2-minute video. You should have access to a computer during your sample lesson to access and play the video. |


| What is the objective of your lesson? |  |
| --- | --- |
| Describe the direct instruction in the lesson. |  |
| Describe the student practice in your lesson. |  |
| What do you think students will have the most difficulty within the lesson? |  |
| Where in your lesson will you formatively assess student understanding? |  |
| What materials do you need to teach this lesson? |  |
| Identify any outstanding questions you have about teaching your lesson. |  |
| After reading the entire lesson, describe in your own words the most important content for students to attend to in this lesson? |  |


| What is the objective of your lesson? | Students will categorize words using different spelling patterns for /k/. Students will identify homophones. |
| --- | --- |
| Describe the direct instruction in the lesson | The teacher writes the word list on the board. Then asks the students to circle for the /k/ sound verbally.  The teacher introduces the idea of a homophone using the words course and coarse.  The teacher solicits homophones from the students. Students categorize the words as a class into the code chart that is displayed on the board. |
| Describe the student practice in your lesson. | Students categorize the words as a class into the code chart. Students identify examples of homophones. |
| Where in your lesson will you formatively assess student understanding? | The teacher will informally formatively assess the students when they categorize each word by the 5 types of spellings for the /k/ sound. |
| What materials do you need to teach this lesson? | Lesson Plan. White board. Chart for spellings for /k/ sounds. |
| Identify any outstanding questions you have about teaching your lesson. | Answers will vary. |
| After reading the entire lesson, describe in your own words the most important content for students to attend to in this lesson? | Students will categorize words using different spelling patterns for /k/. Students will identify homophones. |


| What is the objective of your lesson? | Explore the relationship between human capital and income. |
| --- | --- |
| Describe the direct instruction in the lesson | Problem 1 poses the question: What are some jobs you know about? What job do you think you might want to do one day? The teacher asks, has students talk a partner, and then records why someone might choose a certain job. Teacher then describes degrees and certificates that people earn to be able to get certain jobs. Teacher has students analyze Ben’s data set. |
| Describe the student practice in your lesson. | Students complete the problem set. |
| Where in your lesson will you formatively assess student understanding? | The teacher uses questioning and partner conversations throughout the lesson to gauge student understanding of the relationship between human capital and income.  The problem set includes formative assessments that will give information on how well students can explain the relationship between human capital and income. |
| What materials do you need to teach this lesson? | Lesson Plan Problem Set worksheet. |
| Identify any outstanding questions you have about teaching your lesson. | Answers will vary |
| After reading the entire lesson, describe in your own words the most important content for students to attend to in this lesson? | They want students to understand that not all jobs pay the same – in fact, they can pay quite different salaries. I think it is important that students understand the connection between education and the ability to get jobs and how those jobs potentially pay. |


| What is the objective of your lesson? | Observe and compare the life cycle stages of different organisms. |
| --- | --- |
| Describe the direct instruction in the lesson | Display a photo of a butterfly in the snow. Ask: How does this picture challenge what you think about butterflies and migration? Distribute a set of butterfly life cycle cards and ask students to arrange the cards to show the butterfly life cycle. Invite pairs to share their sequence with the class. Play the “Egg to Butterfly: The Life of a Monarch” (Belchamber 2018) video. Have students sequence other organism life cycle cards. |
| Describe the student practice in your lesson. | Students practice organizing the butterfly life cycle cards. Students sequence other organism life cycle cards. |
| Where in your lesson will you formatively assess student understanding? | Question: How does this picture challenge what you think about butterflies and migration? Card sorts will offer an opportunity assess student understanding of life cycles. |
| What materials do you need to teach this lesson? | Lesson Plan. Butterfly Picture. Cards Sorts (butterfly and other animals) |
| Identify any outstanding questions you have about teaching your lesson. | Answers will vary |
| After reading the entire lesson, describe in your own words the most important content for students to attend to in this lesson? | That organisms have stages in their life cycle when they come into being, grow, and reproduce and that the life cycle keeps regenerating organisms over time. That life cycle looks different for different organisms. |
