## Student Guide – Answer Key

### Lesson 4.10: Deepening Student Understanding with Examples and Nonexamples

Bellringer: Look at the following tasks to determine which task is more rigorous based on the guidelines for rigorous tasks listed below. Use the guidelines for rigorous tasks to support your answer.

Guidelines for Rigorous Tasks:
Build on and extend prior knowledge
Involve effortful thought
Deepen conceptual understanding of material
Require learners to communicate their understanding to others
Involve multiple interpretations or paths to a solution

Task 1: What is 1/3 of ½?
Task 2: Ms. Green makes a full pan of brownies to bring to school. She’s going to bring half of the pan to share with her students. She knows many of her students like icing, so she needs to figure out how much icing to make. If she ices one third of the part that she’s taking to school, how much of the whole pan would that be? Write an equation to represent this, and then use a fraction bar or number line to explain your answer.

Which task is more rigorous based on the guidelines rigorous tasks? Use evidence from the tasks to support your response.
Task 2 because students must build on and extend their prior knowledge of fractions and use effortful thinking by analyzing a scenario, drawing a visual representation, and creating an equation to explain their visual. Students communicate their understanding to others by explaining their answer with the class or partner. By allowing students to represent their thinking using either a fraction bar or number line, students have multiple paths to a solution. Lastly, task two requires a conceptual understanding of the material.


#### Instruction on Examples and Nonexamples

Criteria that can help deepen meaning and learning for students:
Include varied examples that will help students recognize the concept or idea in a variety of context.
Include contrasting non-examples that will help students develop an accurate mental picture of what a concept is and is not.
Prompt students to elaborate about the connections and differences among the examples and non-examples.

#### Key Vocabulary

Define each key term below.





#### Practice #1

In his first period math class, Mr. B has his students write the definition and some examples of integers.
In his second period class, he and his students complete a Frayer model to introduce the concept of integers.



Read and compare the two approaches:
First Period:
Integers: An integer is a number with no decimal or fractional part, from the set of negative and positive numbers, including zero.
Examples: -5, 0, -1, 5, 8, -97, and 3,043


Second Period:


Practice #1 Questions
What is similar between the First Period and Second Period activities?
Both require students to record the definitions and examples of integers.
What is different between the First Period and Second Period activities?
The Second Period activity also requires that students identify characteristics of integers and list nonexamples of integers.
How could the use of the Frayer model in the Second Period activity lead to a better understanding of the concept of integers?
The Frayer model requires that students think about what integers are and what they are not.
In Second Period, how could Mr. B prompt his students to make connections and identify differences between the examples and nonexamples?
Mr. B could ask questions about what the examples and nonexamples have in common (examples and nonexamples can both be positive or negative), and what the key differences are (integers do not have a fraction or decimal part).
Mr. B could also use the characteristics section of the organizer to help students understand how to identify an integer.



| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Examples | Something that shows what is expected or what something is |
| Nonexamples | Something that shows what is not expected or what something is not |


| Concept | Provide Examples | Provide Nonexamples | Connections and Differences among examples and nonexamples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solids | Apple Phone Ice block | Water Air Soda Helium | Connections: all are states of matter  Differences: solids |
| Simile | (Answers will vary)  A smile as bright as the sun.  Smell like a rose | (Answers will vary)  Laughter is the best medicine  Time is money | Connections: Examples of figurative language.  Differences: Similes make comparisons using “like” or “as” |
| Teacher Example (Optional) |  |  |  |
