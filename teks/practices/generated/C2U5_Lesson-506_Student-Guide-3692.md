### Lesson 5.06: Strategic Questioning Continued

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Respond to the following questions.
What are the characteristics of effective questions?


Why does the order and progression of questions matter for instruction based on the principles informed by the science of learning?


#### Practice 1: Question Evaluation – Part II


Review the lesson goal and teacher questions below. Evaluate the question set to determine to what extent it meets the criteria for increasing in complexity as the lesson progresses and for its ultimate alignment to the level of thinking required in the lesson goal.
Lesson Goal: Recognize the value of coins and count up to find their total value.
- What is this coin called?
- What is its value?
- And what is this coin and its value?
- And this one?
- Which one of these three coins is worth 10 cents?
- Which one is worth 1 cent?
- Which one of these coins would you rather have?
- How can you explain your reason for your selection?
- Why wouldn’t I have enough money to buy a piece of gum that cost 10 cents if I only had a nickel?

#### Practice 2: Lesson Analysis


Review the lesson goal and the pre-planned questions. For each question or set of questions, determine what information the teacher can learn and what their next steps might be.
Lesson goal: Analyze data to describe the relationship between characteristics and traits.



| Characteristic of Effective Questions | Met or Not Met? | Reasoning/Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Increases in complexity and demand as learning progresses |  |  |
| Aligned to the level of thinking required in the learning target |  |  |


| Activity | Planned Questions | Purpose of the Question (what the teacher can learn) | Teacher’s next steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bellringer: Students will look at a variety of tomatoes and compare them. | What is one characteristic of this tomato?  What is different about these two tomatoes?  How would you describe the similarities and differences between these two tomatoes? |  |  |
| Engage students in a discussion about their bellringer work. Create a chart to organize their thinking. | How could we organize our observations about the tomatoes? |  |  |
| Students take notes on the definitions of characteristic and trait. Use the chart to provide examples of the relationship between characteristics and traits. | We described the tomato as red. Which is this description – a characteristic or a trait?  Based on these traits, what is one characteristic of a tomato? How can we represent that information on our chart? |  |  |
| Students explore different species and record observations in a table that identifies characteristics and related traits for each species. | What is different about these individual species?   Which characteristic is related to those differences?  What is similar about these different species?   Which characteristic is related to those similarities? |  |  |
| Students synthesize their understanding through a class discussion about how the data in their charts helps them to explain the relationship between characteristics and traits. | How would you describe the relationship between characteristics and traits? Provide an example using tomatoes. How would you describe the relationship between characteristics and traits? Use evidence from your own species analysis charts. Why might it be important to understand how characteristics and traits are related to one another? |  |  |
