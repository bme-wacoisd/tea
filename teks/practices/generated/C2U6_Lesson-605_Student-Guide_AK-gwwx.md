### Lesson 6.05: Components of a High-Quality Objective

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Read each standard and determine which objective best aligns to the standard.
2.9G - read and write time to the nearest one-minute increment using analog and digital clocks and distinguish between a.m. and p.m.
Students will use digital and analog clocks to tell time.
Students will tell time to the nearest five minutes; relate a.m. and p.m. to time of day.
Students will solve word problems involving time to the nearest one-minute increment.
2.8A - create two-dimensional shapes based on given attributes, including number of sides and vertices
Students will build, identify, and analyze two-dimensional shapes with specified attributes.
Students will create two-dimensional shapes.
Students will identify two-dimensional shapes based on their attributes.
2.3A - partition objects into equal parts and name the parts, including halves, fourths, and eighths, using words
Students will partition shapes.
Students will partition circles and rectangles into equal parts, and describe those parts as halves, thirds, or fourths.
Students will name parts as halves, fourths or eighths using words.

Practice: Analysis of Objectives
Examine a list of objectives to determine if they are SMART and suggest revisions to any of the objectives that did not meet the criteria for a high-quality objective.




| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Standards | The learning goals or expectations for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level |
| Objectives | Brief statements that describe what students will be expected to learn by the end of the unit or lesson |
| Specific | Detailed and has a clear outcome |
| Measurable | Easily assessed or tracked to determine if the expectation has been met |
| Attainable | Reasonably challenging and can be achieved |
| Results-Focused | Aligned with the standard or expectations for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level |
| Time-Focused | Sets a time frame for when the goal should be achieved |


| Nonexample | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Students will partition shapes | Students will partition circles and rectangles into equal parts, and describe those parts as halves, fourths, and eighths. |
| Students will decode words | Students will read and spell one-syllable words with /a/ > ‘a’ and /i/ > ‘i’. |


| Criteria | Objective 1 | Objective 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specific | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective tells exactly what students will do and how they will apply that skill in the lesson. They will read and spell one-syllable word with /a/ and /i/. | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective is too broad and not detailed. |
| Measurable | Met Not Met  Reasoning: A teacher can give a check for understanding or some form of assessment to determine if students can achieve this goal. | Met Not Met  Reasoning: A teacher can give a check for understanding or some form of assessment to determine if students can achieve this goal, but the teacher isn’t going to know the types of words students need to decode. |
| Attainable | Met Not Met  Reasoning: It aligns to the grade-level standard and could be achieved in a single lesson. | Met Not Met  Reasoning: It would likely not be able to be attained in a single lesson. |
| Results-Focused | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective aligns to the standard. | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective is not detailed enough for us to know the types of words students are decoding. |
| Time-Focused | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective is meant to be achieved in this lesson since it is not specified otherwise. | Met Not Met  Reasoning: It would take longer than one or two lessons to meet this objective completely. |


| Objective | Standards | SMART | Suggestions for Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson 2: Students will complete close reads of several inventor biographies and will be able to summarize key ideas and key details and answer questions about the inventors, using text evidence to support their responses. | TEKS 4.6.G - Evaluate details read to determine key ideas.  TEKS 4.7.C - Use text evidence to support an appropriate response.  TEKS 4.7.D - Retell, paraphrase, or summarize texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective clearly addresses all the standards, is specific, measurable, and attainable. |  |
| I can write letters | TEKS K.2.E - Develop handwriting by accurately forming all uppercase and lowercase letters using appropriate directionality; | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective is not specific enough. | Students will correctly write the spelling ‘m’ to represent /m/. |
| Lessons 10–11: Use the addition of adjacent angle measures to solve problems using a letter for the unknown angle measure. | 4.7E - determine the measure of an unknown angle formed by two non-overlapping adjacent angles given one or both angle measures. | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective clearly addresses all the standards, is specific, measurable, and attainable. The objective also specifies that this lesson will be spread over two lessons. |  |
| Lesson 5: Sort and describe plants by their physical characteristics. | K.10A - sort plants and animals into groups based on physical characteristics such as color, size, body covering, or leaf shape | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective clearly addresses all the standards, is specific, measurable, and attainable. |  |
| Identify living and nonliving things | 1.9A – Sort and classify living and nonliving things based upon whether they have basic needs and produce offspring. | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective is not specific enough to meet the expectation of the standard. The objective is not results focused because it does not align to the rigor of the standard. | Students discuss, sort, and classify living organisms and non-living objects based on their properties. |
| Students will learn how to read, write, and tell time on analog clocks. | 2.9G – read and write time to the nearest one-minute increment using analog and digital clocks and distinguish between a.m. and p.m. | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The objective is not specific enough to meet the expectation of the standard. The objective just addresses analog clocks and does not address digital clocks | Students will count by five and ones one the number line as a strategy to tell time to the nearest minute on a clock. |
