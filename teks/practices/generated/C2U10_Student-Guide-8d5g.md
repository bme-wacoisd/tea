Practice 1: Discerning Unprofessional and Unethical Behavior
Example 1
A teacher needs to fill out some forms to complete their taxes. They print the forms on their school printer because their printer at home is out of ink.

Is this behavior unethical? Does it violate the Texas Educators’ Code of Conduct?


Is it unprofessional and something that should be avoided?


Example 2
A teacher has a file cabinet in their classroom with a broken lock. They keep forgetting to notify the school facilities team about the issue, and they keep copies of their students’ IEPs in the cabinet. Is this behavior unethical? Does it violate the Texas Educators’ Code of Conduct?


Is it unprofessional and something that should be avoided?






Practice 2: Discerning Unprofessional and Unethical Behavior through Scenarios
Below each scenario, there are two possible steps that the teacher(s) could take. For each one, circle where it is unethical, unprofessional, or acceptable and explain why.
Scenario A
Mr. A. and Ms. B are art teachers at a high school. One of their colleagues, Mr. F., is running to join the local school board. Mr. A. and Ms. B. have heard Mr. F. talk about how students don’t need art or music classes and that funding for them should be eliminated. Mr. A. and Ms. B. know how much students enjoy their classes and how important they are. They’re worried that Mr. F. will take away these opportunities if he is elected.
Mr. A. and Ms. B volunteer for the campaign of the person running against Mr. F.
Unethical		Unprofessional		Acceptable




Mr. A. and Ms. B take down Mr. F.’s campaign signs.




Scenario B
A parent approaches Mr. S. and asks if she can speak with him confidentially. She shares that one of the other students in the class lives in her neighborhood and that she’s worried about him. He often stops by her house hungry, and it seems like he hasn’t had a bath in a long time. He also has some bruises on his arms. She asks Mr. S. if anyone at the school has called the police to ask them to investigate.
Mr. S. looks at the school’s records and calls the parent to let her know that the school has already called, so she does not need to make a report.
Unethical		Unprofessional		Acceptable




Mr. S. says that he has not noticed any of these things about the student. He tells the parent that it’s probably not a big deal.
Unethical		Unprofessional		Acceptable
