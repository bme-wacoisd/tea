| Rationale/ Summary | Classroom rules are a teacher’s stated expectations for student behavior. A dependable system of rules and procedures provides structure for students. This structure helps students to be engaged with instructional tasks and communicates to students that the teacher cares for them. Rules are few in number, always apply, and must be understood by all. | Classroom rules are a teacher’s stated expectations for student behavior.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think back to Unit 1 and the lessons on rolling out systems and routines. Respond to the following questions based on what you remember from that unit:  What is the impact of an effective rollout on students? What are the criteria for an effective rollout? | Student Guide |
|  | Review guidelines of effective rules T: (Display the 2.11 PPT.) Cold call on students to read the guidelines. Classroom rules are written expectations for behavior in a classroom. Rules are few, always apply, and are easily understood.  They must be explicitly taught and modeled They must be implemented in a way that is FIRM, FAIR, and CONSISTENT Guidelines for writing effective classroom rules (success criteria) Limit to 3–5 in number Rules should be understandable  Rules should be easy to monitor (observable) Rules should be stated positively when it makes sense to do so Rules should address the most important expectations for students | Student Guide PowerPoint |
|  | Practice 1: Rolling Out Classroom Rules T: As teachers, you not only have to establish general rules for your classrooms, but you must explicitly teach, model, and practice the rules. This is called a rollout. A rollout for rules is similar to the rollout for classroom systems and routines.  A successful rollout of rules will align to the following success criteria: Clear, concise, and enthusiastic Starts with the why Models and describes Pre-empt pitfalls Scan and give feedback T: Return to the list of grade and subject-appropriate classroom rules they drafted in the previous lesson. Make any final revisions. S: (Get their materials and make any revisions to the rules.) | Student Guide |
|  | Practice 2: Developing a Roll Out for Classroom Rules  T: You will work in groups to develop a rollout for each of the rules in your list. It should be a brief, positively-framed introduction that shares the purpose for the rule and explicitly teaches and models what the rule should look, sound, and feel like, The rollout is a time for you to model and your students to practice the rules. S: (Develop a rollout for one of the rules in their list based on what they learned during previous lessons on systems and routines.) | Student Guide |
|  | Practice 3: Role Play-Rolling Out Classroom Rules T: (Place students in groups of 3–4.) In rounds, each group member will play the role of “teacher” to roll out their chosen rule. As the “teacher” presents the rule, the other members of the group will play the role of “students” to model and practice the rules as they are presented.  S: (Repeat this process until all group members have had the opportunity to play the “teacher” role.) | Student Guide |
|  | Debrief T: Why is it important explicitly teach and model classroom rules?  S: Explicitly teaching and modeling each classroom rule makes the rule and the teacher’s expectations clear. It provides students the opportunity to see a model of what each rule looks, sounds, and feels and provides opportunities to practice. T: What is the value in having students practice and model the rules as they are introduced?  S: Possible response: creating opportunities for students to practice the rule until they thoroughly understand what is expected of them helps solidify the rule in their mind. It goes back to the saying “practice makes perfect.” Practice also provides an opportunity for students to receive feedback on correct and incorrect implementation of the rule. T: What might be the impact of implementing rules that haven’t been explicitly taught and modeled?  S: Possible response: if a teacher does not explicitly teach and model the classroom rules, it could leave students with misunderstandings or an unclear idea of what the rules look like in action. Also, it leaves room for interpretation or create their own vision of what the rule looks and sounds like. | Student Guide |
