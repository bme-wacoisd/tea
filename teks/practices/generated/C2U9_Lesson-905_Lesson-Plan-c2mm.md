## Unit 9: Feedback

### Lesson 9.05: Effective Feedback Strategies | Practice with 1:1 Conferences





Role Play Script:  Ms. Jefferies and Roberta
T: Good morning, Roberta! I am so glad we get to chat today. How are you?

S: I am good.
T: Great. Our purpose today is to discuss your argumentative writing letter that you wrote to our principal about school gardens. I hoped that we could talk about some of the things you did well and some of the things that you could work on to improve. Hopefully, this feedback will help you to improve your work even more as we move through this class. Before I share any thoughts, you did a reflection about the assignment before this conference. Can you tell me a bit about where you think you did well and maybe some places where you had concerns or struggled?
S:  Sure. This was a hard assignment for me. I was not sure whether I wanted to have a garden or not. There were lots of reasons to have and lots of reasons not to. I got confused about which claim I should make.
T: That is great insight, and I certainly can understand that struggle. The important part to remember is that most of the time the claim you make is not as important as it is to make sure whatever your claim is, you back it with evidence and explain your ideas.

T: In your writing you did establish a claim that the school should have a garden and supported it with details from your passage and research, such as it can be used to teach science and the food can be incorporated into school meals which was good.

T: But like you said, it was kind of confusing as a reader whether you really believed in the claim or not because of the way you added the “bad things” into your writing. How can you make it clear that you support building a garden?

S: I can leave out the bad things or write about how the good things cancel out the bad.

T: Yes. What details or evidence can you add to your argument to make it clear that you believe in your claim?

S:  I could add the information from the article about how school gardens can be used to teach different subjects and real-world skills.

T: Great idea! Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Can you please name what changes you will make to your writing?
S: I am going to write about how the good parts of a school garden cancel out the costs. I am also going to use more detail from the article about how school gardens help students learn different subjects in a real-world way.
T: Great. Now you have a chance to reflect on our conference. Please go and complete the post-conference reflection sheet as I meet with other students. We will talk together again soon.

| Rationale/ Summary | Feedback informs a student and/or teacher about the student’s performance relative to learning goals and outcomes. Creating opportunities for students to receive feedback that is meaningful, specific, and timely allows students to determine their learning strengths and utilize feedback to improve future learning and performance. Formal feedback provides an opportunity for the student and teacher to step back and assess the progress of a student in attaining or mastering learning goals. In this lesson students will be introduced to the practice of one-on-one student conferences as a way of giving formal verbal feedback. Students will practice role playing a 1:1 conference with a student to provide effective feedback. | Feedback informs a student and/or teacher about the student’s performance relative to learning goals and outcomes.

| 2 mins | Bellringer Creating a safe environment for students to receive feedback is an important part of ensuring the feedback is received positively, especially during a student conference. What are some things that a teacher can do to attend to a student’s emotions during a conference? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Review T: Why is attending to a student’s emotions important to creating safety? S: Receiving feedback can be scary or uncomfortable. When students do not feel safe, the brain will not let them hear the feedback. Attending to a student’s emotions about learning can help them to better receive the feedback. T: What are some things that can help in attending to student’s emotions about learning and creating safety? S: Explain the purpose and process for giving feedback, let the student reflect on their own progress first, make sure that you do conferences regularly, so it becomes an expected part of the class. T: Yes, giving feedback requires setting the right purpose and context and attending to safety before giving feedback. Let us explore that more in our lesson today. |  |
| 5 mins | Conducting 1:1 Conferences T: Please locate the conducting 1:1 conferences section on your student guide.  T: As we discussed in the bellringer today, creating a safe environment for student to receive feedback is key. One of the ways that a teacher can do this is by communicating the purpose and process of the feedback. This is an important part of 1:1 conferences with students. In the previous lesson, we discussed the importance of planning for 1:1 conferences. What were some of the key practices for planning 1:1 conferences? S: Plan to keep the conferences short, less than 5 minutes. Have the students reflect on their own ahead of the conference, be sure to share both strengths and areas of improvement. T: Yes, those are all important parts of preparing for a conference. Once the conference arrives there are several things that teachers can do to help ensure a positive feedback experience for students. Start by greeting the student. Briefly explain how the conference will go. Invite students to share their thoughts on how they feel about the task/assignment/progress. Validating their thoughts is important before moving forward. Share your main thoughts on their progress/work. Keep your thoughts to three points or less, starting with the positive. Ask the student if they have questions or need clarification. Provide the student with a goal to work on after the conference. Thank them for their time and sharing their thoughts.  Have students reflect individually on the process of the conference and what they learned/heard after the conference. | PPT Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Model-1:1 Student Conferences  T: In the previous lesson, I modeled the process for planning a 1:1 conference using the scenario with Mrs. Jefferies and Roberta. Locate the scenario information as well as the planning document in your student guide under Model-1:1 Student Conferences.  S: (Locate scenario and planning document.)  T: I am going to play the part of Mrs. Jefferies in the conference so you can see the process of conducting a 1:1 conference, paying attention to the important steps we identified. Can I get a volunteer to play the part of Roberta?  S: (Student volunteers to play the part of Roberta.)  T: Roberta, please come to the front of the room. (Seat student across from you for the conference.) Just play along using the information that was given in the scenario. As we role play, the rest of the class will write down statements that reflect each of the steps in the conference on the chart in your student guide. Are you ready to get started? (Engage in role play with student. Script is provided below the lesson plan in this document.)  S: (Observe the role play.)  T: Now you have seen an example of a 1:1 conference. Thank you to (Student name) for playing the part of Roberta. Take a moment and consider what you heard. We are going to walk through and identify all the places that this conference exhibited the steps for conducting 1:1 conferences we just talked about.  T:  Step number 1 says to start by greeting the student and explaining how the conference will go. What did that look like in the role play?  S: You greeted Roberta and told her the purpose of the conference was to talk about argumentative writing. You wanted to share strengths and areas to improve.  T: How did I get Roberta to share her thoughts about her own writing? The areas she did well and concerns?  S: You reminded her she did a reflection before the conference and then asked her to tell you about things she thinks she did well and where she had concerns or struggled.  T: Yes. That invites the student to share but it is also important to validate their feelings. How did I do that in the conference?  S: You said that was a good insight after she shared and that you could understand that struggle.  T: Yes, that signals to the student that I have heard her thoughts and considered them. This is a big step in making the conference feel safe. Next, I shared some strengths. We always share the strengths first to frame the conference with positivity. What did I say?  S: You mentioned that she did include a claim and supported it with some details. You provided specific examples of details that she used in her writing to support her claim.  T: Yes. That is a key part of this assignment. How did that lead to the feedback for improvement? What did I say there?  S: You built off what she said about struggling to determine which claim she wanted to make and discussed how the bad things created distractions. You gave her two choices to deal with that.  T: Next, it is important to provide time for clarification. How did I do that in this conference?  S: You asked her if the feedback made sense and if she had any questions about the feedback.  T: Great. After clarifying questions, it is important to leave the student with specific goals to work on. In this case, I mentioned that she should work on clarifying her claim and supporting it with more details and evidence.  For Roberta this might look like taking out the reasons why it might be a bad idea or including how her ideas specifically address the negatives. Also restate the claim with reasoning in the conclusion to make it stronger. T: The last steps are to thank the student and provide an opportunity to reflect on the experience of the conference and what they heard. Why is it important to thank the student?  S: It helps to build the relationship of trust between teacher and student.  T: Yes, it shows appreciation to the student for sharing their thoughts and being open to the feedback process. Why is reflection important?  S: It allows the student to think about the experience more and process what was shared.  T: Yes, students need processing time to begin to think about how they can take the feedback and make the adjustments to improve their work. | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Practice: Conducting 1:1 Conferences  T: In our last lesson, you were introduced to the scenario involving Mr. Blankenship and Shawn. You utilized the planning document in your student guide to plan out a conference with Shawn. Locate your planning document from our previous lesson. If you do not have the document, the scenario and some feedback is included for you in your student guide under Practice: Conducting 1:1 Conferences.  S: (Locate Planning document in Student Guide.)  T: Today we are going to utilize your planning to role play the conference between Mr. Blankenship and Shawn. Before we role play, I am going to give you 5 minutes to review your notes and develop a script that will guide your conversation. As you develop the script, think about the example of the conference you observed today. Consider not just the feedback that you must communicate, but the process and way that you communicate that feedback. You can record your script in your student guide under the Practice: Conducing 1:1 Conferences now. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S: (Prepare script for 1:1 conference and record on student guide.)  T: Now that you have a script you will find a partner to role play the conference. One of you will play the role of Mr. Blankenship, and the other will be Shawn. We will do two rounds so that both of you can play the role of the teacher and student. You have 30 seconds to find a partner to work with and decide who will be the teacher first. (Set 30 second timer.)  S: (Find partner for role play & decide on roles.)  T: You will have 5 minutes for Round 1. I will keep time for all the groups. If you finish your conference before the time is up, record some feedback notes about strengths/improvements of the conference in your student guide. Any questions?   S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: You may begin Round 1 of your role-plays now. (Set 5-minute timer. Circulate around the room to support students with their conferences.)  S: (Engage in Round 1 of role play.)  T: Your time for Round 1 is up. We will now switch roles and conduct the role play again. You will have 5 minutes for this round. Remember, if you finish your conference before the time is up, record some feedback notes about strengths/improvements of the conference in your student guide. You may begin now. (Set 5-minute timer.)  S:(Engage in Round 2 of role play.)  T: Time is up for Round 2. You will now have time to reflect with your partner on the experience of conducting a 1:1 conference. There are three reflection questions to answer with your partner about the experience located on your student guide. You will have 5 minutes to reflect and complete the questions. (Set 5-minute timer.)  S: (Reflect on experience with partner and complete reflection questions in student guide.) |  |
