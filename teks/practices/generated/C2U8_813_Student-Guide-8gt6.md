Lesson 8.13: Multiple Means of Action & Expression | Executive Functions
Name:
Date:

Bellringer: Revisit the scenario from yesterday’s bellringer.
Ms. C. just finished a lesson on insects and assigns students a brochure to show what they learned. The brochure must include information and pictures. One student in the class struggles with writing and although she learned a great deal about insects and can elaborately explain her learning, her teacher thinks she has a lack of knowledge and didn’t master the task because she struggled to create her brochure.
How can the teacher use one-on-one conferencing to support this student?



Intro to Executive Functions

Guidelines for Executive Functions



Practice Scenario
Ms. J.is engaging students in writing conferences during a unit on narrative writing. The goal of today’s writing conferences is to focus students on the progress of their writing using the narrative writing rubric. Before their writing conferences, Ms. J. shares a rubric with students to help them consider their own work. Along with the rubric, she has asked them to summarize their reflections with two reflection questions and be prepared to share their thinking with her during their conferences. While she conferences with individual students, the rest of the class is working on revisions to other elements of their stories. It’s Student A’s turn to conference with Ms. J.


Take a minute to review Student A’s rubric and self-reflection in preparation for the modeled conference.

Narrative Storytelling: Self-Reflection
Review the rubric below.

Ms. J.: What are your overall strengths related to your narrative writing?
Student A: I think that my overall strengths are in including a strong opening to introduce the main character and organizing the events in my story in a way that makes sense. I also think I did a good job using a variety of sentence types and using correct conventions.
Ms. J.: What are your opportunities for improvement?
Student A: I don’t think I am very good at using dialogue, description, and/or pacing in my story. I need to work on using specific words, phrases, and sensory details to develop my story. Although I included a logical sequence of events, I had difficulty using transition words.
Ms. J.: Based on this rubric, what is your goal moving forward?
Student A: I would like to start by working on my word choice or using words, phrases, and sensory details to develop my story.
Ms. J.: Let’s look at how we can break this goal down to help you achieve it.

Ms. J.: What steps do you need to take to get you to your goal?

Ms. J.: What are potential obstacles? What are potential solutions for those obstacles?

Ms. J.: As you work, I want you to use the list of descriptive words I provided you and use the narrative writing rubric to self-assess your use of descriptive words to help the reader visualize your ideas. Next time we check-in, bring your current draft of your narrative and the edited draft and we will compare them to see your progress.


Role Play
Take a minute to review the rubric and self-reflection in preparation for the role play conference.

Narrative Storytelling: Self-Reflection
Review the rubric below.

Teacher: What are your overall strengths related to your narrative writing?
Student: I think that my overall strengths are using dialogue, description, and/or pacing in my story and using specific words, phrases, and sensory details to develop my story. I also think I did a good job using a variety of sentence types and using correct conventions.
Teacher: What are your opportunities for improvement?
Student: I don’t think I am very good at creating a story that follows a sequence of events that make sense. I also struggled with using transitional words, phrases, and clauses in my story.
Teacher: Based on this rubric, what is your goal moving forward?
Student: I would like to work on using transitional words to help develop a sequence of events that makes sense.
Teacher: Let’s look at how we can break this goal down to help you achieve it.

Teacher: What steps do you need to take to get you to your goal?
Teacher: One thing that might help you sequence the events in your story is a graphic organizer.
Teacher: What are potential obstacles? What are potential solutions for those obstacles?

Teacher: I will work with you before we end our conference to practice using the graphic organizer to sequence the events in your story.
Teacher: As you work, I want you to use the graphic organizer I provided you and use the narrative writing rubric to self-assess your use of transitional words to help develop a sequence of events in your story that makes sense. Next time we check-in, bring your current draft of your narrative and the edited draft and we will compare them to see your progress.
