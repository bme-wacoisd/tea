### Benefits of Collegial Collaboration

- Helps to build relationships.  As teachers work together, they begin to rely on each other, and you get the sense you are not in it alone.
- Creates a sense of shared responsibility.  In working together, teachers learn that they share the responsibility for student learning and can work to share the burdens as well.
- Strengthens each other.  As teachers work together, they learn to effectively leverage the strengths that each bring to achieve their goals.
- Increases knowledge.  Teachers who collaborate can share best practices and learn from other’s experiences and knowledge.
- Increases student achievement.  Many research studies have shown that students had higher achievement gains in schools with strong collaborative environments.
