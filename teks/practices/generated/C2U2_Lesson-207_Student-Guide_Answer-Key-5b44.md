### Lesson 2.07: Positive Framing | Frame Redirections Positively

Name:
Date:
Bellringer

- Based on what you have learned so far, why is it important to redirect students by assuming the best? How can Assume the Best impact classroom culture and build positive relationships?

- Assuming the best when redirecting students is important because students, regardless of their age, will be motivated through positive interactions and feedback. Students may fall short of expectations due to their excitement, lapse of memory, teacher clarity, or confusion. By assuming the best, the teacher communicates to the students that they trust them to meet expectations and provides an opportunity for students to correct their behavior without risk of being embarrassed or singled out.




Notes on Allow Plausible Anonymity

List the elements of an effective Allow Plausible Anonymity
- Redirects students without using their names: Keeping redirections anonymous helps to eliminate attention-seeking behavior. Additionally, for students who are making a good-faith effort to meet expectations, redirecting anonymously both acknowledges their efforts and still upholds expectations.

- Maintains Economy of Language: Using fewer words helps students to focus on what they need to do to meet expectations and brings everyone back to the lesson as quickly as possible.

- Maintains Emotional Constancy: Again, it’s wise to use a neutral tone when delivering redirections of any kind.






Practice 1: Examples and Non-Examples
List “back-pocket phrases” for Allow Plausible Anonymity. Discuss as a class how this list aligns with the success criteria.


Upgrade the nonexample
Look at statement below that do not meet the success criteria. Work with a partner to identify how the statement does not meet the success criteria and adjust the statement to improve it.



Practice 2: Video Analysis

As you watch “Frame Redirections Positively: Patrick Pastore,” look for examples of the teacher redirecting students without using their names and how he maintains emotional constancy.

The teacher redirects students without using names and maintains a neutral tone.



Practice 3: Creating effective Allow Plausible Anonymity statements

Plan and deliver a redirection focusing on Allow Plausible Anonymity with a partner using the following scenario from Texas TLAC Online. As your partner delivers their Allow Plausible Anonymity statement, use the feedback rubric below to provide specific feedback to your partner on their alignment to the success criteria.

Scenario: Students have just begun a science lab. You notice that several students aren’t wearing their goggles.

As you plan, ensure your redirection:
- Doesn’t name individual students
- Maintains Economy of Language
- Maintains Emotional Constancy

Draft Statement:

Exemplar response: "Pause. Eyes on me, please. If you forgot to put on your goggles, please make sure you have them on now." (Smile and look for follow-through.) "Thank you."


Feedback Rubric



| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Checking | “Please check your responses for complete sentences.” |
| Forgetting | “A couple of us forgot to face our partners with shoulders and eyes when we went into the turn and talk. Let’s try that again.” |
| If… Then… | “If your pencil is in your hand, then please place it in the groove.” |


| Statement | Revision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jason, I want to see you in SLANT with your notes page in front of you. | Possible response: Fourth grade, check yourself to make sure you’re in your best SLANT with your notes page in front of you. | Possible response: the revised statement allows for plausible anonymity by saying “fourth grade” instead of a students name. |


|  | Still Working On It. Provide Suggestions for Improvement. | You got it! Provide Evidence. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Redirects students without using their names: Keep redirections anonymous by refraining from naming individual students. |  |  |
| Economy of Language: Use as few words as possible to focus students on what they need to do to meet expectations and bring everyone back to the lesson as quickly as possible. |  |  |
| Maintains Emotional Constancy: Use a neutral tone and facial expression when delivering redirections of any kind |  |  |
