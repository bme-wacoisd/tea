## Unit 4: Science of Learning

### Lesson 4.06: Prior Knowledge | Practice



Strategy Station Materials: Concept Maps






## Strategy Station Materials: Concept Map Template

How to use: At the center of the concept map, the teacher will place a starting point for the concept map—it may be a focusing question (“How can we harness natural energy?”) or a simply a specific topic (“Types of Energy”). From the center starting point, students can begin to share thoughts and make connections across different concepts related to the main topic at the center. Note that this template is just an example and may include additional related topics and/or configurations of what the map may look like.

## Strategy Station Materials: Anticipation Guides







## Strategy Station Materials: Anticipation Guide Template

How to use: Content-specific statements would be written in the middle of the table for students to react to. Students would fill out the “Before” True/False section prior to completing a learning task (i.e., reading an article). Then, after completing the learning task, students would fill out the “After” True/False section. For each statement, students would have to cite the evidence gathered about each statement to determine whether it is True or False.



## Strategy Station Materials: Self-Assessments







## Self-Assessment Template

How to use: Teachers will select self-assessment areas for students to focus on during a unit. When it is time for students to complete the self-assessment, they will check the box that matches their personal rating of each self-assessment area. There is also a space for notes so students can add additional thoughts to help the teacher better understand their self-assessment scores.

How to use: Sometimes, teachers may use student reflection questions as an additional component to self-assessments. These reflection questions can give teachers insight on what specific challenges and successes students experienced throughout a unit, which can aid teachers as they continue to plan their courses. Additionally, these types of questions can surface any additional questions students may have.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Given each scenario, which strategy(ies) for activating prior knowledge would you use and why? Scenario 1: Mrs. Smith is getting ready to teach about ancient civilizations in her social studies class. She is unsure what her students currently know about the topic since it was also addressed in a previous grade level. Scenario 2: Mr. Brown is planning a unit about the human body and infectious diseases. He knows that many students have misconceptions about how the body may fight diseases and wants to address those misunderstandings head on. Scenario 3: Ms. Rodriguez has finished her unit on multiplication. She wants to know from her students’ perspectives how they are doing with the content. She hopes that they have seen a relationship between multiplication and addition but is unclear if that connection has been solidified. See Exit Ticket Answers for exemplar responses. | Given each scenario, which strategy(ies) for activating prior knowledge would you use and why?

|  | Prior to class, set up three strategy stations for students to rotate to during the Application part of the lesson. Strategy Station Materials can be found at the end of this lesson plan. Students will spend 10 minutes at each station learning more about Concept Maps, Anticipation Guides, and Self-Assessments. Each station should include: Definitions of each strategy Templates for use with each strategy Scenarios for students to use each strategy at the given station.  Pre-group students into small groups to rotate around to the Strategy Stations. | Definitions, Templates, and Scenarios for Each Strategy Station (“Strategy Session Materials”) |
| 3 mins | Bellringer How are KWL Charts good assessments of prior knowledge? T: (Call on a few students to share their thoughts.) S: (Share responses based on discussion and application from prior day’s lesson.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 7 mins | Defining Additional Prior Knowledge Activities T: Today, we are going to learn about and practice additional strategies for assessing prior knowledge. We will focus on concept maps, anticipation guides, and self-assessments. (Define each prior knowledge activity and share examples using the PowerPoint.) Concept Maps: A visual organization and representation of knowledge. Concept maps show how topics and ideas relate to one another. Anticipation Guides: A set of statements about a topic that students react to (can be true/false statements, agree/disagree statements, etc.). Self-Assessments: Assessments that students complete about their individual knowledge of a topic. Self-assessments are not graded but used as a way for students to individually reflect on what they know about a given concept.  S: (Define each prior knowledge activity in their Student Guide.) | PPT Student Guide |
| 33 mins | Practicing Prior Knowledge Activities: Strategy Stations (30 mins) T: For the rest of class, you will have the opportunity to learn more about the strategies we just defined and get to practice with them, too. You will spend 10 minutes at each Strategy Station and your groups are listed on the board. S: (Rotate to each Strategy Station, using the definitions, templates, and scenarios at each station to better understand each strategy. Take additional notes in Student Guide.) T: (Monitor small groups and answer questions. Keep time and let students know when and where to rotate.) Debrief (3 mins) T: (After students have rotated through all three stations, provide a quick debrief of the stations. Note: Students will have already thought about/written down answers to these questions after completing their respective tasks at each Strategy Station.) T: Let’s debrief your experience rotating through the stations. How did each activity align to the success criteria for prior knowledge activities? What did you learn through the activities? When might a teacher want to use each activity? | PPT Student Guide Strategy Station Materials |

| Classroom Scenario: Concept Maps Ms. Stewart’s sixth grade science class is wrapping up their unit about the solar system. To prepare students for their upcoming assessment, she decided that using a concept map might help them see and understand relationships across the many standards they addressed throughout the unit. Ms. Stewart starts the concept map with a key question from their unit: “What relationship does the Earth have to the sun and its moon?” Students can share different ideas to answer the question, such as how Earth revolves around the sun, how the moon causes Earth’s tides, and how different eclipses occur. |

| What are anticipation guides? Anticipation guides are a set of statements about a topic that students react to (can be true/false statements, agree/disagree statements, etc.). |
| --- |


| When might teachers use anticipation guides? In planning for instruction, teachers might decide to use anticipation guides to: Address student misconceptions Activate prior knowledge. Build curiosity around a new topic. Set a purpose for reading/learning new material. |

| Classroom Scenario: Anticipation Guides Mrs. Ballard’s fifth grade math class is getting ready to start a new unit about adding and subtracting fractions. She knows that in fourth grade, her students learned about finding equivalent fractions and ordering fractions, but she is unsure what students may know about adding and subtracting them. She also wants to ensure that she knows what misconceptions students have early on, such as whether students think denominators are added and subtracted, so that she can address them sooner rather than later. She gives her students an anticipation guide at the start of the unit, reviews them after class, and takes note of what misconceptions she sees students already have. She then begins to plan the remainder of her unit, accordingly, making sure to build in time to address these student misconceptions directly. |

| Classroom Scenario: Self-Assessments Mr. Johnson’s history class has been learning about the American political process. Several students are raising valid questions about voting rights, democracy, and government supports for vulnerable populations. He is curious about how students see this course content applying to their everyday lives, so he asks students to complete a self-assessment detailing their reflections on what they have learned thus far in the unit and what additional questions they would like to address moving forward. Mr. Johnson reads students’ responses and is able to map their questions to additional standards and course objectives outlined for the rest of the unit. |
