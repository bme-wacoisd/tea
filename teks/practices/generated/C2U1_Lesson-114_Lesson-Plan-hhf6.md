| TEKS | 7 | The student creates an effective learning environment. The student is expected to: describe and implement a safe and an effective learning environment that incorporates the principles of universal design. demonstrate teacher and trainer characteristics that promote an effective learning environment. identify classroom-management techniques that promote an effective learning environment | The student creates an effective learning environment.

| Rationale/ Summary | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom. This lesson is the final in a series of six focused on the introduction of systems and routines. For systems and routines to work, teachers must get student buy-in. One way to increase student buy-in is to help students own the systems and routines. Careful attention to the roll-out of a routine or system can increase student ownership. In this lesson, students will continue to practice the implementation of a routine roll-out with classmates who were not involved in drafting the routine itself. Students will incorporate the feedback received during their first practice round during Lesson 1.13. | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Imagine you are talking to a brand-new teacher a few days before the first day of school. What would you tell this teacher about the importance of implementing systems and routines in his/her classroom?  What tips would you provide about how to get it right in the first weeks of school? See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Imagine you are talking to a brand-new teacher a few days before the first day of school.

|  | In Lesson 1.13, students worked groups to practice and receive feedback on their routine roll-out. They will need to work in the same groups for this lesson. |  |
|  | Considering the size of your groups, prepare enough copies of the Feedback Rubric in the Student Guide so that every student can complete one rubric for each member of their group. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Review the completed Feedback Rubrics that you received from your group members during our last class. Do you have any clarifying questions for your peers? What is the most important piece of feedback you received? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Small Group Practice: Clarifying Questions T: Set aside your bellringers for a moment. You will use them when you begin to work in groups.  T: Today, you’ll be working in your groups again. Return to the same place in the classroom where your group worked yesterday.  S: (Move to location assigned by teacher during previous lesson.)  T: We’ll begin with 5 minutes for you to ask your group members any clarifying questions you wrote in response to the bellringer. This isn’t time for you to agree or disagree with what they provided to you; it’s time for you to ask questions about anything you didn’t understand. 5 minutes begins now.  T: (Set 5-minute timer.)  S: (Ask clarifying questions about completed Feedback Rubrics to group members.)  T: (Circulate to answer questions and provide support as needed.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Independent Practice: Roll-Out Revisions T: You will now have 5 minutes of independent work time to revise your roll-out speech and the practice you designed to allow “students” to learn the routine. Stay in your groups, but this is independent work time.  T: (Set 5-minute timer.)  S: (Work independently to revise roll-out speeches and practice.)  T: (Circulate to answer questions and provide support as needed.) | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Small-Group Practice: Routine Roll-Out and Practice T: Each member of the group will again practice the roll-out of the routine you designed. The student practicing is acting as the teacher, and everyone else is acting as the students. Those who are acting as students should complete a Feedback Rubric. I am going to hand out copies of the rubric so that you will have enough to complete one for each member of your group.  T: (Distribute copies of Feedback Rubric.)  T: Like yesterday, you have 12 minutes of practice time. Begin.  T: (Set 12-minute timer.)  S: (Rotate through practicing their routine and providing feedback to their classmates.)  T: Give the completed Feedback Rubrics to your group members.  T: (Exchange Feedback Rubrics.)  T: Take 2 minutes to silently review the feedback you received.  T: (Set 2-minute timer).  S: (Review silently feedback from group members.) | Copies of Feedback Rubric from Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Can I have some volunteers share one piece of feedback they received from a group member and how you improved your roll-out as a result?  S: Responses will vary based on feedback received from group members and resulting revisions. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
