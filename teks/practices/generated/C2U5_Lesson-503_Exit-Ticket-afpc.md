Read the scenario below. Identify and analyze the assessments the teacher uses. Use the graphic organizer to guide your analysis.
In a lesson about maps and how to draw maps to represent information, Mr. Hillary begins by providing his students with an image of a map and asking them to describe what they see and what they know about maps. Next, he teaches key elements of maps and then engages students in a discussion about key elements as they annotate the map together based on his questions (Where on this map do you see the legend?  How does this map show elevation?). Students then work in partners to draw their own map of the playground, ensuring that they use the essential elements of a map in their work. Finally, as an exit ticket, Mr. Hillary provides students a new map and asks them to annotate the important parts.
