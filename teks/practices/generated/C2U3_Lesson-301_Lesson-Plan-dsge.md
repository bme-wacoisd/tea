| 5 mins | Bellringer What are the three most important things for a teacher to know about you as an individual? Why is it important for a teacher to know these things? | Student Guide PPT |
| 6 mins | Why Learn About Students?  T: (Display the scenario below on the PPT, ask a student volunteer to read it aloud.)  It is the first week of a new school year at West Elementary School. Mrs. K, a fifth-grade reading teacher, greets her first period class at the door and instructs them to sit in assigned seats. She introduces herself, goes over the rules and consequences, reviews the expectations for the course, then starts teaching the first full lesson.   By the end of the week, Mrs. K notices some behavior problems in the class. Jaden frequently interrupts by making jokes and funny noises. Alex talks to the students next to him and sometimes copies their work. Emma has fallen asleep twice and Jasmine is often out of her seat. The disruptions make it difficult for Mrs. K. to teach and frustrate the rest of the class. She thinks, “My students this year are such behavior problems.” To be continued…  T: Turn and talk to a partner about what you think is going on in Mrs. K’s class. (Ask several students to share their comments.)  T: (Display the scenario below on the PPT, ask a student volunteer to read it aloud.)  It is the first week of school at West Elementary school. Mrs. G, a fifth-grade science teacher greets her second period class at the door. The class includes the same students from Mrs. K’s first period. She directs them to their assigned seats, and asks them to write down the following information: The name they want to be called and how to pronounce it. How they feel about themselves as a science student. The three most important things that a teacher should know about them. She then introduces herself, goes over the rules and consequences, reviews the expectations for the course, and leads them in a short and engaging science activity.  After reviewing their responses and work from the first day, she learns the following: Jaden likes to participate in class but gets bored in school. Alex is learning English as a second language. Emma has a new baby sister at home. Jasmine has trouble seeing the board.   T: (Give students a few minutes to answer the questions in the student guide)  T: What did Mrs. K and Mrs. G. do that was the same?  S: Greeted students at the door, assigned seats, explained rules and procedures, taught content.  T: What was different?  S: Mrs. K taught a full lesson on the first day. Mrs. G. led a short activity and used class time to ask her students about themselves.  T: What did Mrs. G learn about her students that might explain some of the perceived “behavior problems” that Mrs. K experienced?  S: Jaden needs opportunities to participate in class or he will get bored and disruptive. Alex is trying to understand and participate in class. Emma might not be getting enough sleep because of the new baby. Jasmine is trying to see the board.  T: How can Mrs. G use the information she gathered from her students to make instructional decisions?  S: (Answers will vary, but guide students toward these suggestions: She can give Jaden regular opportunities to participate, more challenging work, and a classroom job. She can make sure that Alex has the right supports to help him learn. In class, she can provide opportunities for Emma to be active. She could also talk with Emma’s family about the importance of getting enough sleep. She can move Jasmine’s seat to the front of the room.)  T: What could be the result if Mrs. K continues to see her students as “behavior problems” without learning more about them?  S: She may think they are misbehaving on purpose. She may develop a negative mindset about her students.  T: Yes. When a teacher does not learn about their students, they may make assumptions about why students behave and learn the way they do. These assumptions can be harmful to students and inhibit effective teaching and learning. It is important for teachers to learn about their students as learners, community members, and individuals.  T: It is important for teachers to learn about their students as learners, community members, and individuals. When teachers do this, they build positive relationships with their students based on respect and rapport.  The activity Mrs. G used is a quick student survey. This is a way for teachers to learn valuable information about their students. This information can be used to guide decisions that create a positive environment and help students learn.  What questions in Mrs. G.’s activity would help her learn about her students as individuals?  S: All of them. She learns what they prefer to be called, what they think of themselves as a learner, and what they think is most important for a teacher to know about them.  T: What questions would help her learn about her students as learners or members of a community?  S: Possibly questions 2 and 3. She will learn about how students see themselves as learners in question 2. Students may volunteer information about themselves as learners or community members in question 3.  T: As teachers get to know students, there are many ways to learn more about them. Some ways that teachers learn more about their students include: Student Surveys. Teachers may use student surveys to learn more about students informally. A more formal and non-evaluative type of survey is a student perception survey, which can be tailored to capture information and feedback directly from students about the way a classroom works and how students are learning in their given environment.  Non-Academic Conversations. Taking time to listen to students share about their lives is a simple yet effective way to learn more about students to better meet their needs. Engaging in non-academic conversations during lunch time, breaks, class transitions, or during any other moments of downtime during the school day can provide teachers with more insight about students’ lives outside of school. Family Relationships. As teachers get to know their students, they also must take time to get to know students’ families. Families can provide greater contextual information about their child, such as why a student has been more tired during class lately or how their child’s favorite sport is soccer. All information coming from families is valuable to teachers to learn more about their students. Typically, student surveys are conducted at the beginning of the year, whereas non-academic conversations and building family relationships occur throughout the school year.  S: (Take notes in Student Guide about ways teachers learn about students.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 9 mins | How Knowledge of Students Drives Instruction T: Now that we’ve talked about some ways teachers can get to know their students, we must consider how knowledge of students can drive instruction. Teachers take what they know about their students beyond the classroom and guide their instruction by finding ways to make the content engaging and relevant to the life experiences of the students.  T: (Hand out 3.01 Scenario: Jenny.)  T: The handout you were just given is a sample of Ms. G’s student survey for a student named Jenny. Take two minutes to review Jenny’s survey responses on your own.   T: (Set timer for two minutes.)  S: (Review Jenny’s survey responses.)  T: Once Ms. G’s students fill out the surveys, she will review them and use the information to help inform her instruction for that student.   T: What are some things that Ms. G can learn about Jenny as an individual?  S: Jenny is a morning person, she likes to perform/be in the spotlight, she lives in a house with five other people—and four fish!   T: What are some things that Ms. G can learn about Jenny as a learner?  S: The survey said she does not always get along with other people, so she may not work well in groups. She likes math and school and likes doing her best. She likes projects and presentations, so she may participate actively in school.  T: What are some things that Ms. G can learn about Jenny as a member of her family?  S: She has chores and responsibilities, she is the oldest child, her mother helps her  with her homework.  T: Now, how might Ms. G use this information to better instruct Jenny in math class?  S: Answers will vary but may include: Jenny likes math, and she likes to present, so Ms. G. could ask her to model problems for the whole class; if Jenny was expressing interest in a particular topic, Ms. G could give her resources to practice at home, etc. She may create opportunities for Jenny to be in groups where roles are clearly defined to decrease arguing. | Student Guide PPT Student Survey Sample: Jenny |
| 15 mins | Practice T: Now we’re going to look at two other survey results from Ms. G’s class. In your Student Guide, find the section titled “Student Survey Samples: Robert & Tatiana.”  S: (Locate section in the Student Guide.)  T: I am going to hand out two additional student surveys from Ms. G.’s class. I will set a timer for 8 minutes. In that time, review each survey and answer the questions in the Student Guide.  T: (Set timer for 8 mins.)  S: (Complete questions in Student  Guide.)  T: Now I am going to set the timer for five minutes. Turn to a neighbor and discuss the insight Ms. G can gain from her student surveys.  S: (Turn and talk.) | Student Guide PPT Student Survey Samples: Robert & Tatiana |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Why is it important for teachers to take intentional time to learn about students and their interests inside and outside of the classroom?  S: Answers will vary but may include: It is important for teachers to learn about students because… It can help teachers plan for effective instruction in their classrooms. It can help teachers make effective connections between student interests and content. |  |
