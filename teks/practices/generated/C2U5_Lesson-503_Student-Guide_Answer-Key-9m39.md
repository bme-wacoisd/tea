### Lesson 5.03: Best Practices for Formal and Informal Formative Assessment

Name:
Date: Text

Bellringer: Read the scenario below. As you read, look for formative assessments the teacher uses. Underline every instance of a formative assessment that you see.
Ms. Fisher is beginning a lesson about main idea in her second-grade classroom. She tells the students that they are going to be reading an informational text about prairie dogs. To begin, she tells students that she is going to read a few statements about main idea. Using individual whiteboards, the students draw a check mark if the statement is true or an X if it is not true. The students hold up their whiteboards after each statement. Next, Ms. Fisher provides an explanation of main idea, addresses common misconceptions, and the class begins reading the text.

The class reads a few paragraphs together, and then Ms. Fisher models the skill by thinking aloud about the main idea. Then students begin to practice the skill. After reading a few more paragraphs, Ms. Fisher asks them to turn and talk to share the main idea with a neighbor. As students discuss, she moves around the room listening to their conversations. If she hears students share details of the story, she reminds them that details support the main idea and asks them to think again about the main idea. The class engages in multiple rounds of reading and discussing while Ms. Fisher circulates and listens. Using a checklist, she places a check next to each student’s name if she hears them correctly summarizing the main ideas or explaining main idea correctly to their partner. She puts a star next to student names if they confuse details with main idea or are not able to summarize the main idea.

To wrap up the lesson , Ms. Fisher asks students questions about main idea. Her questions include the following: What is the main idea? How does finding the main idea help us when we are reading? How can we find the main idea? What supports the main idea in a story? Finally, she gives students an exit ticket. For the exit ticket, Ms. Fisher provides a new text that students read on their own. As they finish the reading, students write a 2-sentence summary of the main idea.

Introduction to Best Practices for Formal and Informal Formative Assessments
Best Practices for Using Formative Assessments
- Create a portfolio with a variety of assessments over time
- Use throughout a lesson
- Use to make strategic decisions



#### Practice 1: Bellringer Analysis


#### Practice 2: Partner Analysis

Read the scenario below. As you read, look for formative assessments the teacher uses. Underline every instance of a formative assessment that you see and then use the graphic organizer to analyze each assessment.

Ms. Terrance’s class is learning to tell time to the nearest five minutes. As a bellringer, she asks students to list their five times tables as quickly as possible. She tells them they have 60 seconds to write as many multiples of five as they can.
After the bellringer is over, Ms. Terrance guides students in a discussion to review what they already know about the clock. Her questions include: Each number on the clock represents how many minutes? How many fives does it take to get all the way around the clock? How do you show time on a clock? Ms. Terrance moves into guided practice as she moves the minute hand around the clock and asks students as a whole group to read the time at each five-minute interval. She then shows the clock face with different times and asks individuals to use their white boards to write the corresponding time. Ms. Terrance keeps track of who is getting the times right and who is not. She shows students the correct answer after each problem.
After their whole group discussion and practice, Ms. Terrance provides students with a practice set to work on in partners. The practice set includes two types of problems: times (like 7:35) and clock faces. For the times, students draw the clock face. For the clock face, students write the times.
At the end of class, Ms. Terrance asks for a thumb up, thumb sideways, or thumbs down depending on how students are feeling about the lesson and then provides an exit ticket that shows a number of clock faces. Individually, students record the corresponding time.

| Formal Assessment | Structured instructional activities within the lesson in which students and teachers assess the progress of student’s learning to help in the learning process (practice sets, homework, fluency assessment) |
| --- | --- |
| Informal Assessment | Quick conversational or observation-based checks for understanding (thumbs up, white boards, first to 5, feedback on students verbal response) |
| Pacing | The timing of instruction that includes how fast to move through new material and when to shift from one lesson segment to another |
| Reteaching | Teaching material in a new way when necessary |
| Remediation | Teaching content again to students who didn't learn it the first time; filling in gaps |
| Strategic Grouping | Placing students in small groups with purpose and intentionality based on reteaching needs |


| Formative Assessment | Formal or Informal? | What is Assessed? | Teacher’s Possible Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| True/False Bellringer | Formal | Prior knowledge and misconceptions | Speed up or slow down the pacing of the lesson. Specifically address misconceptions and skip information students already know. |
| Turn and talk with a neighbor | Informal | Current group and individual understanding of main idea | Based on her checklist she can begin to consider strategic groups for reteaching if necessary. She might also consider pacing. If most groups are struggling, she might want to slow down. If she hears common challenges among partners, she can reteach or model another example. |
| Discussion questions about main idea | Informal | Current group understanding of main idea | Begin to consider next steps for her next lesson. |
| Exit ticket - 2-sentence summary | Formal | Individual understanding of main idea | Strategically group students either for reteaching and enrichment – students who are ready to move on can begin applying the concept to longer texts while she works on the skill with students who need more support OR pair one student with a strong understanding with a student who is challenged by the concept for peer teaching and support. |


| Formative Assessment | Formal or Informal? | What is Assessed? | Teacher’s Possible Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| List multiples of 5 | Formal | Ability to multiply by 5’s | Provide remediation for students who do not know their 5 times tables. |
| Clock discussion | Informal | What students know about clocks and telling time | Determine pacing. Are students ready to move forward? If not, reteach basic information about the clock. |
| Whole group practice with whiteboards | Informal | Who can correctly display times on their clock faces | Determine strategic groups for the next activity. Pair one student who gets it with one who is still working on it for peer teaching. |
| Practice set | Formal | Whether or not students are able to tell time and show time by 5’s when they have a partner | Consider options for reteaching, remediation, and enrichment. |
| Thumb up, sideways, down | Informal | Student feelings about the lesson | Check in independently with students who indicated thumbs down or sideways |
| Exit ticket | Formal | Whether or not students are able to tell by 5’s independently | Consider options for reteaching, remediation, and enrichment. Determine whether the class as a whole is ready to move to the next lesson. |
