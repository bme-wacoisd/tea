What are the three guidelines for representation? How does each guideline provide access to rigorous content for all students?

Read the scenario below and then answer the related questions.
Mr. M is about to teach his students about the life cycle of a frog. First, Mr. M shows an image of a frog on the screen. Then, he tells students that they are going to be learning about life cycles by learning about frogs. Next, Mr. M reads a nonfiction book about the life cycle of a frog. As he reads, he pauses to show images of each of the steps in the life cycle and uses his life cycle wheel to show students where they are in the life cycle.
How does Mr. M incorporate options for comprehension?

Mr. M has chunked information into smaller parts. By pausing between each step, he provides time for students to process and comprehend the information. He has also provided support for visualization by using a book with images.

What else could Mr. M add to incorporate additional options for comprehension to provide access to rigorous content for all students.

Mr. M could add an opportunity at the beginning of the lesson for students to turn and talk with a partner about what they know about frogs. He could allow time for students to share what they heard from a partner and record their ideas on the board. This would activate their prior knowledge. Mr. M could also provide students with their own blank life cycle wheel to use as a notes catcher. This would help them to organize their information and take note in a clear and logical fashion.
