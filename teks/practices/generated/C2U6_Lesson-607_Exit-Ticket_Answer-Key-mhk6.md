- Why is scaffolding important?
It allows learners to take in, process, and learn information in small increments and in a logical order. It allows learners to build on their prior knowledge and provides the right amount of scaffolding needed to build understanding toward mastery. Scaffolding learning gradually shifts the cognitive load from the teacher to the student. Learning starts with the teacher doing a lot of modeling to demonstrate the concept or skill. Once students are ready, the teacher invites students to participate in the learning through guided practice. This is where students can apply their learning with teacher and peer support. The final stage is where students independently apply their new learning. This process sets students up for success, builds on student learning, and increases confidence in students.
