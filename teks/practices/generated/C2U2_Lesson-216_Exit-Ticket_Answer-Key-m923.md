Analyze the scenario below to determine how well Ms. Mason used the Radar technique. Use the rubric below to provide specific evidence from the scenario to support your response and make suggestions for improvement.

Ms. Mason is teaching a science lesson. Ms. Mason instructs her class by saying, “please find the rock sample labeled #1 and place it in front of you.”  As she does so, she glances down, using the moment just after her direction to double-check her notes and glance at her watch to see how she’s doing for time.

Instead, she looked down to check her watch and see how she was doing on time.

| Pastore’s Perch: Observes from the corner of the room | Ms. Mason did not move to Pastore’s Perch to quickly and easily scan the room to ensure students were meeting her expectation. Instead, she looked down to check her watch and check pacing. Ms. Mason should have moved to the corner of the room (Pastore’s Perch) and scanned the room to ensure students were accurately completing the task. |  |
