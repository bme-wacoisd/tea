### Exit Ticket

- Complete the chart below. In the first column, list the five Trust Generators. In the second column provide examples from the text of how Mr. C used the trust generator. If Mr. C did not use the trust generator, provide a suggestion as to how he could implement it.
- Lars is a student in Mr. C science class. The class is working in small groups to complete a science lab. Mr. C is in the middle of explaining how this lab relates to a student that is currently happening at the local nature preserve where the students recently went on a field trip, when a student yells out, “Stop telling me what to do! Just because you are the leader of the group doesn’t mean you can boss me around!” Then, the student slams his book shut and returns to his desk. He pulls out his sketch book from art class and begins sketching. Mr. C quickly moves towards Lars’ desk. He kneels beside Lars’ desk and sees that he is sketching cars. Mr. C begins his conversation with Lars by saying, “Wow, that’s a really good sketch. I was into cars, too, when I was younger, but I wasn’t ever that good at drawing them. How is your entry for the art competition going?” The student tells him that it’s almost complete, but he doesn’t elaborate. Then, Mr. C says, “I notice you are not getting along with your group. Are you having a hard day? It’s not like you to get frustrated so easily.”
