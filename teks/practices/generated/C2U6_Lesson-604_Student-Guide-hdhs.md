### Lesson 6.04: Standard & Objective Alignment

Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Consider this 3rd grade standard:

The student understands the purposes of earning, spending, saving, and donating money. The student is expected to:
Identify ways of earning, spending, saving, and donating money.

Work with a partner to underline the verbs in the student expectation and brainstorm ways in which students would show their learning of this concept.

Intro to Lesson Standards & Objectives
Write the definition and notes for each term below as they are discussed in the lesson.


#### Practice #1

You are going to work in groups to examine the standards and objectives for a grade 1 science lesson plan. You will look at the standards in the lesson plan to identify the verbs and the content and use that to determine what students need to know and do. You will then analyze each objective in the lesson plan to determine which standard it aligns to.





#### Practice #2

Review the standards (same as in practice #1) and analyze the objectives in the lesson plan to determine if they are aligned to the standards. Provide evidence to support your claim. Make suggestions for improvement.
