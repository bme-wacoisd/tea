Intro to Least Invasive Interventions

Video Analysis: “Nonverbal Interventions: Juliana Worrell”


What do you see students and teacher doing in this video?
Responses may include:
- 	A student speaking
- 	Students listening
- 	Gestures
- 	Hand motions
- 	Students responding together

How would the flow of discussion have changed if Juliana had redirected students verbally?
Possible Response: The teacher would have had to stop teaching, which may cause students to lose engagement and focus

Video Notes

What is nonverbal intervention? What does it look like in the classroom?
Gestures, silently modeling a desired behavior, facial expressions, eye contact, etc. that reinforce expectations, manage classroom transitions, and keep group discussions productive
What does it mean to “scaffold up” to the use of nonverbal interventions?
Possible response: at the beginning of the year, corrections have a more verbal component. Teacher uses the same non-verbal every single time. Over time the motion can become smaller and smaller.






Notes on Five Keys for Effective Nonverbals

Practice: Nonverbals in Action
Choose one of the five keys to focus on as you watch Doug's analysis of Nonverbals in Ms. Willey's & Ms. Hinton's third-grade classes.  Take notes on your identified key as you watch.


| Redirection | Changing the course or direction of one’s actions |
| --- | --- |
| Intervention | Steps to help one improve in their area of need |
| Least Invasive Intervention | Redirecting an undesired behavior with minimal disruption |
| Nonverbal Interventions | Gestures, silently modeling a desired behavior, facial expressions, eye contact, etc. that reinforce expectations, manage classroom transitions, and keep group discussions productive |
| Emotional Constancy | Maintaining a calm demeanor by managing tone and body language |
| Reinforce | A response to behavior that increases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated |


| Key Element | Description | Evidence from Juliana Video |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reinforce Expectations You Already Taught | Nonverbals are useful for reinforcing expectations you've already taught. If you try to use a Nonverbal to "teach" an expectation, you're likely to confuse students. | Juliana has clearly taught students to track the speaker and reinforces that with nonverbal cues. |
| Redirect Early | Address students’ off-task behavior sooner, rather than later. This allows you to step in with a smaller redirection. Once a behavior is “major,” it is very hard to correct it nonverbally. | Juliana immediately redirects students when she notices them not meeting the expectation. |
| Deliver Nonverbals While Teaching | Continue instruction per usual, circulating throughout the room as you teach. This ensures that the task of learning continues for the class while you redirect behavior as needed. | Juliana scans while she is teaching and while a student is sharing her ideas and redirects behaviors as needed. |
| Communicate the Solution | Show students exactly what they need to do to adjust their behavior as opposed to focusing on what they should stop doing. Make clear gestures (e.g., reminding a student to take notes by pretending to write) and model where appropriate (e.g., communicating to a student to sit up by modeling strong posture yourself) | Juliana uses nonverbal cues to communicate to students what they need to do. |
| Model Emotional Constancy | Nonverbals can carry an emotional valence, whether positive, neutral, or negative. A harsh, hands-down gesture delivered with a scowl amplifies rather than minimizes invasiveness. Strive to deliver your Nonverbal Interventions neutrally or with a touch of warmth. | Juliana’s body language is neutral as she redirects students. |


| Key for Effective Nonverbals | Video Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Reinforce Expectations You Already Taught | It is evident that students have already been taught the expectation |
| Redirect Early | The teacher redirects immediately |
| Deliver Nonverbals While Teaching | Gesture to tell students to put their hands down |
| Communicate the Solution | The gestures are clear and tell the student exactly what he needs to do to improve his behavior |
| Model Emotional Constancy | Maintains neutral body language; provides a smile even after multiple reminders |
