| 5 mins | Bellringer:  What’s the difference between quantitative and qualitative data? What is a learner profile? What actions might teachers take to gather the quantitative and qualitative data used to develop student profiles? | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 Mins | Using Student Profiles to Make Instructional Decisions T: Let’s look at our bellringer responses.  What is the difference between quantitative and qualitative data?  S: Quantitative data are data that can be counted and expressed in numbers. Quantitative data answer questions like “how many?” and “how often?”  Qualitative data are data that are expressed in words. Qualitative data answers questions like “why?” and “how?”  T: Good! What is a learner profile?  S: A learner profile is a complete picture of a student’s learning preferences, strengths, and challenges.  T:  Now, what actions might teachers undertake to collect the quantitative and qualitative data used to develop learner profiles?  S: Answers will vary, but may include: Have informal conversations and ask questions. Access grades and other academic data. Talk to student’s previous teachers, coaches, club sponsors, etc. Do classroom ice-breaker activities. Review student records. Give assignments that ask students to share more about themselves. Send home a survey for students’ families to complete. Administer a student survey. Conduct home visits and family interviews. Maintain a family communication tracking log.  T: Once teachers have gathered quantitative and qualitative data and recorded it in learner profiles, they are now ready for the most important part: using the data to make instructional decisions. T: There are many types of decisions you can make based on what you know about students. Some common ones include: intentional grouping providing relevant examples creating meaningful activities facilitating pertinent discussions capitalizing on students’ strengths, interests, and curiosities identifying when students need help; and supporting them effectively when needed. S: (Add types of decisions to Student Guide.) T: Now, let’s analyze a learner profile and consider how we might use the quantitative and qualitative data to build a trusting relationship and make decisions that hold the student to high expectations. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Model & Practice  T:  Consider this excerpt from the learner profile of Grover:  T: (Read learner profile excerpt aloud for students and share slide with learner profile excerpt on it for students to follow along):  Student Learning Preferences: X	Likes to learn by working alone. ☐	Like to learn by working with others. X 	Learns best in silence. ☐ 	Learns best with some background noise. X 	Likes to stay in one place while learning. ☐ 	Likes to move around while learning. ☐	Likes to ask peers for help. X 	Likes to ask the teacher for help.    T: What quantitative or qualitative data might the teacher be able to leverage when making instructional decisions?  S: (Grover likes to learn by working alone. Grover learns best in silence. Grover likes to stay in one place while learning. Grover likes to ask the teacher for help. Grover is a quick a quick learner but is trying to improve his quality of work by slowing down, improving penmanship, and double-checking responses. Grover is artistic and athletic. When Grover needs help, he asks the teacher, although he is reluctant to do so in front of peers.  T:  Great, that’s a lot of information.  Now let’s apply it to instructional decision making.  Consider this example:  Ms. H has assigned an individual project for the week. At the end of class on Friday, all students need to turn in their assignment. Based on this excerpt from Grover’s learner profile, how should Ms. H check-in with Grover?  S: Ms. H should check in privately with Grover during class on Tuesday to see if he needs help. Ms. H should check in privately with Grover towards the end of the week to ensure quality of work and that he is double-checking responses.  T: That’s a great strategy. Why should that be her plan?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Grover doesn’t like saying that he needs help in front of his peers.  Also, Ms. H knows that he’ll probably work on the harder questions first and may try to work quickly.)  T:  Excellent! Now let’s look at Grover’s full learner profile and consider some additional scenarios and instructional decisions.  Student Profile Analysis  T: Remember that teachers develop learner profiles by assembling data from a multitude of sources, including:   Informal Conversations Interest Inventories Communication Logs Family Interviews Formative Assessments Academic Data Artifacts from External Stakeholders Home Visits Funds of Knowledge  T: Spend 5 minutes read and analyze the learner profile, making note of the quantitative and qualitative data that might be leveraged to make instructional decisions. Then, with a near neighbor, discuss the quantitative and qualitative data that might be used to make instructional decisions.  S: (work independently)  T: (Keep time on the board.)  T: Now spend 5 minutes sharing data that might be used to build a trusting relationship and make instructional decisions. S: (Share with partner.)  T: (Keep time on the board.) |  |
| 20 mins | Synthesizing Information to Make Instructional Decisions  T:  Now let’s look at some instructional scenarios to see how can apply our knowledge of this data.  Spend 10 minutes reviewing the scenarios in your student guide, formulating an instructional decision for each, and rationalizing your thoughts.  S: (Complete columns for Teacher Response and Explanation in the Student Guide.)  T: (Keep time on the board for students to see how much time they have remaining to work.)  T: Let’s consider the scenarios in your Student Guide.  Ms. H notices that Grover has already finished his math assignment while other students in the class are struggling. What should she do?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H might have Grover work with a small group or with individual students that are struggling.)  T: Another great strategy! Why do you recommend that?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H knows that Grover learns the most when given the opportunity to share his learning or help his peers.)  T: How about the next one:  Grover is working on an assignment with three of his classmates. His three group members want to stay after-school to ask Ms. H for help with their assignment. What should Ms. H do?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H asks the group members if they can meet with her during lunch or recess to work on their assignment.)  T:  Good! And your rationale?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H knows that Grover won’t be able to stay after-school because he must walk his sister home. To avoid him being left out of the group, she tries to find another time to provide extra help.)  T: How about this one:  Grover has been working hard to improve in social studies, but he’s been struggling.  He’s not feeling confident in his academic skills.  S: (Answers will vary but may include: As students are working in centers during math, Ms. H asks Grover to help students at the most challenging center.)  T:  Good, and why is that?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H wants to help Grover be more confident. He enjoys helping his peers with math, and it allows him to demonstrate his skill in this topic.)  T: Next one: Ms. H needs to help students review for an upcoming vocabulary quiz. What strategy might she employ?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H might want to make the review a competition or a game.)  T: Great, and your explanation?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H knows that Grover enjoys competing and that he will likely be very engaged.)  T:  And the last scenario: Grover has expressed concern over a social studies project on citizenship. He seems unmotivated and disengaged. What should Ms. H do?  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H might encourage Grover to infuse the project with his creativity and passion for art. Ms. H might ask Grover to learn about athletes that have become American citizens. Ms. H could have students present their work to show what they have learned.)  T:  Share your reasoning.  S: (Answers will vary but may include: Ms. H knows that Grover is very artistic and will likely be excited to bring creativity to the project. Ms. H knows that Grover likes sports and may find it interesting to learn more about some of his favorite athletes. Ms. H knows that Grover likes to share his learning with peers.)  T: Excellent! | Student Guide PPT |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T:  Why is it important to create learner profiles for each student:  S:  Learner profiles serve to curate and organize quantitative and qualitative data that can be leveraged to make instructional decisions. |  |
