### Example of Sequencing in a Lesson


| Activity | Skills/Concepts |
| --- | --- |
| Warm-up | Producing short vowel sounds for i, a, and o |
| Sound Riddles | Repeat, identify, and produce words with /b/ |
| Minimal Pairs | Recognizing the difference between the /b/ sound and /p/ sound |
| Rhyming Words | Identifying rhyming words with /b/ and /p/ |
| Spelling /b/ | Teacher models how to write B, students practice writing B |
| Student Chaining | Students make new words from old words by chaining one letter in the word. All the words use the short vowels o, a, and i and the /b/ and /p/ sounds. |

- What do you notice about how the learning is sequenced? What could the teacher do to better sequence the instruction and build student understanding?
- Respond to the following questions:
- How does intentionally sequencing the concepts and skills in a lesson support student learning?
- How does the sequencing of a lesson relate to the Science of Learning?
- What might be the impact of a lesson where the learning is not sequenced?
