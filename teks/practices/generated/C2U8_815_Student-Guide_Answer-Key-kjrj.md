| English Language Arts Practice Lesson: Norse Mythology, the “K”-sound and homophones Third grade | Amplify Texas Elementary Literacy | Unit 6 | Lesson 1 (page 12) | The lessons you will teach starts on page 12 and runs to page 15.  Additionally, you should read the advance preparation on page 10 (excluding the last bullet). Note that on page 14 the lesson makes reference to the name Loki. As part of this unit, students are reading a book titled Gods, Giants, and Dwarves. The individual code chart refers to the top line of the chart at the bottom of page 14.  and provides students all five of the different spellings for /k/. |
| Math Practice Lesson: Explore the relationship between human capital and income. Third grade | Eureka Math TEKS Edition | Module 6 | Lesson 1 (page 12) | The lesson you will teach starts on page 12 in the section titled “Concept Development” and ends on page 14 with the Problem Set.   We will not teach the Fluency Practice section for this lesson. The objective can be found on page 11. Your students will need a document called the Problem Set where they record their responses to different questions, read a table in a section of the lesson, and practice. |
| Science: Observe and compare the life cycle stages of organisms. Third grade | PhD Science TEKS Edition | Module 2 | Lesson 17 (page 184) | The lesson you will teach starts on page 184 and runs through page 187 (intro to Butterfly Life Cycle and beginning part of sequencing organism cards). You will need the Science Lesson Resource document which includes a butterfly picture for the beginning of your lesson and a card sort for your students to arrange life cycles. Note that your lesson includes a 2-minute video. You should have access to a computer during your sample lesson to access and play the video. |

| Guidelines | Evidence of UDL | How else can you incorporate UDL into your delivery of this lesson? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recruiting Interest | Links to prior learning during the Introducing the Reader section. |  |
| Sustaining Effort and Persistence |  | Provide frequent reminders of the learning target and explain why it matters. Focus feedback on effort and improvement over performance |
| Self-Regulation |  | Offer activities that encourage self-reflection and identification of personal goals. Model the process of goal setting. |
| Perception | Display a world map and locate Scandinavia. Built in strategies and supports for prereading (table of contents, make predictions, comment on images, pronunciation guides |  |
| Language & Symbols | The Advance preparation section includes supports for academic vocabulary. As the spelling words are introduced, the teacher writes them on the board and pronounces each word. Students read the words. Introduces vocabulary word “Loki” and explains it is a character in the Norse myths who is a trickster, or one who is full of mischief. Explains homophones – course, coarse. Sidebars with supports for academic vocabulary. |  |
| Comprehension | The Advanced preparation section suggests students keeping a journal/portfolio for daily writing and Locating Stories of Ancient Rome from The Ancient Roman Civilization unit to review myths. Organizes words in a graphic organizer based on sound. Leaves the graphic organizer on display until the assessment for students to refer to during the week |  |
| Physical Action |  | Provide multiple ways for students to respond, compose, or select material. Model the use of assistive technologies and accessibility tools |
| Expression & Communication | Sidebars with supports for English learners, advanced learners, | Allow options for students to communicate through text, speech, drawing, music, comics, dance, video, etc. |
| Executive Functions | The Advanced preparation section suggests students keeping a journal/portfolio for daily writing and Locating Stories of Ancient Rome from The Ancient Roman Civilization unit to review myths. |  |
