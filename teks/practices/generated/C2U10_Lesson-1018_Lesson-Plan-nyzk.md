|  | This lesson can be extended across multiple days to provide students with sufficient time to present their Portfolio Presentations. Currently, students have ten minutes to present their presentations. This can be changed to accommodate class size, time, schedule, etc. Consider adapting elements of TAFE competition rubrics to create a more robust rubric for student presentations.  This lesson describes the audience for these presentations as “peers and invited guests” to align with the TEKS call for “interested stakeholders.” In advance of the presentations, invite those stakeholders (other teachers, school leaders, parents, etc.) to attend and provide feedback. Make enough copies of the portfolio presentation feedback form (in the Student Guide) for each student and guest to complete one form for each presentation they observe. |  |
