## Slide 5

### Scenario: Mrs. K

- It is the first week of a new school year at West Elementary School. Mrs. K, a fifth-grade reading teacher, greets her first period class at the door and instructs them to sit in assigned seats. She introduces herself, goes over the rules and consequences, reviews the expectations for the course, then starts teaching the first full lesson.
- By the end of the week, Mrs. K notices some behavior problems in the class. Jaden frequently interrupts by making jokes and funny noises. Alex talks to the students next to him and sometimes copies their work. Emma has fallen asleep twice and Jasmine is often out of her seat.  The disruptions make it difficult for Mrs. K. to teach and frustrate the rest of the class. She thinks, “My students this year are such behavior problems.” To be continued…

## Slide 7

### Why Learn About Students?

- 7
- Student Surveys. Teachers may use student surveys to learn more about students informally. A more formal and non-evaluative type of survey is a student perception survey, which can be tailored to capture information and feedback directly from students about the way a classroom works and how students are learning in their given environment.
- Non-Academic Conversations. Taking time to listen to students share about their lives is a simple yet effective way to learn more about students to better meet their needs. Engaging in non-academic conversations during lunch time, breaks, class transitions, or during any other moments of downtime during the school day can provide teachers with more insight about students’ lives outside of school.
- Family Relationships. As teachers get to know their students, they also must take time to get to know students’ families. Families can provide greater contextual information about their child, such as why a student has been more tired during class lately or how their child’s favorite sport is soccer. All information coming from families is valuable to teachers to learn more about their students.

## Slide 8

### Exit Ticket

- It is the beginning of the school year and Ms. M has a class full of new students in her third-grade reading class. She asks her students to take a survey so she can get to know what students like and dislike, both in and out of school. She is in the process of conducting home visits to meet families and to get to know what life at home is like for her students. One of her students, Maria, shared in her student survey that she does not read very much  but enjoys being outside. When Ms. M did Maria’s home visit, she noticed that Maria did not have many books at home and the ones she had were all in Spanish. Maria’s parents, who are not fluent English speakers, shared with Ms. M that Maria is an outgoing girl who likes being with her friends
- What did Ms. M. learn about Maria:
- as an individual?
- as a learner?
- as a member of her family?
- What can Ms. M. do to encourage Maria to read more?
