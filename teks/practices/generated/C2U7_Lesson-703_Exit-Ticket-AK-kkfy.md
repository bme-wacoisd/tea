### Lesson 7.03:  Structuring Lessons

Name:
Date:
- What are the 3 key considerations for teachers in implementing high quality instructional materials with structure and intentionality?
Clarity of Student Expectations: Begin with overview/review prior content.  This helps to activate student thinking and make connections between past learning and current learning as well as clarify expectations and student success criteria.
Effective Transitions: Teachers must maximize the time available for learning.  This includes ensuring that transitions between activities are smooth and the teacher structures instructional activities to maximize time on task.
Student Engagement: Students should be actively thinking, reading, writing, and talking about their learning throughout the lesson.

See the example of a double plan below.

- Lesson Description:  Students have just read a passage from the book, The Diary of Anne Frank. The students are examining how the narrator uses figurative language in the text to convey meaning. The teacher wants students to talk to each other about what Anne meant when she said, “I thought my days were numbered.”


- How does this double plan address the 3 key considerations for implementing high quality instructional materials?

- Clarity of Student Expectations:  The teacher provides clear instructions on how students should move and engage in the classroom.  Roles are established for the group work and clear time is provided for each task.

- Effective transitions:  The teacher structure transitions between activities with cues for when everyone has completed them.  Timers are used to make sure transitions are effective.  Identifying a recorder will help to keep the whole group sharing smooth and efficient. All these measures ensure maximum time on task for students.

- Student engagement:  In each step, students are physically responding (finger on phrase in text, raising hands).  Students are given roles in group work to facilitate active participation for each member of the group.

| The teacher will… | The student will… |
| --- | --- |
| Say “You have just read a passage in our text, The Diary of Anne Frank.  Our next task is to examine how the author uses figurative language to convey meaning.  Please identify the phrase ‘I thought my days were numbered’ on page 3, third paragraph down. Put your finger on the phrase so I know you have found it. | Put their finger on the phrase in the text. |
| Say “We will be working in groups of three today.  Please count off by nine around the room.”   Point to the first student to count and give them the number 1.  Continue to point at students as they are counting to indicate the next student. | Students count off by nine to determine their group number. |
| Say “You will now move to your groups.  Notice I have placed the numbers 1-9 around the room”  Point to numbers around the room.  Say “You will have 30 seconds to find your number and group members.  When you get to your groups, raise your hand so I know you are ready.” | Go to assigned number to gather with group members and raise hand when ready. |
| Say “In your groups you will have 10 minutes to discuss what you think Anne Frank meant by ‘I thought my days were numbered.’  Each member of the group has 2 minutes to share their thinking and provide evidence from the text as the other group members listen.  After everyone has a chance to share, come to a consensus about what you think as a group.  Identify someone in each group to serve as a timer to make sure each person has 2 minutes to share, someone to serve as the facilitator and someone who will report out to the whole group. | Identifies a timer, facilitator, and reporter.  Each partner shares for 2 minutes while others listen without responding.  The group comes to consensus on what Anne meant. |
| Set timer for 10 minutes.  Circulate around to make sure students are following the discussion protocol. |  |
