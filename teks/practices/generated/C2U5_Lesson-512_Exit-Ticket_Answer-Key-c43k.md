| Scenario or Assessment | Is this a best practice?) | Why or why not? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mr. Richardson is selecting assessment questions for his final exam from a question bank in his curriculum.  The class has been reading a play.  Mr. Richardson selected some questions that test whether students know the main plot points and characters to assess whether they recall what they read. He also needs them to show they understand some of the deeper meanings of the text so selected some questions to get them to explain the motivation of the some of key characters and cite textual evidence to support their claim. | Yes. | Some questions can focus on basic facts and recall, and some questions should require deeper cognitive engagement. |
| Ms. Jimenez gets the results back from end of quarter assessment and sees that three students failed the test and there is little indication that they have understood the content. They are 11th graders and even though she is tempted to say they need to be accountable for their own learning, she sets up individual meetings with them after school to talk about the results and make a plan to improve their learning.  Additionally, she talks with each student about a future opportunity to retake the test. | Yes. | Ms. Jimenez uses the test results to act for particular students that are struggling by setting up individual meetings.  She also is giving them a chance to retake the test |
| Before students take her mid-year test, Ms. Watson gives students a practice test that has very similar directions and questions.  She gives students time before the practice test to read the directions and ask any questions.  She collects the practice test and notices that some students misunderstood some of the directions and used that information to clarify during the actual mid-year test. | Yes. | She is both giving kids a chance to practice what will be on the test (No surprises) and she is being careful to make sure the directions are clear for students on her mid-year exam. |
| Mr. Whitley decides he will play music while his students take their mid-term exam.  Some of the music that he plays is currently popular and some of the students respond to the music positively when it is played during the test. | No. | While there may be occasions when playing music in class is helpful or appropriate, it is likely not during a higher-stakes test. By the reaction of the students, their attention is clearly divided by the music and not allowing them to focus their attention on the content of the test and doing their best. |
