| How do the Step-by-Step expectations align with the criteria of establishing a routine? | Student answers will vary but may include:  The expectations of the teacher and the students are simple (example: when the teacher says, “Please get to work” students know to pick up their pencils, open their books, and begin working) The document shows both what the students and teacher will be doing when a certain routine is in place. This is an example of double planning. The teacher does not give long instructions, but gives very direct and succinct instructions such as, “Pencils down, hands up.” |

| How do the Step-by-Step expectations align with the criteria of What-to-Do instructions? | Student answers will vary but may include:  The teacher was able to prompt the students through the routine by using specific, clear directions.  The routine is sequential because students know the order in which they are expected to do certain tasks based on the instructions given by the teacher. The teacher can easily observe what the students are doing and can redirect the students if necessary. The students can observe what the teacher and other students are doing to ensure they are on task. |
