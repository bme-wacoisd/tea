High-Quality Instructional Materials
In Texas, high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) are research-based, aligned to the TEKS, differentiated, and reviewed by a team of experts.

A high-quality curriculum is a tool that, when used properly by a well-prepared teacher, can have a significant positive impact on student learning.


The Components of a Curriculum
A curriculum is a sequenced collection of instructional materials such as lesson plans, learning tasks, and assessments. Teachers use it to guide students toward proficiency in content knowledge and skills.

How do teachers know what to teach or what should be in a curriculum?



Standards: The expectations for what students should know and be able to do by the end of each grade level.

Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS): The Texas state learning standards. The TEKS outline what students in Texas should know and be able to do at each grade level.

English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS): These standards outline the instruction that must be provided to allow English language learners the full opportunity to learn English and succeed academically.

Where can you find what students are expected to know and do at the end of each lesson, the lesson objectives? The Student Learning column

How are the objectives aligned with the Unit Essential Question?
In lesson 4 students begin a class model to show how plants and animals survive in a pond environment.
In lesson 7 students explain that animal body parts work together to help the animals survive in a pond environment.
In lesson 10 students describe how a yellowjacket uses its body parts to help it survive.
In lessons 12–16, students apply the engineering design process to create a covering that protects scientists at a pond.
In lesson 19, students analyze information from a modeling activity, videos, and a text to conclude that animals communicate to help themselves and others survive.
