Name:
Date:

Bellringer: Read each of the following practices below used by a teacher.  Based on what you know, rate each as an effective practice or not an effective practice and share your reasoning.


#### Notes: High Leverage Practices



#### Exploration: High Leverage Practices




The following passages about each of the high leverage practices have been excerpted from High Impact Teaching Strategies: Excellence in Teaching and Learning, State of Victoria (Department of Education and Training)- https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/school/teachers/support/high-impact-teaching-strategies.pdf
- Focus on Instructional Outcomes (referred to as “Setting Goals” in the original document)







- Structuring Lessons


- Explicit Teaching







- Worked Examples







- Collaborative Learning








- Multiple Exposures









- Questioning








- Metacognitive Strategies











- Differentiated Instruction (Called “Differentiated Teaching” in the original document)







| Teacher Practice | Is this an effective teaching practice? (Yes/No/Not Sure) | Explain your reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At the beginning of a lesson, at teacher shares lesson objectives. | Yes | Sharing lesson objectives helps students focus on what they must learn. |
| After delivering the lesson, the teacher provides examples and non-examples of the content the students need to learn | Yes | Examples and non-examples help students to better understand a new concept |
| The teacher returns the work one  week after it’s completed. | No | When students are practicing a skill, it is important to receive feedback in a timely manner. |
| The teacher models how to complete a word problem with a clear, step by step explanation | Yes | Yes, demonstrating the steps of a process while explaining the rationale behind the steps is an effective practice. |
| The teacher groups students to discuss the theme of a poem they read in class. | Yes/Maybe | Group learning is an effective practice if it is structured appropriately. |


| High Leverage Teaching Practice | Evidence based practices that reliably increase student learning whenever they are applied. |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence based practice | A practice that is not just based on theory but has been rigorously tested and has shown to make a positive, statistically significant difference in learning outcomes. |


| High Leverage Practice | What is it? /Key Points | How can teachers demonstrate this practice? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focus on Instructional Outcomes | Set & communicate clear goals & success criteria Provide appropriate mix of success and challenge Helps students to understand what is required  Learning goals should provide challenge for students to set high expectations Learning goals should be achievable for varying students & abilities | Access prior knowledge  Set differentiated goals for groups of students based on need Demonstrate a purpose for learning Provide challenging goals and recognize effort toward achieving them |
| Structuring Lessons | Teachers plan lessons which have clear steps & transitions  Reinforce routines and build on learning Optimize time on task and smooth transitions Attend to the sequence to maintain engagement by linking lesson & unit learning | Explains the steps in the lesson (learning goals, new learning, opportunities for practice, questioning techniques and assessment) Make connections between learning goals, activities & assessments Identifies clear transitions between steps in the lesson |
| Explicit Teaching | Clearly show students what to do and how to do it Teacher makes learning intentions clear to students along with success criteria & demonstrates them through modeling Checks for understanding & ties all the concepts together at the end of the lesson | Explains what students need to know and will be able to do at the end of the lesson Shows worked examples to show students how to do something Allows time for student practice Reinforces main points at the end of the lesson |
| Worked Examples | Worked examples are demonstration of the steps required to complete a task By scaffolding the learning, worked examples reduce the cognitive load for students | Scaffolds learning and skills by providing clear, step by step example Designs worked examples accessible to students & unpacks learning Monitors student learning to move toward independent practice |
| Collaborative Learning | Students work together and everyone participates in learning task Uses strategies to establish cooperation and collaboration Relies on students actively participating in roles, responsibilities & outcomes | Sets group tasks & establishes rules about how groups operate Explicitly teaches students to work as team  (roles/responsibilities) Designs tasks that require sharing of expertise & structured participation by all |
| Multiple Exposures | Providing multiple opportunities to encounter, engage with and elaborate on new knowledge Learning developed over time with multiple and spaced interactions with new concepts Distribute practice across several day & vary interactions that learners have w/knowledge | Links multiple exposures to the learning goals Uses variety of learning and assessment tasks that vary interaction with knowledge |
| Questioning | Teachers use questioning for many purposes: to engage students, stimulate thinking and make links to student lives. Provides opportunities for students to talk with each other Can provide feedback to teachers on student understanding | Utilizes protocols for structuring conversations Targets questions/responses to acknowledge individual student needs Engages students in dialogue & pushes their thinking Asks students to justify thinking  Provides feedback & opportunities for students to provide feedback to others |
| Metacognitive Strategies | Thinking about your own thinking Being aware of learning helps to learn better Can help regulate motivation  Can include planning how to approach learning tasks, evaluating progress & monitoring comprehension | Provides students practice setting, monitor & evaluating goals  Helps students use strategies to achieve goals Uses variety of learning & assessment strategies to scaffold and personalize learning |
| Differentiated Instruction | Use methods to extend knowledge & skills of every student in every class regardless of starting point Provides appropriate challenge for all students Responds to student readiness, interests & learning profile Plan lessons that incorporate adjustments to content process and product | Use pre-assessment to determine student readiness, interest & learning profile for needs & strengths Provides realistic & challenging goals & recognize student effort Uses range of strategies to allow students to demonstrate thinking in different ways Assesses student work against prior achievements rather than other students work |
