Bellringer:
Think about a time in your life when you were learning a new skill (such as how to play piano) or were new to a group (such as your first day in a karate class). How did you feel during that time? Did you have anyone who guided you through that process until you felt comfortable on your own?
If yes, how did that person help? If not, why do you think it could have been helpful to have someone to help guide you?
Answers will vary.
Introduction to Mentorship


Creating a Mentee Plan
Use the table below to create your first draft of questions for your mentor teacher. For each category, write two questions that you think it would be important to ask of your mentor teacher as you develop a relationship with them during the Practicum Course.



|  | Mentor Teacher | Mentee Teacher |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | An experienced teacher who provides guidance and support to another teacher through observation, collaboration, and building a trusting relationship. | A teacher who collaborates with another teacher with more experience, who receives guidance and support to better their teaching practice. |
| Who are they? | Usually an experienced teacher (5+ years) Demonstrated an ability to lead others effectively. Good communicators Friendly, but willing to have difficult conversations | Usually, teachers with less experience or experienced teachers who are learning a new skill or teaching an unfamiliar content/grade. Teachers looking for support to better their practice or relationships |
| What is their role? | Listen non-judgmentally but provide feedback. Support instruction through resources, sharing best practices, and observing the mentee. Help the mentee to establish and meet goals. Provide emotional support for the mentee when met with challenging situations at work. Encourage habits that promote a healthy work-life balance | Ask questions and seek guidance when facing a challenge. Listen to feedback with an open mind. Communicate openly about areas of success as well as struggles. Work with the mentor to establish and meet goals. Attempt to implement feedback and have conversations about what works and what does not. Provide data to demonstrate professional and student growth. When necessary, provide documentation or complete paperwork that relates to the mentor/mentee relationship. |

Potential access to new information (ex: newer technologies or practices that they may not be familiar with) An opportunity to foster a positive school culture and climate | Develop relationships with their colleagues.

| When does mentorship occur? | Formal mentorship may be offered to a teacher during their first few years as a teacher, or when they move grade levels, content areas, or schools. Informal mentorship often occurs when colleagues establish trusting relationships from their own interactions. This might be individuals who work in similar content areas, share students, or who collaborate on outside projects (such as academic clubs or sports) | Formal mentorship may be offered to a teacher during their first few years as a teacher, or when they move grade levels, content areas, or schools.

| What are best practices for supporting a mentor/mentee relationship? | Mentors and mentees should foster support by developing a relationship and getting to know the other’s philosophy of education. Common interests are not always necessary for a successful mentor/mentee relationship, but it is helpful to find ways to relate to one another regardless of years’ experience, age, race, gender, etc. Confidentiality rules should be established. Mentors and mentees do not have to be “friends,” but respect and trust should be present for a successful mentorship process. Communication should occur honestly, from both the mentor and mentee. Feedback should be constructive and with best practices for supporting teachers and learners in mind. For formal mentorship, meeting times should be respected and prioritized. If a meeting needs to be rescheduled, for whatever reason, it is important for the mentor and mentee to communicate about their schedule and expectations | Mentors and mentees should foster support by developing a relationship and getting to know the other’s philosophy of education.
