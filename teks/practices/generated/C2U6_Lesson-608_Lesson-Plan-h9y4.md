| Rationale/ Summary | In the Science of Learning unit, we learned that the working memory has limited capacities which can become overwhelmed by tasks that are too cognitively demanding. By providing a step-by-step model of how to perform a task or solve a problem, a teacher helps avoid cognitive overload. In this lesson, students will engage in a role-play activity in which they each will model a section of a lesson, while their peers provide feedback based on the criteria for successful modeling. | In the Science of Learning unit, we learned that the working memory has limited capacities which can become overwhelmed by tasks that are too cognitively demanding.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will reflect on their delivery of instruction to consider how well their model aligned to the success criteria. Students will use a graphic organizer to self-assess their modeling and support their responses with evidence.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Mr. Pope is introducing his 3rd grade students to cause and effect. He shows an educational music video that explains what cause and effect is and provides a few examples. Mr. Pope then places students in pairs, gives each pair a baggie with scenario cards, and asks them to determine the cause and effect in each scenario. As students worked, he walked around the room to check for understanding. He realized that many of the students were having difficulty, so he decided it was best to bring the students back to provide additional instruction and model how to find the cause and effect in one of the scenarios. During the model, Mr. Pope stopped to ask questions to check for student understanding and allowed students to ask questions for clarification. Evaluate Mr. Pope’s instruction based on the success criteria for effective modeling. |  |
| 1 min | T: (Review correct responses.)  T: How well did Mr. Pope meet the success criteria for effective modeling? S: Mr. Pope did not model how to find the cause and effect in a scenario at the beginning. Once he realized students were struggling, he brought students back to model. Mr. Pope checked for understanding while groups worked and realized students were struggling, so he brought students back together to provide additional instruction and model an example. Mr. Pope could have slowed the pace of the lesson to allow time to model how to find the cause and effect prior to the activity. During the model after the activity, Mr. Pope provided time for students to ask questions for clarification. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Review Success Criteria  T: Let’s review the criteria for successful modeling. When modeling a concept or skill, a teacher must:  Break down the skill into learnable steps. Visually demonstrate the steps as students watch. Think Aloud = Verbally explain what the student is seeing as you model Make important connections between the steps. Check for student understanding along the way and re-model steps, as necessary. Ensure pacing is just the right speed. Allow opportunities for students to ask questions and get clarification.   T: It is also important to note that the modeling must align to the language and rigor of the objective to ensure students are focused on the most important content expected for the lesson and the content that will be assessed in the future. Therefore, it is essential that the objective align to the standards for the grade-level. | Student Guide PPT |
| 25 mins | Practice – Role-play  T: In groups of three, you are going to role-play a portion of Lesson 2 from the Grade K Skills 1 Unit, pages 21-26. (Provide students with a copy of the lesson plan. Divide students into groups of 3).  T: Each group member will choose a section from the lesson plan to model for the group. You will have 5 minutes to read through your section and plan out your delivery. While the “teacher” is modeling the lesson, the other group members will provide feedback on how well the teacher model aligns to the success criteria. At the end of each model, group members will have 2 minutes to share feedback.  T: Here are the sections you can choose to role-play:  Listening to Environment Noises Left/Right Discrimination Finger/Hand Awareness Draw Vertical Lines on a Vertical Surface  S: (Move into groups and assign sections. Complete role-play activity and record feedback in the student guide.) | Student Guide Lesson 2 from the Grade K Skills 1 Unit, pages 21-26 |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: How did it feel to model?  S: (Student responses will vary.)  T: As the “students,” what was helpful about the modeling?  S: The model broke down the skill into learnable steps. The teacher implemented think aloud to verbally explain what we were seeing as they modeled. There was a check for understanding to make sure we were on track with our learning. The model was quick.   T: How does modeling help build student understanding?  S: Teacher modeling helps build student understanding by scaffolding the concepts and skills into learnable steps. Modeling allows students to see how to perform each step of a process as well as understand the connections between each step and why each step is important. Modeling also communicates what a successful outcome looks like, and the importance of the concept being taught. |  |
