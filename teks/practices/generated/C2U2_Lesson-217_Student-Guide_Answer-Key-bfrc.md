Think of a time when a teacher recognized you for doing the right thing in class. How did your teacher’s response to your efforts impact your motivation and performance?

Answers will vary.



Intro to Radar – Be Seen Looking
As you watch “Be Seen Looking: Doug Lemov and Jabali Sawicki,” respond to the following questions:
- How can you balance seeing behaviors that meet expectation vs those that do not?

- Use subtle messages, such as head nods, gestures, etc. to show students that you see them.


- Why is it important to notice the students who are working hard and meeting expectations for behavior?
Students want to know that you see the good they are doing; by reinforcing the good, students will want to keep doing it; builds positive relationships with students.

- How does it impact the classroom to notice behaviors that do not meet expectations?

- Students are less likely to misbehave and there is less peer pressure to misbehave because students know the teacher will catch them.

- When should teachers be seen looking?

All the time, especially when they are working one-on-one with a student or small group of students; the rest of the class needs to know the teacher is still aware of the whole class.

Practice 2: Analyze Be Seen Looking in Action
As you watch the series of videos, note the ways each teacher intentionally scans. Pay close attention to the different Be Seen Looking Dance Moves.



| Dance Move | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Invisible Column | Give directions Move head slightly side-to-side as if you are looking around a column. |
| Tip Toes | Give directions.  Stand on your tiptoes and look out at the room.  Imagine you are looking at a hard-to-see spot. |
| Disco Finger | Give directions.  Tract the track of your gaze in a swivel with one finger pointing to make your swivel obvious.  Imagine thinking, “Let me just check all of these places.” |
| The Sprinkler | Give directions.  Start your swivel across the room with pointed finger.  Snap back a few degrees in the direction you just scanned as if you say, “Oh, I think I just saw something I shouldn’t ha... No. Everything is okay.” |
| The Politician | Give directions.  Point in recognition to students following directions: one over here, one over there. |
| The Quarterback | Give directions.  Crouch and scan.  If you are crouching to confer with one student, use this technique to ensure students across the room see you looking. |
