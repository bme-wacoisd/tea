What are the characteristics of effective assessment? (Record your responses in the graphic organizer below.)
Review the objective and assessment provided. Evaluate and provide suggestions for improvement based on the characteristics of effective instruction. (Record your responses in the graphic organizer below.)

About halfway through a lesson about the characteristics of living things, Mr. Johnson wants to know if his students can differentiate between living and non-living things based on a taught definition before they begin to develop a list of characteristics of living things. If they can, he will move into the next part of the lesson during which students will compare several living things to find their similarities and develop a list of characteristics based on those similarities.
To determine whether students are ready to move on, Mr. Johnson provides each student a handout with images of living things and non-living things. The images are new images, not images reviewed in class. He asks them to circle the living things and put an X over non-living things. At the bottom, he includes a bonus question: Name three characteristics of living things. Then, because Mr. Johnson wants students to do their best so that he gets good data, he tells them that this activity will count as a quiz and the bonus question is extra credit.


Objective: Students will be able to develop a list of characteristics of living things



#### Think Aloud and Practice 1


Objective: Recognize the value of coins and count up to find their total value.

#### Practice 2: Non-example


Ms. Vallejo is teaching a lesson to her 2nd grade class about different strategies to make $1 or make change from $1. Read the scenario below. Identify the formative assessments she uses and then explain why they are problematic and what Ms. Vallejo might do instead for a better assessment.

Ms. Vallejo begins class by reminding her students that in the previous lesson, they learned how to identify a set of coins that added up to $1. She asks her students to give her a thumbs up if they remembered the lesson. Most of Ms. Vallejo’s students give a thumbs up, so she decides to move to the next part of the lesson – how to make $1 or make change from $1 using different strategies.
To introduce the lesson, Ms. Vallejo engages her students in a discussion about making change. She asks students if they have ever seen anyone make change before. She asks them where people might need to make change. She guides students to identify places including restaurants, grocery stores, and other stores like Walmart and Target.
Next, Ms. Vallejo hides some coins in her hand. She gives a student some coins and asks the student to coin the total amount of her coins. The student counts total amount and says she has 17c. The teacher then models for the students how to determine how much is hiding in her hand by telling the students that the amount in her hand added to the 17c the student has makes $1. She explains that one part is hiding, and one part is known. Together, the two parts make a whole that equals $1. She models how to write a number sentence on the board and then models how to solve the number sentence. She guides the students through two more examples and then tells them that they are going to practice counting the total value of coins on their own using a practice worksheet.
After students work on their own, Ms. Vallejo reviews the answers, responds to questions, and provides feedback. Then, she tells students that they are going to complete an exit ticket. The exit ticket asks students to answer word problems to find amount needed to make $1 based on various known amounts.
