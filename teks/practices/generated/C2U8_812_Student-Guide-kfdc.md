Lesson 8.12: Multiple Means of Action & Expression | Expression & Communication
Name:
Date:
Bellringer: Ms. C. just finished a lesson on insects and assigns students a brochure to show what they learned. The brochure must include information and pictures. One student in the class struggles with writing and although she learned a great deal about insects and can elaborately explain her learning, her teacher thinks she has a lack of knowledge and didn’t master the task because she struggled to create her brochure. What are some other ways the teacher might find out what this student knows about insects?

Intro to Expression & Communication

Practice 1 - Scenario Analysis
Consider to two scenarios below to determine which is the best example of applying expression and communication.
Example 1: Mrs. D. spent the week teaching her students about frogs and the life cycle of a frog. To demonstrate their understanding, she gives students a worksheet where they must label the steps of the life cycle and write at least 3 sentences about a frog. She then provides students with materials to make a model of the life cycle of a frog.
Example 2: Mr. H. also spent the week teaching his students about frogs and the life cycle of a frog. To demonstrate their understanding, Mr. H. gives his students a choice board where they must choose how they want to demonstrate their learning about frogs and their life cycle. Some of the choices include making a video, creating a visual representation, writing a paragraph, podcast series, etc. Mr. H. provides students with a rubric that indicates the key components of a frog life cycle that students must demonstrate in their products.

Practice 2 – Demonstrate Your Understanding
