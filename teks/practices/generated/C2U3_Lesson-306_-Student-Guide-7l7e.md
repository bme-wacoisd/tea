Bellringer:
In the last lesson we were introduced to the idea of asset-based and deficit-based teaching.  Define each idea and describe why asset-based thinking about students can help student learning.

High Expectations: Examples and Non-Examples





High Expectations: Independent Practice
In the scenarios below, determine if the teacher is holding high expectations for all students and explain why they are or are not.

Scenario A:  A teacher requires that all her students correct every math problem they got wrong on a quiz, explain their mistakes or misunderstanding, and turn that in as an assignment after the quiz.






Scenario B:  A teacher praises a set of students who always get “A”s on their essays because they are “naturally gifted writers”, while saying nothing about the students who are not yet writing excellent essays.






Scenario C:  A teacher praises a set of students who always get “A”s on their essays and describes the elements that make their essays strong, and she describes for all students what they can to do to make their essays meet the standards. She indicates that by the end of the year, all students who apply these skills can be writing excellent essays.









| Teacher Action | Example or Non-Example? | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A teacher says, “I am so proud of you class. When we started this unit, we had a hard time with fractions, but we worked hard, did lots of problems, and we now are getting really good at this!” |  |  |
| (When a student tries but gets the wrong answer)  That is a good try – even though that isn’t exactly right – you will get it with more practice! Now let’s think about why that isn’t correct… |  |  |
| (When a student gets the right answer)  Great job! You are so smart! |  |  |
| (When a student gets the right answer)  That is correct!  I appreciate all the time and work you’ve put in to learning this!  Can you explain how you got that answer? |  |  |
| A teacher asks students to explain how they improved their essay from their first draft to their final version and how they used feedback to make changes. |  |  |
| A student says, “I am just no good at math!”  The teacher says, “That’s okay. Some people are naturally good at math, and some aren’t. I am not really a math person myself.” |  |  |
| A student says, “I am just no good at math!”  The teacher says, “I understand you are frustrated. That is part of the process. You just don’t understand this yet. Now, let’s look the problem…” |  |  |
| The teacher uses a tracking tool in the classroom that shows how students master topics over time – moving from not knowing to knowing. |  |  |
| After a student is called on and doesn’t immediately know the right answer, the teacher uses questioning in the classroom to help the student go from a misunderstanding to an understanding of the content. |  |  |
| A teacher calls on a student. When the student doesn’t know they right answer immediately, the teacher moves on to another student right away. |  |  |
| A teacher requires students to return to their quizzes and correct the answer they got wrong and explain their reasoning. |  |  |
| A teacher puts a “C” grade at the top of the essay with no indication how it could be improved. |  |  |
| A teacher puts a “C” grade at the top of the essay and uses a red pen to mark up places where the essay could be strengthened and improved with specific changes. |  |  |
