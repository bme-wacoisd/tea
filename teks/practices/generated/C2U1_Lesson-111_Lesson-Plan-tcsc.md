| Rationale/ Summary | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom. This lesson is the third in a series of six focused on the introduction of systems and routines. For systems and routines to work, teachers must get student buy-in. One way to increase student buy-in is to help students own the systems and routines. Careful attention to the roll-out of a routine or system can increase student ownership. In this lesson, students consider the importance of deliberate practice in developing student understanding, and ownership, of routines. Students will discuss the keys to effective practice of routines and how these characteristics contribute to the effective roll-out of the routines. | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom.

|  | Prepare to share the video Deliberate Practice: Nikki Bowen. |  |
|  | Prepare for each student to read Vision of Success – Reading Transition. Students may receive paper copies of the reading or access it online. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Describe a time you were committed to and planned for something but didn’t follow through. Think, for example, of a New Year’s resolution or another time you set a goal but then didn’t complete it. What might have impacted your lack of follow-through? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Bellringer Review T: Please raise your hand if you were able to answer the bellringer without too much thought.  S: (Raise hands.)  T: Most people have had experiences in which they plan to do something and then don’t complete their goal. Can I have some volunteers share how they responded to the bellringer?  S: (Share responses.)  T: What are some of the reasons why people don’t follow through with goals they set?  S: Responses will vary but may include:  They can’t get used to doing something on a regular schedule. They run into a problem, and they don’t know what to do. No one encourages them.  S: The reasons you just listed also apply to classroom routines. They are some of the key reasons why classroom routines don’t become practices that students do without even thinking about it. Today, we’re going to learn about how to engage students in deliberate practice of a routine. Doing so increases the likelihood of the routines being completed effectively by all students. | Student Guide  Video: Nikki Bowen |
| 15 mins | Video and Discussion: Effective Practice of Routines  T: We’re going to begin by watching a video of how a teacher named Ms. Bowen helped her students practice a routine for how they transition while reading. As you watch the video, take notes in the viewing guide in your Student Guide. Write down what the teacher does to help the students learn and practice the routine.   T: (Play video.)  S: (Take notes in viewing guide in Student Guide.)  T: Can I have some volunteers share what they noticed about how Ms. Bowen and her class practice the routine?  S: Responses may vary but may include: She gave clear observable directions. She modeled what she wanted them to do. She broke up the routine into smaller pieces to explain, model, and practice it. She celebrated success. She highlighted students who were doing the right thing. She made corrections. | Student Guide Video |
| 10 mins | Notes: Keys to Effective Practice of Routines  T: This video is a great example of the effective practice of a routine. When this teacher planned this practice, she used some specific keys to effective practice. Let’s review them together. Add notes to your Student Guide as we discuss.  T: The first key is to model and describe. We’ve talked about this before. What does it mean to model and describe a routine for students?  S: The teacher shows the students what to do and describes how to do it.  T: The second key is to pre-empt pitfalls. Pre-empting something means taking action to prevent it from happening. Applied to the classroom, it means a teacher thinks ahead of time about what will be difficult for students and plans for students to practice those parts.  T: The third key is to isolate the step. It’s helpful when students practice the routine in small steps at first instead of trying to practice a multi-step routine all at once.  T: The fourth key is to scan and give feedback. A teacher is scanning the classroom when they examine the room point-by-point by moving the eyes to observe all students. As they scan, they can give feedback. If they highlight examples of students doing the routine correctly, they can reinforce the routine, which is an action that strengthens the response.  S: (Add notes to chart in Student Guide.)  T: When all four keys are used to help students practice a routine, teachers anticipate student confusion, and students practice strategically simplified steps that prevent the confusion from taking hold. As a result, they are more likely to succeed in completing the routine. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Independent Reading T: You will now independently read Ms. Bowen’s double-plan for practicing the reading routine with her students. As you read, answer the two reflection questions in your Student Guide. You will have ten minutes to read the plan and answer the questions. Begin.  T: (Set 10-minute timer.)  S: (Read plan and respond to questions in Student Guide.) | Student Guide Reading |
| 5 mins | Practice 2: Paired Discussion on Reading T: Now that you’ve had a chance to read and reflect independently, you’re going to get into pairs and share your thoughts with a partner. If you hear a good idea, add it to your Student Guide. You will have 5 minutes to share with a partner. Stand Up-Hand Up-Pair Up!  S: (Complete Stand Up-Hand Up-Pair Up routine to identify partner and share responses to reflection questions.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 3: Whole-Group Discussion on Reading T: As a class, we’re now going to discuss a different reflection question. How did Ms. Brown prepare for deliberate practice, and what made her plan successful?  S: Responses may vary but may include: She broke the process into small steps and double-planned for each step. She considered elements of the routine that might pose a challenge for students and planned for how to practice these elements. She planned to practice each step of the routine. She modeled the steps. She provided feedback to students. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Can I have a volunteer share the four keys to effective practice of routines?  S: Teachers model and describe, pre-empt pitfalls, isolate the step, and scan and give feedback.  T: What is the result when teachers use these four keys to plan their practice with students?  S: Teachers anticipate student confusion, and students practice strategically simplified steps that prevent the confusion from taking hold. As a result, they are more likely to succeed in completing the routine. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
