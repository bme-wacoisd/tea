How does formal feedback differ from informal feedback? What are the benefits of formal written feedback over informal verbal feedback?
Formal feedback is given at the completion of a task to assess progress against learning objectives. It is scheduled into the learning process and provided systematically for all students. Formal feedback should be given at the completion of a task where informal is given during a task to keep the learning progressing. The benefit to written feedback is that it is recorded for students to go back to, and it is given to all students, not just some.
