## Unit 9: Feedback

### Lesson 9.07: Utilizing Peer Feedback to Improve Student Learning






Strategy Description Cards

Strategy: Gallery Walk for Feedback
In a gallery walk, several pieces of work are displayed in stations around the room. Students circulate around the room to provide feedback on each piece of work. The feedback can be placed on sticky notes by students or written on a piece of paper next to the work. Generally, the feedback is anonymous. Success criteria for the task is reviewed with the class, along with how to give effective feedback prior to beginning the gallery walk. Sentence starters could be provided as a scaffold to support effective feedback. The amount of time required depends on the number of stations, but generally providing about 3 minutes at each station is a good rule of thumb for a student to review the work and provide effective feedback.


Strategy 2: Charette Protocol
Charette protocol is a highly structured way to provide feedback on a piece of work that is in progress. In the protocol, a student presents a work in progress verbally to a small group of students (usually about three) who will provide feedback. After sharing the work, the presenter will also share a question that they have about their work which will guide the focus of the feedback provided. The protocol would follow the steps shown below:
- Presenter shares work and focus question for feedback to the group. (5 minutes)
- Group asks clarifying questions about the work. (2 minutes)
- Presenter turns around and takes notes while the group discusses the work. The group will generate feedback on where the work is strong as well as suggestions for improvement. During this time, the presenter does not respond to any feedback or comments made by the group. (5 minutes)
- The presenter shares a summary of the feedback that they heard from the group and ideas that were most helpful for improving their work. (3 minutes)
Prior to allowing students to engage in the charette protocol teachers should model the protocol as an example for the entire class and review how to provide effective feedback. Sentence stems and a handout of the protocol steps could be utilized as scaffolds for the protocol. Because each round takes at least 15 minutes for each presenter, if you have a group of four students this protocol could take upwards of an hour or more.




Strategy 3: Two Stars and a Wish
This strategy involves students reviewing the work of a peer and provided feedback to identify two elements of the work that they like (Stars) and to identify one element of the work that might need revision (Wish). Students will work with a partner or small group for the feedback session.  Students trade their assignments and review their work. Once the student reviews the peers work, they take turns sharing their feedback with a peer while the peer stays silent. Once the feedback has been shared, the peer can respond to the feedback by sharing what they will change based on the feedback received. Working in small groups this process could take less than 20-30 minutes to complete.
Prior to conducting the feedback sessions, the teacher should model an example of the using a sample piece of work. For younger students, this may need to be modeled more than once. During the model session the teacher can review the success criteria for the task as well as how to provide effective feedback. Sentence starters such as “I would like to give you a star for _____ because I think you did _________ really well” or “I wish next time that you would ______ because ______” could be included on a handout to support the feedback process for students.

Scenarios for PPT
Scenario 1:  Mr. Olivera is working with his 2nd grade students on their opinion writing. Students have been asked to write a short paragraph describing whether they prefer dogs or cats as a pet. Each student has completed an opinion paragraph supporting their claim with at least three details and the paragraph contains 3-5 sentences. The students also included a picture with their work that illustrates some part of their paragraph. Now that students have completed their task, he wants the students to receive some feedback on their work from peers. He only has about 30 minutes to dedicate to the process in his classroom but feels it is important for the students to hear from at least a few peers.
Scenario 2:  The students in Mrs. Greaves 8th grade social studies class have been learning about the New England Colonies and the foundations of representative government in the United States. In groups of three, the students were tasked with creating a front page of a newspaper from colonial times that highlighted articles about life as a colonist as well as key events during that period. Students worked to create their newspaper page on a large poster, creating a creative name and including images that enhance and support the information shared in their articles. Mrs. Greaves wants the groups to get feedback from everyone in the class on their work but only has about a half of class period to dedicate to the feedback process.
Scenario 3: Mr. Johannsson is teaching a level II art class at the local high school. His students are exploring artistic styles from a variety of historical periods and cultures. He has tasked his students to choose a time and culture and create an original work of art that demonstrates the specific characteristics of representative artwork from that time and culture. The students have completed a draft plan for the piece of work outlining some of the materials and key characteristics to include. They have also completed a sketch of the potential work. Mr. Johannsson thought it would be helpful for the students to get some feedback from peers before beginning work on the final piece. Because this piece is an important part of the student’s grade for the quarter, he is willing to dedicate a full 90-minute class as for feedback to allow students the opportunities to think about revisions before they start working on the final piece the following week.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Scenario Students in Mrs. Blanchard’s middle school science class have worked on developing science experiments to investigate density. The students had to design an experiment to determine the density of different objects, conduct the experiment to collect data and then present the experiment, data, and findings on a poster to present to their classmates. Mrs. Blanchard wants all the students to have a chance to explore and provide feedback on each of the experiment posters. She has dedicated about twenty minutes of class time to allow for students to provide feedback.   Which of the peer feedback strategies that we have discussed would be most appropriate to use for this application? (TAG, Gallery Walk, Glow and Grows, Charette Protocol)  Which of the key considerations impacted your decision to select this strategy and why?

|  | In this lesson students will be introduced to three peer feedback strategies. The strategies are provided on cards below the lesson plan. This lesson is designed to have students rotate to a card to collect the information. Depending on the number of students you have, you might consider setting up multiple rotations in the classroom to prevent too many students at one station at a time. In the second part of the Practice: Exploring Peer Feedback Strategies scenarios are provided on the ppt slide deck for students to consider in groups. If you do not have access to the ppt or it is hard for students to read/see in the classroom, you might consider printing the scenarios found at the bottom of this lesson and providing them to each group of students to read. |  |
| 2 mins | Bellringer Below are some examples of sentence starters that could be used to support peer feedback. How can sentence starters help teachers to scaffold or structure effective feedback? The best part of your work is…because… To make your work stronger I would suggest…. I am wondering… | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Review T: In the previous lesson you were introduced to a strategy for peer feedback called “TAG.” Can anyone remember what TAG stood for? S: Share something you like, Ask Thoughtful Questions, Give Positive Suggestions. T: Here is the handout that I used in my model to teach students how to provide effective feedback. You might notice that there are sentence starters below each of the sections of TAG. Why did I provide sentence starters?  S: Sometimes it is hard to think of feedback. It can help students to get started.  T:  How do you think they support students to give effective feedback? S: They prompt students to provide specific and clear feedback.  T:   Today we will explore more about structure and how it impacts the strategy chosen for peer feedback. | PPT |
| 10 mins | Peer Feedback Strategies T: Locate the Peer Feedback Strategies section on your student guide.  S: (Locate Peer Feedback Strategies section on Student Guide.) T: In the previous lesson we discussed that peer feedback is a practice where feedback is given from one student to another. Can you remember reasons why this can be a powerful practice? S: It can help students to understand the task better, allows them to learn from one another and sometimes students take feedback better from their peers than teachers. T: Peer feedback requires structure, practice, and planning. You need to explicitly teach what effective feedback looks like. T: There are many different peer feedback strategies that teachers can use to structure peer feedback. When deciding what strategy to use in the classroom teachers should consider: Age group of the students Amount of time required to provide effective feedback. Type of feedback (small part of work vs whole work) How much feedback (Feedback from many students or just one/two) At what stage of the work is the strategy best utilized? (Before draft is completed, after a completed draft) Scaffolds to support effective feedback. | PPT Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Model: Peer Feedback Strategies T: For instance, let us look at the TAG strategy we used yesterday. Based on what you know, do you think it would be good for younger students? Middle? High? S: That strategy could be utilized for all grade levels.  T: Yes. It is a simple to remember process that can be understood by all grade level students. What about the amount of time it would require? S: It would not take long to give that kind of feedback. We practiced it in 5-10 minutes yesterday. T: Right, this strategy allows for quick feedback and does not require a lot of time in the classroom. What about the type of feedback? Would it work for a big piece of work, or would it be better for a smaller part of work? S: Because it does not take that long, it probably would be best for a smaller piece of work. T: It probably is best for smaller works but could be altered to provide feedback on a larger project as well. Yesterday we only asked for 2 tells, 2 asks and 2 gives. On a larger piece of work, I might expect more of a focus for the feedback. How much feedback would you get from this strategy? Would you get it from a lot of students or just a few? S: Probably just a few. The way we used it yesterday only one person gave feedback. T: At what stage of the work would this strategy best support learning? Earlier in the process, after a completed draft? S: We used it yesterday after a completed draft to provide input on improving future drafts. T: What scaffolds did we discuss that supported effective feedback? S: The sentence starters under each category helped to guide the feedback and we gave a copy of the TAG strategy as handout to keep students on track. | PPT Student Guide |
| 25 mins | Practice: Peer Feedback Strategies  T: We are going to explore three additional peer feedback strategies. You will work with a group of three to assess the strategy based on the key considerations first. After exploring each strategy, you will be provided scenarios and determine which of the strategies best fit based on the key considerations. (Arrange students in groups of three.)  S: (Move to groups of three.)  T: There are three strategies that we will explore today. I have placed strategy cards at stations around the room. As a group you will move to a station. You will have 4 minutes to discuss the strategy with your group and complete the chart for the strategy in the Practice: Peer Feedback Strategies section of your student guide. Please locate the first chart in the practice section of your student guide now.   S: (Locate chart in practice portion of student guide.)  T: I will keep time and tell you when to rotate to your next station. What questions do you have for me?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: (Direct students to first station. Set timer for 4 minutes.)  S: (Move to station 1 and discuss strategy with group and complete strategy chart on student guide.)  T: Time is up. You may rotate to your next station. (Continue to time each station and provide direction to rotate to students until all three stations are complete.)  T: Now we are going to look at some classroom scenarios where teachers might use peer feedback. As I display each scenario you will have two minutes to discuss with your group which of the three strategies would be the best to use based on the key considerations we have discussed. Briefly describe which considerations you used and why when making your decision by recording your answer in your student guide. Any questions?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: Here is your first scenario. You have two minutes to discuss. (Display scenario 1 on PPT and set timer for 2 minutes.)  S: (Discuss scenario 1.)  T: Which strategy did you decide was the best fit? Why?  S: Two stars and a wish are the best fit. It involves younger elementary students, and the teacher has a limited amount of time. He only wants feedback to come from a few peers on a whole piece of work.  T: Did everyone get the same answer?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Great. Here is your second scenario. You have two minutes to discuss. (Display scenario 2 on PPT and set timer for 2 minutes.)  S: (Discuss scenario 2.)  T: Which strategy did you decide was the best fit? Why?  S: Gallery walk is the best fit. It involves middle school level students and a limited amount of time for feedback. The teacher wants all students to be able to provide some feedback on every project.   T: Did everyone get the same answer?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Great. Here is your third scenario. You have two minutes to discuss. (Display scenario 3 on PPT and set timer for 2 minutes.)  S: (Discuss scenario 3.)  T: Which strategy did you decide was the best fit? Why?  S: Charette Protocol is the best fit. The students need feedback on a work in progress. The teacher has a 90-minute period to dedicate to feedback and the students are older (HS level).   T: Did everyone get the same answer?  S: (Answers will vary.) | PPT   Strategy Cards Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: Today we explored several different peer feedback strategies that could be utilized in the classroom. What are some of the key considerations that we used to determine which to use?  S: Age group of students, amount of time required, type of feedback and stage of work as well as scaffolds that would be needed to support effective feedback.  T: What were some examples of scaffolds that could be used to support effective feedback?  S: Sentence starters, modeling the process, handouts with the protocols on them, reviewing success criteria for the task, and reviewing what effective feedback looks like. |  |
