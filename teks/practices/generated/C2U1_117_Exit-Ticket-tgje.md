### Lesson 1.17: Do It Again

Name:
Date:
Read the following scenario. Determine how Mrs. M could use the Do It Again technique to set a standard of excellence.
Students in Mrs. M’s class are working in groups to discuss how the environment impacts plant growth. One routine that has been established in her classroom is the “1, 2, 3, Eyes on me” technique. When Mrs. M says this phrase, students are to immediately stop what they are doing, put their materials down, and at look at the teacher.
Mrs. M is now ready for students to come back together for a group discussion, so she says “1, 2, 3, eyes on me!” Most of the students immediately stop what they are doing and look at Mrs. M, but there are still a handful of students who are still putting their pencils down and slowing turning to look at the teacher.
How should Mrs. M proceed?
