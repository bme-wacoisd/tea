| Rationale/ Summary | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom. This lesson is the first in a series of six focused on the introduction of systems and routines. For systems and routines to work, teachers must get student buy-in. One way to increase student buy-in is to help students own the systems and routines. Careful attention to the roll-out of a routine or system can increase student ownership. In this lesson, students learn strategies for increasing student ownership of systems and routines, with a focus on roll-out speeches. They also identify characteristics of effective roll-out speeches. | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Describe the best strategy that a teacher can use to increase student ownership of systems and routines. Review the roll-out speech below. Complete the chart that follows the speech. Today is the first time that we’re going to do a lab experiment. You are going to become the scientists and test out the things we’ve been learning in class. It’s not about what you read in the textbook anymore; it’s about what you prove yourself through experiments. If you’re interested in going into a science career, today is even more exciting. Experiments are how scientists discover new knowledge. In the lab, safety is incredibly important. Because these are real experiments, we need to be cautious and follow strict safety protocols. First, we’re going to focus on the routine we will use to get ready for lab. As I call your row, you’ll first head to the cabinet and pick up a pair of gloves. Don’t put them on just yet! You’ll then walk to the cabinet and get your lab coat.  Just hold on to it. You’ll then stop at the station on the counter and pick up a pair of safety goggles. You will then go to your assigned lab station and put on the goggles, gloves, and lab coat. Once you’ve put on all three, raise your hand in the air. When I see everyone with a hand in the air, I’ll know that you’re ready to begin the experiment.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Describe a time when you were told by a parent or a teacher to do something, but no one told you why you needed to do it. What was your response? How did the situation feel? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Discussion and Notes: Student Ownership in Systems and Routines T: Put your bellringer aside. We will return to it in a few moments.  S: (Set aside bellringer.)  T: Today, we’re going to begin class with a new vocabulary term. Student ownership is the term for when students support and want an idea or process in the classroom to be successful.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Student ownership doesn’t just happen on its own. Think back to how you answered the bellringer. In that situation, did you feel ownership over the task you were asked to complete?  S: Responses may vary but may include: No because I didn’t understand why I was doing it. No because no one explained to me why it was important.  T: Because no one explained why they were asking you to complete that task, you couldn’t feel ownership of it.  When someone explains why the task is important, and you see how it connects to your goals, you experience buy-in. Buy-in is when you accept an idea or process and want to put it into practice.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Is it important to you that everyone feels safe in our classroom?  S: Yes  T: You have ownership over that goal. We all want everyone to feel safe in our space.  T: If I tell you our routine for classroom discussion, do you feel strongly about putting it into practice?  S: Not really  T: What if I explain that we have that routine so that all students feel safe sharing their thoughts in our classroom?  S: Now I see why it’s important, and I’ll be careful to follow the routine.  T: Knowing “the why” enables you to have greater buy-in.  T: Can I have a volunteer provide an example of when you felt ownership of and buy-in for a routine in another class? Why did you feel that way?  S: Responses may vary but may include: There are specific ways we must get our supplies in art class. If we don’t follow the routine, we can ruin our clothes by getting stuff all over them. We have a routine in Spanish class for how we take turns speaking. Speaking is a part of your grade for that class. We need to follow the routine so that everyone has a chance to do well for that part of their grade.  T: Teachers can increase student ownership and buy-in when they introduce a new routine through a roll-out speech. A roll-out speech is a public explanation of an element of a classroom and its importance to the classroom culture.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: There are two important characteristics of an effective roll-out speech. We’ve already been discussing one of them. What do you think it is?  S: Explaining why the routine or system is important.  T: Add that to your Student Guide.  S: (Add to chart in Student Guide.)  T: The second characteristic is modeling and describing during the roll-out speech. Students should hear the teacher describing the routine or system while they show what it looks like to do it well.  S: (Add to chart in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Independent Practice: Identifying Characteristics of Effective Roll-Out Speeches T: I’m going to show a video with a narrator speaking about a video of a teacher doing a roll-out speech with their class. We’re going to look for two characteristics of an effective roll-out speech, so you’re going to work in pairs, with one person focusing on each characteristic.  Let’s use our Turn and Talk routine to find a partner near your seat.  S: (Use Turn and Talk routine to identify partner.)  T: One of you will watch for how the teacher explains the why. The other will watch for how the teacher describes and models. Take one minute to determine who will watch for each characteristic.  S: (Determine which partner will focus on each to the two characteristics.)  T: As you watch the video, take notes in your column in the Student Guide.  T: (Play video.)  S: (Take notes in Student Guide.)  T: There’s a lot happening in that video, so I’m going to play it again. Add things you missed the first time to your Student Guide.  T: (Play video.)  S: (Take notes in Student Guide.) | Student Guide Video Roll-Out-Eric Snider |
| 10 mins | Partner Share: Identifying Characteristics of Effective Roll-Out Speeches T: Now, you’ll each share what you saw with your partner. First, the partner who took notes on how the teacher shared the why will share. The other member of the pair should fill out the column in the Student Guide with what your partner saw. You have four minutes to share.  S: (First partner shares what they observed while second partner adds to Student Guide.)  T: Switch roles. The partner who took notes on how the teacher described and modeled the routine will share. If you shared first, it’s now your turn to add to your Student Guide.  S: (Second partner shares what they observed while first partner adds to Student Guide.)  S: Responses may vary but may include: How did the teacher share the why? Students learn the most when they talk to each other, especially when they disagree. Listening to people you disagree with and having discussions is a skill important in high school, college, and life. How did the teacher describe and model? He used two students as examples to explain how he would ask one to build off the other’s analysis. He shows the students how they need to make eye contact with their peers. He also has a student model how to address her peers. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: How can teachers increase student ownership of systems and routines?  S: By helping students understand why they do those things.  T: What is a specific step that a teacher can take to increase ownership?  S: They can develop and deliver a roll-out speech.  T: What are the two important characteristics of a roll-out speech?  S: Teachers need to explain why a routine or systems is important and model how it is completed. | Student Guide |
