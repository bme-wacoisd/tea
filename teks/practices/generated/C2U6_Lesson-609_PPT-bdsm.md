## Slide 8

### Exit Ticket

- Review the scenario below to determine whether it meets the characteristics of effective modeling. If the criteria are not met, provide a suggestion for improvement.
- A 1st grade teacher is teaching her students how to solve addition problems by making a bar model. The teacher introduces the following word problem:
- Tom has 5 books in a box. He puts 3 more books in the box. How many books are in the box?
- The teacher does a think aloud for the following question: What do we need to find? She explains that we need to find how many books are in the box. She then asks students to think about what information from the word problem they need to use. The teacher underlines important information in the word problem, such as 5 books and 3 more books. The teacher then draws a bar model to show students how to put the information they found in the word problem into a bar model. Last, the teacher wrote the equation 5 + 3 = 8.
- How does teacher modeling help build student understanding and mastery of the standard?
