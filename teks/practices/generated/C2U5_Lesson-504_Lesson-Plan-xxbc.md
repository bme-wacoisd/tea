| Rationale/ Summary | Formative assessments – including informal formative assessments – help a teacher plan for and deliver effective instruction. Knowing a variety of informal formative assessments as well as when and how to use them will support students in planning for and using informal formative assessments with intention. | Formative assessments – including informal formative assessments – help a teacher plan for and deliver effective instruction.

| Vocabulary | Formal Assessment | Formal Assessment | Structured instructional activities within the lesson in which students and teachers assess the progress of student’s learning to help in the learning process (practice sets, homework, fluency assessment) |
| Vocabulary | Informal Assessment | Informal Assessment | Quick conversational or observation-based checks for understanding (thumbs up, white boards, first to 5, feedback on students’ verbal response) |

|  | Prior to this lesson, please determine how you will poll students (using the format of your choosing) to debrief after the partner activity. The poll may be done through a formal polling app or by informal methods such as hand raising or having students move to a particular area in the room. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Review the scenario in your student guide. Place a carrot (^) in the lesson plan anywhere you think would be a good spot for a formative assessment. Then, use the graphic organizer below to explain your reasoning. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share and compare your responses.  S: (Turn and talk.) T: (Circulate to monitor student discussions. After a few minutes, guide students in a discussion using the answer key to review if necessary.) T: Let’s talk for another minute about the bellringer. What did it assess?  S: Whether we were able to identify appropriate places for formative assessments.  T: And why do you think I started class with this assessment?  S: To activate our prior knowledge about formative assessments, to see whether we still understood the purpose of formative assessments. | Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Introduction to Informal Formative Assessment Strategies T: Now that you know where to place formative assessments based on best practices, we are going to learn about and practice some strategies. We will start with strategies for informal assessment. Take notes in your student guide as we review each strategy.  S: (Take notes in student guide.) T: Informal formative assessments are used when teachers want a quick pulse check about the general class understanding, when they are looking for patterns or trends instead of individual needs, and – sometimes – when they are interested in student self-assessment of their learning. (Use the PPT to name, describe, and explain the when/why/how of each strategy. Model the strategy for students and engage students in a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of each strategy.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 12 mins | Practice: Scenario Analysis T: Now, it is time to practice. With a partner, review the scenarios provided. Analyze each scenario and then determine the best informal strategy to use. Complete the activity in your student guide.  S: (Move into pairs and complete the student guide activity.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 6 mins | Debrief T: Let’s take a poll to see how you did. Select the best answer for each scenario. (Note: Teacher will need to select a polling platform and create the poll in advance of the lesson.) S: (Complete the poll.) T: Let’s see how you did. (Review the answers to each scenario. Note: Keep in mind that some scenarios may have more than one appropriate answer. Consider engaging students in a discussion of why more than one response can be correct to deepen their understanding of the similarities and differences between the strategies.) T: When are informal formative assessments generally useful?  S: When teachers want to have a quick understanding of the class, when they are looking for patterns and trends instead of individual needs. | Student Guide |
