## Slide 6

### Keys to Effective Practice

- Model and Describe: The teacher shows the students what to do and describes how to do it.
- Pre-empt Pitfalls: Pre-empting something means taking action to prevent it from happening. Applied to the classroom, it means a teacher thinks ahead of time about what will be difficult for students and plans for students to practice those parts.
- Isolate the Step: It’s helpful when students practice the routine in small steps at first instead of trying to practice a multi-step routine all at once.
- Scan and Give Feedback: A teacher is scanning the classroom when they examine the room point-by-point by moving the eyes to observe all students. As they scan, they can give feedback. If they highlight examples of students doing the routine correctly, they can reinforce the routine, which is an action that strengthens the response.
