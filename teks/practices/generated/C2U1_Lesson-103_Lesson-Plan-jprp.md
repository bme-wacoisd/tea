| Rationale/ Summary | Teachers create a strong classroom culture do so through developing strong routines not only for academics, but also for behavior of the students and the culture of the classroom. In this lesson, students will learn what each of these types of routines looks like and how the routines help to create a safe and effective learning environment. | Teachers create a strong classroom culture do so through developing strong routines not only for academics, but also for behavior of the students and the culture of the classroom.

|  | Prepare a way for students who were not present in the previous class to view the video Designing Classroom Systems – Sarah Wright while the rest of the class completes the bellringer. |  |
|  | Prepare to share the video Designing Classroom Systems – Denarius Frazier with students. You will need to log in to Texas TLAC Online to show the video. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think back to the video we watched at the end of our last class. What stood out most to you and why? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Partner Routine: Turn and Talk T: Before we review your answers to the bellringer, we’re going to practice a different routine for working in partners. It’s called Turn and Talk, and we’ll sometimes use it instead of Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up.  T: When I tell you to Turn and Talk, you’re going to turn in your seat to face one of your classmates. It could be someone sitting in front of you, behind you, or next to you. Remember that you are not getting up from your seat, so your partner needs to be someone sitting next to you. You’ll then talk with your partner to answer the question I provide. When your time is up, I will [describe classroom routine for transitioning students from independent/group work to the next activity].  T: Can I have some volunteers to help me model Turn and Talk?  T: (Select a group of volunteers sitting together.)  T: If I say Turn and Talk, which of the other volunteers would you talk to?  S: (Identify the partner they would select.)  T: (Affirm that students’ partner selection aligns with the Turn and Talk routine and correct partner selection if needed.)  T: Now that you’ve seen some of your classmates do it, we’re going to give everyone a chance to practice. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Turn and Talk T: In just a moment, I will ask you to Turn and Talk. When you do, share your answer to the bellringer with your partner. You will have five minutes. Turn and Talk!  S: (Use Turn and Talk routine to identify a partner; share response to the bellringer).  T: (Circulate and help form groups of two as needed.)  T: (Use classroom routine for transitioning students from independent/group work to the next activity.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Procedures, Routines, and Systems T: To this point, we’ve talked about systems and routines. Now that you’re familiar with the idea, we’re going to take it to the next level. Procedures, routines, and systems are each slightly different.  T: A procedure is the step-by-step process for completing a recurring action in the classroom. An example of a procedure is how you enter the classroom, take your seats, and begin work on your bellringer.  S: (Add definition and example to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: When you have completed a procedure many times, it becomes a normal part of how you act. When that happens, the procedure has turned into a routine. A routine is procedures and systems that are automatic and habitual.  S: (Add definition to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: Since this is only our third day of class, it’s understandable that our procedures have not become routines yet. Let’s think of an example of a routine outside of school. Who can volunteer one of their routines for before or after school?  S: Student answers may vary but can include: After school, I walk to the elementary school and pick up my brother. We walk home. I call my mom to let her know we’re home, then I make us a snack. In the morning, I wake up and take a shower. I eat breakfast and get my stuff together. I meet my friend outside of my building, and we walk to the bus together. When I get home from school, I drop off my backpack and take the dog outside.  S: (Add example to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: We have discussed individual procedures and routines. For some things we do in class, we have a few procedures. A system is a set of related procedures that helps a classroom run smoothly and efficiently.  S: (Add definition to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: We move into partners and groups and then back to our whole-group discussion during class. What are the procedures we use to get into pairs?  S: Turn and Talk and Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up  T: What is the procedure we use when you are working in pairs and it’s time to come back together as a whole class?  S: [Describe classroom routine for transitioning students from independent/group work to the next activity.]  T: So, taken together, our three procedures form a system for partner and whole-group work.  S: (Add example to graphic organizer in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Types of Routines T: There are three types of routines in a classroom. Each type contributes to the creation of a safe and effective learning environment.  S: (Complete top box of graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: Academic routines enable students to complete tasks that directly support learning. Behavioral routines help students manage themselves, their space, and their materials while maximizing efficiency. Cultural routines give students clear actions to demonstrate their shared classroom values, norms, and aspirations.  S: (Add definitions to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: Let’s think back to the video we watched at the end of class yesterday. One of the routines we saw was Turn and Talk. What kind of routine is this?  S: A behavioral routine  T: It is a behavioral routine because it focuses on how the students can efficiently get into pairs and have discussions. Everyone knew exactly what to do, which helps create a safe and effective learning environment.  T: Another routine we saw was how the teacher wiggled her fingers at students as she listened to the answers they shared while in pairs. What type of routine is this?  S: An academic routine  T: It is an academic routine because it helps the students know that they are on the right track with their discussions. They are encouraged to continue their discussions and deepen their learning, which helps make the class effective.  T: Another routine we saw was how the students all gave the hammer and said “nailed it” to one of their classmates. What type of routine is this?  S: A cultural routine  T: It is a cultural routine because it is a way that students show respect for each other. Students feel welcome and supported by their peers, which is an important element of a safe and effective learning environment. |  |
| 5 mins | Practice 2: Types of Routines T: I am going to show another video. In this video, the routines are identified and labeled, and you will reflect on a few of them. As you watch, pay special attention to the routines listed in your Student Guide. Note that procedural routines are the same as behavioral routines.  T: (Play video Designing Classroom Systems – Denarius Frazier.)  T: Now, in the box under each routine, describe why that routine is either academic, behavioral, or cultural.  S: (Complete graphic organizer in Student Guide.) | Student Guide Video |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: We discussed procedures, routines, and systems today. They all work together to achieve the same goal. What is that goal?  S: To create a safe and effective learning environment  T: We also learned about three types of routines. What are they?  S: Academic, behavioral, and cultural  T: Describe each type of routine.  S: Academic routines enable students to complete tasks that directly support learning. Behavioral routines help students manage themselves, their space, and their materials while maximizing efficiency. Cultural routines give students clear actions to demonstrate their shared classroom values, norms, and aspirations. |  |
