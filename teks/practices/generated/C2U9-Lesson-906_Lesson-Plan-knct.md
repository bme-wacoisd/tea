## Unit 9: Feedback

### Lesson 9.06: Developing Student Skills for Peer Feedback






Model: Teaching Peer Feedback Script

T: Good morning class! Today we are going to continue working on our Energy books. We have already finished our first draft and today you are going to get the chance to receive feedback from a classmate. This feedback can help us to make our books even better before we complete the final drafts.

T: Remember that we are creating our children’s books to teach kids about the different forms of energy. You were asked to explain each of the forms of energy and provide examples of each in real life. Since these books are being used to teach kids about energy, we want to make sure that we make them understandable for kids ages 5-8. Does anyone have questions about why we are using feedback today or the requirements of the book?

S: (Students ask clarifying questions.)

T: (Display the TAG image on PPT.) To help us give feedback to our partners today we are going to use a strategy called “TAG.”  When we “TAG” we first TELL some things that you liked about the book. Then you will ASK thoughtful questions about your partner’s book and finally you will GIVE positive suggestions that help your partner to make their book even better.

T: Sometimes it is tough to think of feedback to give and that is ok. You will see that under each of the sections there are some sentence starters that might help you to think of feedback to give in each section. Our goal is to provide at least TWO things that you like, TWO thoughtful questions and TWO positive suggestions. Does anyone have questions about the strategy that we will use?

S: (Ask clarifying questions.)

T: I also want you to remember good feedback is always specific, kind, and helpful. What do you think it means to be specific with our feedback?

S: That it is about the book.

T: Yes. We want to make sure that we are thinking about the requirements of the book when we give our feedback. What do you think a specific feedback statement might look like?
S: I like how you included all the forms of energy in your book.

T: Exactly. That explains how the book met the requirements and was clear. What do you think a feedback statement that was NOT specific would look like?
S: Your book is good.

T: Yes, that does not help us to know how the book is good based on the requirements. What do you think that I mean by giving kind feedback?
S: That we want to be nice when giving feedback.

T: Yes. We do not want our classmates to be sad or discouraged. We want our feedback to help them. So, we might say something like you might change your pictures to better show mechanical energy rather than saying I do not like your pictures for mechanical energy. The first statement helps your partner to know what to fix where the second just makes them feel bad.

T: Finally, what is helpful feedback?
S: Feedback that helps my partner to improve their work?

T: Yes, helpful feedback helps our partners to make changes to their work to make it better.  Providing feedback to our partners like “You might consider adding an example of sound energy” helps them to know that they missed that part of the requirement. What would not be helpful feedback?
S: I do not like your book.

T: Exactly. That is not helpful, and it is not kind either. Is everyone clear on the type of feedback we should give? Say it with me “Specific, Kind and Helpful!”

S: (Repeat “Specific, Kind, and Helpful!”)

T: Great. Now I am going to pair you up and give you a handout that reminds you of each of the steps: Tell, Ask, Give. It also will have the sentence starters in case you need a little help as you are working. I am going to give you about 5 minutes to read your partner’s book and then you will have about 5 more minutes to write down the feedback you want to give on your handout. Any questions?
S: (Ask clarifying questions.)

T: Great. After you get your feedback, I am going to give you some time to think about the changes that you want to make to your book based on the feedback. Let’s get started now! (End of Role Play)

| 2 mins | Bellringer Jose just completed a 1:1 student writing conference with his teacher, Mr. Barrier. Mr. Barrier began the conference by greeting Jose and inviting him first to share his thoughts about where his work writing was strong and some areas where he felt he could improve. Jose shared that he feels he really struggles with writing his conclusions but that he does a great job supporting his claims with evidence. Mr. Barrier agreed that providing appropriate and supportive details was a strength of his writing and acknowledged that sometimes it is tough to build a strong conclusion and provided some specific ideas on how Jose might improve. He asked Jose to go back and re—write the conclusion of his essay based on the feedback. After the conference, Jose felt confident and got right to re-writing the conclusion to make it better based on the feedback.   Would you consider this student conference a success? Why? How did the conference described above align to the steps for conducting a 1:1 student conference?  Was there anything that Mr. Barrier could do better next time? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Review T: You just read about Jose and Mr. Barrier. Based on what you read, do you think that the student conference was a success? S: Yes, Jose felt good about the conference afterward and knew how to improve his work. T: Did the conference described align to the steps for conducting a 1:1 student conference we discussed in our last lesson? S: For the most part yes. Mr. Barrier greeted the student, invited him to share his thoughts, shared strengths and areas of improvement and set goals for next time. T: Was there anything that Mr. Barrier could do next time to make the conference even better? S: He could have asked Jose if he had any questions and asked him to reflect on the conference after it was completed. |  |
| 10 mins | Introduction to Peer Feedback T: Locate the Introduction to Peer Feedback section on your student guide.  S: (Locate Intro to Peer Feedback Section on Student Guide.) T: In this unit we have discussed feedback from the point of view of a teacher providing feedback to a student. We have discussed the feedback being informal, or in the moment low stakes feedback, and formal, or systematic feedback given to all students after the completion of a task. Another type of feedback that can support the improvement of learning is peer feedback. What do you think I mean by peer feedback? S: Feedback that is provided to a student by another student or a peer. T: Yes, peer feedback is a practice in the classroom where feedback is given to one student by another. Have you ever given or received feedback from a peer in a class? S: (Answers will vary.) T: When structured well in the classroom, peer feedback can have several benefits that impact learning. Develops a deeper understanding of the task and its requirements. Provides an opportunity for students to learn from one another. Feedback from peers is often received more positively than from teachers. Provides an opportunity for students to take control of their learning. T: Did you ever see any of these benefits when you have experienced peer feedback in the past?  S: (Answers will vary.) T: For peer feedback to support learning in the classroom the students they must be explicitly taught how to give effective feedback. Teachers must also develop the right environment to support giving and receiving feedback.  T: When teaching how to give peer feedback teachers must consider how to: Tailor it to the appropriate needs of the grade level   Communicate and demonstrate that feedback is a normal and necessary part of learning.    T: What is one way that teachers create a safe environment for feedback?  S: Explain the process for feedback and how it will help. T: Yes. To keep feedback focused on the learning task, teachers should provide success criteria for the task and make sure students understand it prior to allowing peer feedback. This also helps students to receive the feedback as a part of improving the task rather than see it as a personal judgement. T: Finally, it helps to allow students to provide peer feedback on activities or tasks that are broader in nature. This helps students to be more reflective about the work rather than “correcting” the work. If it has a right or wrong answer it probably is not a task that is ideal for peer feedback. What types of tasks might be good for peer feedback? S: Projects, activities where students are creating, writing, or explaining. T: What types of tasks might not be an appropriate opportunity for peer feedback? S: Independent practice of word problems or comprehension questions from a reading. T: Exactly. We want tasks where students reflect on the work, not correct the work. Since structure is important in peer feedback, teachers often utilize strategies or protocols for peer feedback. Prior to engaging in the strategy, teachers need to think about how they will introduce the strategy and teach students explicitly how to give effective feedback. T: Here are the steps for introducing the strategy and teaching students how to give effective feedback. Explain the peer feedback process and purpose of the feedback. Introduce the task & success criteria for the task. Introduce the strategy and process for feedback. Explain what effective feedback looks like. Provide scaffolds such as handouts or table charts to keep students on track. Have students reflect on the feedback and next steps.  T: Let us examine one strategy that you can utilize in the classroom to structure the peer feedback process called “TAG.”  In this process, the teacher will choose an assignment that is a “first draft” for a student. This could be a writing assignment, a project or picture/model. Remember the choice of task is important. | PPT Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Model-Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies  T: I am going to model teaching the peer feedback process by introducing you to a feedback strategy called “TAG.” Before I model the process, please locate the scenario for the model in your student guide under Model-Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies.  S: (Locate Model-Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies in student guide.)  T: Please take a minute to read the scenario before I begin the model. (Set timer for 1 minute.)  S: (Read scenario.)  T:  As I model the introduction of the TAG strategy, pay attention to how I work through the steps of teaching students how to give effective feedback. During the role play I will play the role of Ms. Brice and you all will be students in Ms. Brice’s 3rd grade science class.  T: (Model Role Play using script found below lesson plan.)  T: I just modeled through a role play how a teacher might implement a process to teach peer feedback. Let us debrief the experience. As we talk, you can take notes about the examples of each of the steps for teaching peer feedback in the chart under the scenario in the Model-Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies in your student guide.   T: The first step is to explain peer feedback and its purpose. How did I do that in this model?  S: You started by reminding the students about their task and telling them they would get a chance to get feedback from a partner. Then you said that the feedback will help us to make our books even better before the final drafts.  T: Great. How did I introduce the task and success criteria?  S: You reminded the students about the book they were working on and all the requirements for the book.  T: Then I introduced the new strategy “TAG.”  How did I help the students to understand the strategy?  S: You went through each section and explained what TAG meant. You showed us a picture and then pointed out the sentence starters under each section to help give feedback.  T: Yes. Then we talked about effective feedback. Since you were 3rd graders in the role play, how did I make it simple for you to understand what effective feedback looks like?  S: You showed us that feedback should be specific, kind, and helpful. You went through each of them and had the students think of examples and non-examples of each.  T: The next step is to provide scaffolds to help keep the students on track. How did I do that in the model?  S: You told the students they would get a handout with the TAG strategy and the sentence frame where they could write down their feedback for their partner.  T: Yes. Finally, the last step is the have the students reflect on the feedback after they receive it. How did I create the opportunity for reflection?  S: You told the students that after they received the feedback, that you would give them time to think about the changes they could make to their book based on the feedback. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice: Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies  T: Now you will get a chance to practice teaching peer feedback strategies. In your student guide you will find the scenario for your practice under Practice: Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies.  S: (Locate Practice: Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies section on student guide.)  T: Take a minute to read the scenario. (Set 1 minute timer.)  S: (Read scenario.)  T: I am now going to give you four minutes to plan out how you will teach peer feedback to the students in the scenario. Make sure you are considering the steps for teaching peer feedback strategies. You can use the table below the scenario to help plan out your model. After you plan, you will have 4 minutes to practice teaching peer feedback strategies to a partner. Any questions?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: Begin your planning now. You have four minutes. (Set 4-minute timer.)  S: (Plan for model to teach peer feedback strategies.)  T: Ok, now you will practice introducing the TAG strategy to a partner. While the process for implementing the strategy may have the same steps, not everyone will use the exact same language or flow. This time is for you to practice what it feels like to introduce the strategy and teach about effective feedback. Quickly locate a partner to work with and determine who will model first and who will go second. The person who is NOT modeling will keep time for 4 minutes. If you finish before the 4-minute time is up, spend that time reflecting on how the model aligned with the steps for teaching peer feedback strategies. After the four minutes is up, the other partner will do their model. Any questions?   S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: You may begin practicing with your partner now. (Set 8-minute timer)  S: (Take turns practicing teaching peer feedback strategies.)  T: Now that both partners have had an opportunity to practice, take 2 minutes to reflect on your experience. There are three questions at the bottom of the practice section to guide your reflection.  S: (Complete reflection questions.) |  |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: How did it feel to model the peer feedback strategies?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: What areas were the easiest to incorporate into your practice?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Where did you and your partner struggle the most with your model?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Based on what we learned today about teaching peer feedback strategies, what are some specific things that teachers must consider when helping students to learn how to give feedback?  S: You must teach students how to give effective feedback. Teachers also must make sure the environment is safe for students by clearly explaining the process and purpose of the feedback. Structure of the process is important.  T: What are the benefits of utilizing peer feedback in the classroom?  S: Feedback is often received better from other kids than teachers. It also can help students to better understand the task and its requirements. |  |
