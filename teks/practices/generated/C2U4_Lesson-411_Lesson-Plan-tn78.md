|  | Prior to this lesson, ensure you can access the following TLAC video clips:  TLAC Video: Directive & Non-Directive: Michael Towne Texas TLAC Online “Directive & Non-Directive Prompts: Arielle Hoo |  |
| 5 mins | Bell Ringer: Mr. Elliott plans to introduce the concept of rectangles to his class. He wants to provide examples and nonexamples of a rectangle based on the following definition: A rectangle is a four-sided polygon with four right angles.  Help Mr. Elliott by creating two examples and two nonexamples of a rectangle. Then, write a short statement Mr. Elliott might use to explain the connections and distinctions between the different examples and nonexamples. T: Stand up, hands up, pair up. Share your examples/nonexamples and statement with a partner. S: (Find a partner. Share examples/nonexamples and statement.)  T: Please return to your seats. What were some similarities and differences between the different examples, nonexamples, and statements you created?  S: Responses will vary | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | TLAC “Stretch It” Technique T: We have been discussing ways to cognitively engage students including: Assigning Rigorous Tasks and Using Examples and Nonexamples T: Today, we will talk about questions. T: (Display the memory model PPT.) One of the best ways to get the working memory actively engaged is to ask questions that require effortful thinking.  T: (Share via PPT while students take notes in the student guide). When you Stretch It, you respond to students’ correct answers with more challenging questions.   T: Let’s watch a short video clip to see how a high school physics teacher uses a class demonstration to deepen his students’ understanding of molecular theory. As you watch, respond to the following questions in your student guide: How does Michael respond to his students’ correct answers? What message does this send to the class?  T: (Show TLAC Directive & Non-Directive: Michael Towne).  S: (As students watch the video, they will respond to the questions in the student guide)  T: What did you notice about how Michael responded to his students’ correct answers?  S: He responded to students by saying:  so what? which molecules? What’s he talking about? Why are you sure atoms are going off? Tell me more. T: What message does this sent to the class? S: He wants students to be precise and explain their thinking.  T: Yes – By using these prompts he pushes students to answer with precision and confidence. He also makes his classroom feel an actual science lab where no answer is taken for granted and scientists are always searching for why. T: (Share via PPT while students take notes in the student guide). When you Stretch It, you: reward a “right” answer with a more challenging gauge student thinking and help students build long-term memory.  push students to answer with precision and confidence. set the tone for a classroom where no answer is taken for granted and students are always searching for why.  Establish a classroom culture that values a growth mindset | Student Guide PPT TLAC Video: Directive & Non-Directive: Michael Towne |
| 10 mins | Two Ways to Stretch It: Directive Prompts T: We are now going to learn about two different ways you can apply Stretch It – Directive Prompts and Non-Directive Prompts. Today, we are going to focus on Directive Prompts.  T: (Share via PPT while students take notes in the student guide). Directive Prompts guide students to think further in a specific way.   T: Let’s look at six different types of Directive Prompts you might use after a student responds correctly. All six types of prompts ask students to elaborate and expand on their understanding of an idea by describing it in a new context or with new words.    T: Let’s see Directive Prompts in Action. As you watch, record examples of how the teacher uses Stretch It questions to both reveal information about student thinking and build a culture of rigor in your student guide. (Show Texas TLAC Online “Directive & Non-Directive Prompts: Arielle Hoo) S: (Students will record examples of how the teacher uses Stretch it questions to both reveal information about student thinking and build a culture of rigor in their student guide.) T: What evidence did you see of Stretch It questions? S: How did you prove that algebraically? What method did you use? How do you know? By 2? Talk about the result. What do you see as the result? Which is?  T: How did the Stretch It questions Arielle used help reveal student thinking and build a culture of rigor? S: The prompts check for understanding and require students to provide evidence to support their response. | Student Guide PPT TLAC Video: Texas TLAC Online “Directive & Non-Directive Prompts: Arielle Hoo |
| 10 mins | Practice #1 T: Let’s practice creating our own Directive Prompts by examining a couple of student-teacher interactions (Share via PPT). T: Read interaction #1 Interaction #1: Teacher: Use the word "reassured" in a sentence. Student: My mother reassured me that we were safe inside the house during the storm. T: How could the teacher respond using a Directive prompt? S: Can you use a different form of the word “reassured?” T: Yes – what might be another example response? S: Can you give me an example of a character in our novel who “reassured” another character? T: What makes these prompts directive? S: The prompts asked students to elaborate and expand on their understanding of an idea by describing it in a new context or with new words T: Let’s try another example  T: Read interaction #2 Interaction #2: Teacher: What are the three branches of the federal government? Student: The three branches of the federal government are executive, judicial, and legislative. T: Turn to the person next to you and explain how the teacher could respond using a Directive prompt. S: (Students talk with a partner to develop a Directive prompt). T: What were some example prompts you came up with? S: What is the purpose of the three branches? Why did our founding fathers divide the federal government into three branches? How can one branch “check” the power of another branch? | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Practice #1: Role Play T: You are now going to get into groups and role play the use of directive prompts. I will give each person in the group a scenario card. You will each have a few minutes to read your prompt and write out a set of Stretch It – Directive Prompts. Use the guidelines we reviewed earlier to help you develop prompts. After you complete your prompts, you will have time to do a role play in your groups. Non-role-playing students should identify the Stretch It question and the type of stretch it techniques employed and record in the student guide.  T: (Place students in groups and give each student a scenario card.)  S: (Read scenario card.)  T: Based on your scenario, draft a set of Stretch It – Directive Prompts.  S: (Individually draft prompts.)  T: (After a few minutes, allow times for each group member to practice.)   S: (Students will role play their scenario. Non-role-playing students identify which stretch it techniques were employed and record in the student guide.)  Scenario 1: Teacher: Which war was fought between the north and south regions in the United States? Student: The Civil War Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 2: Teacher: Which fraction is larger, ½ or 2/8? Student: The fraction ½ is larger. Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 3: Teacher: If your mom buys 52 grapes and your dad brings home 34 grapes, how many grapes does your family have?  Student: 86 Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 4:  Teacher: Which is larger? 285 or 200 + 30 – 5 + 60? Student: They are equal. Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 5: Teacher: Is the sun a planet, star, or mystery? Student: Star Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question  Scenario 6: “I absolutely love to see the lion tamer perform!” What type of sentence is this? Teacher: Exclamatory Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question Student:  Teacher: Stretch It question | Student Guide PPT Role Play Scenarios |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: How does the use of meaningful questions, such as direct prompts, lead to cognitive engagement?  S: It forces students to think critically and elaborate as opposed to providing a one-word response. It pushes students to make connections and draw on their prior knowledge and learning. |  |
