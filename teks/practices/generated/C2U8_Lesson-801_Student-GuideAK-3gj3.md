Student Guide – Answer Key
Lesson 8.01: Intro to Universal Design for Learning | Part I
Name:
Date:
Bellringer: The coach of a high-school girls’ basketball team is buying shoes for the team. Since the average shoe size of a 16-year-old is a women’s 8.5, she buys everyone the same size.
Provide three reasons why this isn’t a good idea.
The shoes may be too big for some of the players, which could cause them to get injured during the game or practice
The shoes may be too small for some of the players which means they wouldn’t be able to wear the shoes or would get blisters. If they can’t wear the shoes, they can’t play.
The shoes being too big or too small would likely impact the performance of the players.

Intro to Universal Design for Learning
Record your answers to the questions below as you watch the TED Talk video.
How do you design one cockpit that can fit the most individuals?
Student responses will vary.

Why is designing for the average pilot wrong?
Because no two people are the exact same size on every dimension.

What does Todd mean by the quote: “When you design for the average, you design for no one.”

If you design a learning environment for the average student, you aren’t going to meet the needs of any of the students. Designing for the average hurts everyone because no two students are the same on every dimension.

What are two ways designing for the average destroys talent?

Designing for the average doesn’t appropriately challenge students who are gifted in certain areas.
A perceived weakness may overshadow a talent. For example, a student may be skilled in reasoning through complex problems but struggles with reading.

How can we use technology to design flexible learning environments?
Language translation, support for reading, vocabulary, pronounce a word or read a passage for you

How can these technologies support student learning?
It makes the learning accessible to more students.

How did the use of technology help improve Billy’s performance?
He became the smartest kid in the class. Classmates went over to Billy to ask him questions about the assignment. He was able to show his talent for science, whereas before his lower reading level was a barrier to him showing his talent in science.

What does it mean to “ban the average” and instead, “design to the edges?” How can this impact student learning?
To ban the average means to no longer teach to the average. We should design to the edges by ensuring that the learning environment provides opportunities and supports for all students to thrive. This will lead to an increase in student performance and expand their talents in multiple areas.

What is the impact of designing for the average?
High dropout rates, lower performance, lower the talent pool, less competitive with other
Countries.


Defining UDL
