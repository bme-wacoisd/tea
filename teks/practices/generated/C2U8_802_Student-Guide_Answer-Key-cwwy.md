Intro to UDL


UDL Guidelines

UDL Guidelines Overview – Readings for the Jigsaw
Guideline 1: Engagement


If a student isn’t attending to the content, they cannot cognitively engage, but learners differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention. There isn’t one means of engagement that will work for every learner in every context. A learner’s engagement can be influenced by many factors, such as their culture, personal relevance, and background knowledge.
Guidelines for engaging learners:
Recruiting Interest – Teachers must spark excitement and curiosity in all students.
A teacher must consider:
In what ways do I give students choice in how they reach a learning target?
How do I make learning relevant to students’ goals and interests?
In what ways is my classroom supportive for all students?
Sustaining Effort/Persistence – Teachers must help students tackle challenges with focus and determination.
A teacher must consider:
How do I help students focus on the learning target and understand its importance?
In what ways do I provide flexible tools and supports?
How do I foster collaboration and community?
In what ways do I provide feedback to students that guides them toward mastery?
Self-Regulation – Teachers must help students learn to regulate their own emotions and motivation in learning.
A teacher must consider:
How do I support my students in setting personal goals?
In what ways do I help learners develop coping skills and strategies?
How do I provide opportunities for students to self-assess and reflect?

Guideline 2: Representation

Learners perceive and comprehend information that is presented to them in different ways; therefore, there isn’t one means of representation that will work for every learner. A student who is blind or deaf can’t access the content that same way as someone who isn’t.
Students must experience the learning in multiple ways to engage the working memory to make meaning of and connections between the ideas and concepts. This helps move the learning from the short-term to the long-term memory.
Guidelines for multiple means of representation:
Perception – Teachers must provide the same information in different ways, such as visually, orally, or through movement.
A teacher must consider:
How can I provide options for how information is displayed?
What support can I provide students who need assistance with engaging with auditory or visual information?
Language & Symbols – Teachers must provide alternative representations for both language and symbols to create a shared understanding.
A teacher must consider:
How do I pre-teach vocabulary or symbols and provide definitions, explanations, or illustrations?
In what ways do I make vocabulary and key information available in and make connections to a student’s first language?
How do I present key concepts and learning in multiple formats?
Comprehension – Teachers must provide scaffolds and activities that cognitively engage student to help develop their ability to construct meaning and generate new understandings.
A teacher must consider:
How do I activate and provide background knowledge?
In what ways do I support students in attending to the most important information?
How do I use models, scaffolds, and feedback to support students in processing information and transferring their learning to new contexts?

Guideline 3: Action & Expression

Learners differ in the ways they approach learning tasks and in the way they express what they have learned. There is not one means of action and expression that will be optimal for all learners; therefore, teachers must provide multiple options to allow students to express and communicate their learning. It is important to provide alternative modalities for expression, both to the level the playing field among learners and to allow the learner to appropriately (or easily) express knowledge, ideas, and concepts in the learning environment.

Guidelines for multiple means of action and expression:
Physical Action – Teachers must provide materials and tools that are accessible to all learners.
A teacher must consider:
How do I provide alternative ways for students to interact with instructional materials?
How do I provide access to and support with tools and assistive technologies?
* Assistive Technologies are any form of device, technology, or equipment that helps students with disabilities participate, communicate, and learn.
Expression & Communication – Teachers must provide flexibility in how students share knowledge, ideas, or concepts in the learning environment.
A teacher must consider:
In what ways do I provide opportunities for students to communicate through multiple forms of media?
How do I provide opportunities for students to share their thoughts and ideas using tools that complement the learning goal?
In what ways do I provide differentiated levels of support and scaffolds to support independent learning?
Executive Functions – Teachers must help students learn how to set long-term goals, plan effective strategies to reach their goals, monitor their progress, and modify the strategies as needed.
A teacher must consider:
How do I support learners in setting challenging and authentic goals?
In what ways do I support learners in developing reasonable plans for reaching their goals?
How do I support learners in processing and organizing information?
In what ways do I provide specific, timely, and actionable feedback to help learners move forward in their learning?

| Universal Design for Learning (UDL) | An educational framework to guide the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences through engagement, representation, and expression. UDL minimizes barriers and maximizes learning for all students. |

| Learning Styles | UDL |

| The concept of learning styles is often misinterpreted to mean that individuals have fixed and rigid ways of learning. | Supports the understanding that all learners benefit from multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression, which are the key guidelines for UDL. |
