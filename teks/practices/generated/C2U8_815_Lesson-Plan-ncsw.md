| Rationale/ Summary | Learners vary in the way they engage with, comprehend, and demonstrate their understanding of content. When preparing to teach a lesson, a teacher must consider the individual needs and preferences of the students in their class and incorporate multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression to level the playing field for all students.  In this lesson, students will incorporate the guidelines for UDL into an instructional plan with which they are already familiar. Students will then deliver the lesson and receive feedback in subsequent classes. | Learners vary in the way they engage with, comprehend, and demonstrate their understanding of content.

|  | Note: Students will need the lesson they planned and delivered in Lessons 6.12-6.14  from the Instructional Alignment unit. Students will review this lesson and revise it to include at least one component from each of the three guidelines for UDL. Students will then deliver the lesson and receive feedback on the use of the UDL guidelines to provide access for all students. |  |
| 3 mins | Bellringer: What does a teacher need to think about when planning instruction to include the guidelines for UDL? You may write you response in paragraph form or create a list. |  |
| 2 mins | T: (Solicit responses from student to the bell ringer question highlighting sample answers in the student guide answer key.) S: (Students provide answers.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Putting It All Together - Introduction  T: The last three lessons in this unit will give you a chance to prepare, deliver, and get feedback on a lesson in which you have incorporated at least one component from each of the three UDL guidelines.  You will use the same lesson you planned and delivered in the Instructional Alignment unit.   T: Given what you know about learning, why do you imagine that practicing a lesson and getting feedback helps teachers – and in this case you – become better at teaching?  S: Practice with feedback is one of the main ways we learn things – so that applies to learning to teaching just like it applies to math, science, or any other subject.  T: The first thing we will do is review the lesson you planned and delivered in the Instructional Alignment unit. Remember, you each chose one of three lessons and taught that lesson to two other students in your triad who acted as third grade students by participating in your lesson and providing you feedback.  S: (Access planned lesson from Instructional Alignment Unit.)  T: Today, you will have time to modify the lesson to include the guidelines for UDL and prepare to teach the lesson. In the two subsequent lessons, we will practice delivering the lessons and you will get feedback from your classmates. | Student Guide  Sample Lessons (from Lesson 6.12) |
| 15 mins | Preparing to Teach Using UDL  T: I’d first like you to read through the lesson you planned and delivered in the Instructional Alignment unit to familiarize yourself with the lesson.   T: Please use your preparation table in your student guide as you read your lesson to record where you see elements of UDL in the lesson.    S: (Students individually read their lesson using the preparation table to capture their notes).   T: (Circulate while students read and work doing checks for understanding and answering questions.)  T: Based on the evidence of UDL you noted in your preparation table, I want you to plan for how you as the teacher can incorporate the UDL guidelines to ensure this lesson is accessible to all learners based on the following fictional class description:  Our class consist of 15 students. Of those students, there are 3 who are classified as academically gifted in reading, but not in math. There are 6 struggling readers, and 4 English Language Learners. You have one hearing impaired student who has a full-time interpreter. Based on your student interest survey, most of your students prefer to work in groups, with a handful who prefer to work alone.   T: Use your preparation table in your student guide to prepare how you will reteach your lesson using the UDL Guidelines based on the description of the class. Note that you do not need to include all the elements, just those you feel would be most appropriate for your lesson and the makeup of your class.   S: (Students individually plan how they will incorporate the UDL guidelines into their lesson using the preparation table to capture their notes.)  T: (Circulate while students plan doing checks for understanding and answering questions.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief and Questions   T: Thank you all for reviewing your lesson plans in preparation for practicing tomorrow!  T: In the guide, we asked you to identify any outstanding questions.  Are there any questions about the lessons themselves that need clarification?  S: (Students ask any outstanding questions.)  T: (Respond to student questions.)  Note to Teacher: The excerpted lesson sections make reference to lessons and ideas that came before. The selections were chosen to be executable in this short period of time.  Students may raise questions about vocabulary, the content and/or how the instruction is intended to be delivered that you can answer to ensure there that you address any prior knowledge about the unit or the content. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Pair-Up Practice  T: Tomorrow, you will teach your lesson to two classmates who have not read or prepared for your lesson.  T: Before we do that, we are going to give you a chance to prepare with another person who has the same lesson as you.  T: (Have students pair up – pairs of ones, twos, and threes who have the same lesson.)  T: In your pairs, I want you to rehearse the very first parts of the lesson – so you have some practice with how to start up for tomorrow. When one of you in the pair is presenting, have the other act as a student and provide feedback.  T: (Display rehearsal sections on PowerPoint). The rehearsal sections are as follows:  For ELA: Please rehearse instruction beginning at page 12, through the section where students read the words and tell you what letters to circle for /k/. For Math: Please rehearse the instruction for Problem 1 on page 12. For Science: Please rehearse the Launch through the first butterfly life cycle sort (page 184 – 185).  T: I am going to give you 4 minutes each to practice this part.  After 4 minutes, the other partner will practice.  S: (Student rehearse their above section with their partners.)  T: (At 4 minutes, tell the pair to switch their practice.) |  |
|  | Debrief:  T: What worked well for you during your practice session?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: What did you learn during your practice session?  S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
| 5 mins | (Students complete the exit ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
