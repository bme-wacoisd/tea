- What is explicit teaching?  How does it help students to learn more effectively?
When something is explicitly taught, a teacher guides students through the learning process, step by step, with clear explanations, procedures, and success criteria. Students would have a clear example of what they are supposed to do, and explanation of why it is important and how to do it successfully.  They could replicate the example.

- Below is a script for modeling how to generate and organize data.  Analyze the script and provide evidence of where you found the key modeling practices demonstrated in this example.






| Key Modeling Practices | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Small, Learnable Steps | The teacher starts first with generating data by creating a list of students and their favorite colors.  Then they move to how they might be able to organize and make sense of the data by collecting it in a chart with tally marks. |
| Visual Demonstration | The teacher demonstrated visually the process of making tally charts and representing the numbers in each category by making slashes.  Also, how to group the tally marks bundles of 5. |
| Verbal Explanation | The teacher explained each step.  “Each tally like the one I drew has a value of one student.  Count with me” |
| Connect the Steps | Makes connection with prior vocabulary and moves from intro to tally marks to how to draw them to represent data.  There is a purpose for each action that is explained. |
| Check for Understanding | The teacher checks for understanding with questioning (How can we keep track of our data in an organized way? How might writing each 5th tally mark with a slash help you count your data easily?) |
