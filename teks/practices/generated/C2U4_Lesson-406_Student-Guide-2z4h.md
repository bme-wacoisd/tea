| Strategy Highlight: Stations Station teaching can allow you to differentiate and/or personalize learning for students while also giving students opportunities to experience content in various meaningful ways. To implement stations, teachers must first consider how each station activity correlates to class learning objectives and standards. Teachers must think about whether station activities will be independent, discussion-based, completed with a partner, teacher-led, etc. Then, teachers must prepare materials for each station, including directions for each station. It is important to be as organized as possible when implementing stations so that students can work independently without the teacher having to field questions about how to manage each station’s activity so (s)he can monitor student progress across stations and answer content-related questions. Pre-grouping students and using a timer that is visible to the entire class can help ensure smooth station transitions. |
