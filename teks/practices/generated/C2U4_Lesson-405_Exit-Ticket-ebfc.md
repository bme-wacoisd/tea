Name:
Date:
For the following scenarios, explain how the teachers can effectively leverage prior knowledge to support their students’ learning.
Scenario 1: Mrs. P is beginning a new science unit on balancing chemical equations. She asks her class to brainstorm a list of everything they know about equations. She learns that her students recently studied equations in math class. How can this information help her teach her new material?




Scenario 2: Mrs. B gives her students a pretest before beginning a new math unit. The test is 20 questions and, because it is taken on a computer, students receive an immediate score. Mrs. B notices that this activity takes a lot of time, and her students seem unmotivated after receiving their scores. What could Mrs. B do to make this activity a mor effective prior knowledge activity?
