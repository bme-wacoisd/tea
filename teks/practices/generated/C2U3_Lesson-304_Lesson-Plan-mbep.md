| 5 mins | Bellringer Read the scenario located in your student guide.   Underline strategies Ms. Guajardo uses to learn more about and build trust with her student Henry. Strike through things Ms. Guajardo should not do.  What else might Ms. Guajardo do to continue to understand Henry, build trust and rapport, and help him academically in the classroom? | Student Guide PPT |
| 2 mins | Bellringer Debrief T: Let’s review your answers. What did Ms. Guajardo do well?   S: She used what she knows about Henry to find a comfortable time and place for them to meet. She used familiarity by meeting him somewhere he wouldn’t be surprised to see her. She showed interest by asking a follow-up question.   T: What are some things Ms. Guajardo might have done better or differently?   S: When she found Henry she started immediately talking about his grades and falling asleep in class. She could’ve started with a non-academic conversation instead. Ms. Guajardo wasn’t very empathetic. She told Henry not to worry instead of showing him empathy. When her phone rang, she should have turned it off and not answered.   T: What additional strategies might Ms. Guajardo have used?   S: She could have tried to use what she knew about him to find something they were both interested in and started the conversation with something about their common interest. Instead of telling him not to worry about the divorce, she could have expressed empathy and concern. She could reach out to the family to get more information from them.  T: Nice job analyzing that scenario and bringing together everything you have learned so far about getting to know your students, listening authentically, and generating trust. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Trust Generator Review  T: A couple of days ago, you engaged in a role play to practice authentic listening. Today, you are going to engage in a role play to practice using trust generators.   T: What are the trust generators we learned about yesterday?   S: Selective vulnerability, familiarity, similarity of interests, concern, and competence.   T: Yes, and we just talked about how Ms. Guajardo used some of these in her interaction with Henry and how she could have used others to build trust with Henry. Using trust generators effectively takes practice. It is important to remember to maintain boundaries as you build trust with students.  T: Let’s do a quick review of how to identify examples and non-examples of the trust generators we’ve learned about. (Pass out an index card to each student.) On one side of your index card write the letter A, on the other side write the letter B. Write these letters large enough that they can be seen when you hold them up.  S: (Write A and B on index cards.)  T: I am going to read two scenarios for each trust generator. When I say “vote,” hold up the letter you think is correct.  T: Which of these is an example of Selective Vulnerability?  While demonstrating a problem, the teachers stops and thinks aloud about something she is struggling with. She says, “This part is difficult because…” She and the students work through the problem together to see if the answer makes sense. A teacher is demonstrating how to solve a multi-step fraction problem. Her students point out that she made a mistake in her explanation of the process. She gets frustrated and directs her students to finish the assignment without her guidance.  T: Ready? Vote.  S: (Hold up “A” side of index card.)  T: Very good. The answer is A.  What do you think might be hard about selective vulnerability?   S: Knowing what to share and what not to share.   T: Yes, that can be hard and is a very important boundary to maintain.  T: In this scenario, you are looking for the example of familiarity.  Mr. B is a new teacher in town. He wants to better get to know his students, so he volunteers to lead the Environmental Club after school. The club has five students, and two of them are from his class. He has met some of the parents and is planning a field trip for the club members. Mr. B is a new teacher in town. He wants to better get to know his students, so he has been attending school and community events. When he sees his students, he gives them a high five and introduces himself to the students’ families.  T: Ready? Vote.  S: (Hold up “B” side of index card.)  T: Very good. The answer is B.  This one was tricky, though. In the first scenario, Mr. B was doing a great thing by volunteering for the club—but why does this not represent familiarity?  S: Because only a few students were in the club, and not all of them were his students so he was not becoming familiar with them or their parents/community.  T: Very good! The next scenario is regarding similarity of interest. Ms. Z plays pickleball with her family on Sundays. Lately she’s seen some of her students at the pickleball court, so she says hello to them and their parents. If students mention it in class the following weeks, Ms. Z tells them it’s not appropriate to talk about outside activities and redirects them to the content. Ms. Z plays pickleball with her family on Sundays. Lately she’s seen some of her students at the pickleball court, so she says hello to them and their parents. Since she knows the students are interested in the sport, she’s been using pickleball examples in word problems to make her math instruction more relevant.  T: Ready? Vote.  S: (Hold up “B” side of index card.)  T: Very good. The answer is B.  It might feel natural sometimes to want to protect your outside time when you’re in the classroom; and while it’s appropriate to set boundaries you can use similar interests to engage students and focus their attention to learning.  T: Next, let’s look at a scenario about concern.  Students in Mr. P’s eighth grade class fill out a survey at the beginning of each school year. Mr. P reviews the students answers and keeps them in a file on his desk if he notices a student seems disconnected. In that event, he uses the survey answers to start a conversation. Students in Mr. P’s eighth grade class fill out a survey at the beginning of each school year. Each week, Mr. P reviews the students surveys and tries to mention one thing from the survey in conversation with the student.   T: Ready? Vote.  S: (Hold up “B” side of index card.)  T: Very good. The answer is B.  Showing concern does not necessarily have to take place when a student is in crisis, is disconnected from the content, or seems to not be themselves. To build strong relationships, concern can be and should be shown for students throughout their school year.  T: Lastly, let’s take a look at scenarios surrounding competence. Ms. E is a veteran teacher. She knows a lot about her content, but consistently attends professional development seminars to learn new instructional practices. She offers to assist new teachers by allowing them to shadow her class. Ms. E is a veteran teacher. She knows a lot about her content and enjoys teaching in the way that she has for over 25 years. When asked by a new teacher for advice she says, “The way I teach is different than the way new teachers teach, it  would probably be better to observe Mr. W.”  T: Ready? Vote.  S: (Hold up “A” side of index card.)  T: Very good. The answer is A. It is important for teachers to understand and feel confident in their ability to teach, but it is also important to adapt how we teach content based on new strategies for our students. | Student Guide PPT Index Cards |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Planning for Role Play T: Now, it’s time to plan for your role play. There are two scenarios for the role plays. You will work with a partner to plan for one of the role plays together. Please find the role plays in your student guide.  S: (Find role plays in student guide.)  T: Count off by twos. (Point to the first student.) You are a one. (Point to the next student.) You are a two. (Point to the next student.) You are a one. (Help students continue to count off.)  S: (Count off by twos.)  T: Ones stand up. Find a partner who is standing.   S: (Ones stand up and pair up.)  T: Ones, you will plan to be the teacher for scenario 1. Twos, stand up and find a partner.  S: (Twos stand up and pair up.)  T: Twos, you will plan to be the teacher for scenario 2.  T: Underneath the scenarios, you will find a planning guide. Work with your partner to respond to the questions and plan your conversation with the student in the scenario.   S: (Plan.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Role Play T: Now that you have planned your conversation, it is time to role play. You will now switch partners. Ones, find a two to work with.   S: (Find a new partner.)  T: We will begin with scenario 1. If you planned for this conversation, you are the teacher. Your partner will be the student. Remember as you role play to listen authentically to the student in the scenario and to respond to the student in a way that continues to build trust.   T: I will set the timer for 4 minutes. After the timer goes off, you will have a minute to debrief with your partner before round 2. You may begin.  S: (Engage in round 1 of role play using scenario 1.)  T: Time is up. You have one minute to debrief with your partner. Discuss what went well and what could have been better.  S: (Debrief role play.)  T: Now it is time for round 2. I will set the timer for 4 minutes. After the timer goes off, you will have a minute to debrief with your partner. You may begin.  S: (Engage in round 2 of role play using scenario 2.)  T: Time is up. You have one minute to debrief with your partner. Discuss what went well and what could have been better. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: What did you find hard about putting the trust generators into practice?   S: (Answers will vary but may include: listening authentically while planning what to say, maintaining boundaries, knowing how to respond to the student.)  T: Why is it important to practice trust generators?   S: Because they can be hard to implement especially while maintaining boundaries. Also, because they are used in times when students may be in distress, so it is really important to respond effectively. | Student Guide |
