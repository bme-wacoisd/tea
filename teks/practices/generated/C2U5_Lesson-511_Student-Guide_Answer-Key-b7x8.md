Bellringer:  What is the purpose of summative assessment?  How is it different from formative assessment?
Summative assessment is intended to measure how well a student has learned the standards or benchmark taught within the instructional unit.  It is a “summary” of the student learning assessed at the end of the unit.  Formative assessment is used to determine student progress and occur while the learning is still happening.  It helps to inform what teachers do next to help students master the content.


#### Notes: Types of summative assessments




#### Practice 1: Identification and Assessment of Effective Summative Assessment


A first-grade math teacher is planning her assessment for a unit on developing number sense.  She has the following content and skills that she wants to assess at the end of the unit:
- Construct and/or explain different representations of a chosen number
- Count up to and from the chosen number
- Explain ideas using mathematical language
- Connect mathematical knowledge to other ideas in math, other disciplines, or everyday experiences
- Demonstrate mathematical reasoning by justifying their work
She is considering three different options for a summative assessment.  She can dedicate one to two days for assessment if needed but really wants her students to engage in this task as number sense is a foundational concept in her math curriculum.

Which of the following should the teacher choose as her assessment for the unit?  Justify your answer using details from the scenario and characteristics of effective assessment.
The teacher should choose the performance task.  It is the only one that aligns to the standards with both rigor and content.  The criteria for the task are clearly outlined and the scenario provides a purpose and authenticity for students which they will find engaging.  The teacher has allotted 2 days so that is a reasonable time and it make sense to spend the time and try to find an engaging task because the concept is foundational for students in their math learning.

Practice 2:  Revising Effective Summative Assessment
Using the examples of summative assessment provided in practice 1, what recommendations would you make to each to align it better to the characteristics of effective assessment?

Practice 3: Analyzing, Evaluating, and Revising Summative Assessments
A Health and PE teacher is planning a unit on nutrition.  The goals for the unit include:
- Explain the importance of a diet in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
- Understand the importance of consuming a variety of nutrient dense foods and beverages in moderation.
- Select a variety of nutritious foods that align to the guidelines of a healthy diet.
Below are some descriptions of potential summative assessments.  Identify the type of assessment and then provide recommendations on how to better align that assessment to the characteristics of effective assessment.



| Type of Assessment | Description | Purpose/Benefits/Challenges |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quiz | Shorter summative assessment  Simple, content-focused questions.    Selected response (multiple choice/matching/etc.) or short answer formats  Questions have a single, best answer. | Good for assessing information, concepts, or a discrete skill.  Easy and quick to grade. |
| Test | Like quizzes but longer more comprehensive in evaluating standards  More formal, including a combination of selected response, short answer and longer answer formats (writing prompts).   Questions have a single, best answer. | They may take longer to grade than a quiz but can provide a more complete picture of learning due to the larger number of questions. Good for remember, explain or analysis type questions. |
| Essay | Open-ended prompts or questions that require the student to think critically, not just recall knowledge.   Not a single best answer as they require a student to defend or explain the answer given. | Involve analysis, synthesis, or evaluation Grading takes longer and requires more judgement by the teacher Requires a set of success criteria. |
| Project | Provide an opportunity for students to display and apply their learning to produce a creative product.    Projects typically take longer to complete, sometimes several days. | Students have a greater opportunity to personalize the task and find the experience more authentic and engaging. Grading takes longer and requires more judgement by the teacher  Requires a set of success criteria. |
| Performance tasks | Require students to “perform or demonstrate” the skills and competencies.   Include a complex challenge, problem or scenario that is like those faced by adults, making them.   Can be short (1 day) or last over several days | More authentic, engaging for students Require higher level of thinking (analysis, synthesis, evaluation) Students have greater opportunity to personalize the task |
| Portfolio | Collection of student products that demonstrate learning against a set of learning objectives. Include a student reflection of their work and progress. Portfolios take longer for students to put together as the work must be done over time. | it is easier to assess progress against the learning targets because of multiple student work samples More complete picture student learning there are multiple pictures of performance rather than a one-time assessment.   Take longer to grade as a teacher must evaluate several pieces of work/reflections Require set of success criteria |


| Description of Assessment | What Type of Assessment? | Is this an example of effective assessment? Why/Why not? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assign several questions that ask students to draw pictures of different numbers, match pictures with numbers and fill in missing numbers from a sequence of numbers on a line | Test | No, it doesn’t align to all the standards/skills outlined by the teacher. It doesn’t allow students to explain the representations or their ideas.  Also, no opportunity to connect math knowledge to other ideas. |
| Assign the students a scenario where they are developing an episode on a popular children’s show.  Ask the students to create an episode where they can choose any number, they want but need to display at least 4 different ways to represent the number, demonstrate how to count in different ways for this number and explain why you chose the number.  The information can be presented as a book or poster and the student will present the episode to the class. | Performance task | Yes, this is effective assessment.  It aligns to all instructional objectives with content & rigor.  Criteria is clearly outlined, and it is practical because the teacher has allotted 2 days for the assessment. |
| Assign students to create a flip book that shows different representations of a number.  They can use any materials they want to create the representations but must show at least 3 different ways to count the number and represent it. | Project | No, while this is practical and the criteria is clearly outlined, this project does not align to the rigor of the instructional objectives. |


| Assessment Example | Suggestions for Improvement |
| --- | --- |
| Assign several questions that ask students to draw pictures of different numbers, match pictures with numbers and fill in missing numbers from a sequence of numbers on a line | Where students are asked to draw pictures of the numbers, ask them to explain their thinking.  Ask a question where students provide an example of where students use representation of numbers in their other classes or outside of school. |
| Assign students to create a flip book that shows different representations of a number.  They can use any materials they want to create the representations but must show at least 3 different ways to count the number and represent it. | Add a component of the project where students are asked to present their flipbook, explaining their thinking to the audience.  Also ask the students to utilize real life examples to connect counting to other disciplines or outside of school. |


| Description of Assessment | Type of Assessment | Adjustments to make it an effective assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Students will keep a food diary for a week, recording what they eat each day. | Project | Students could do a reflection at the end of each day that allows them to classify they foods they have eaten as healthy or unhealthy and reflect on how diet is important to overall health. |
| Students will answer a number of questions about nutritional guidelines.  Students will be asked to classify examples of foods as “healthy” or “unhealthy” | Test | The teacher could include a short answer question asking students to explain how diet is important to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. |
| Students will be given the prompt “How does nutrition impact your overall health and well-being?” and students will respond in writing. | Essay | Students could be given clear criteria for the number of pieces of evidence to include and how to include specific guidelines and examples of healthy and unhealthy food options. |
| Students will create a nutritionally balanced menu for campers at an outdoor residential camp.  The menu will consist of breakfast, lunch, and dinner and 3 snacks each day. | Performance task | Students could write a letter to the director of the camp explaining their choices and how they fit into a nutritious diet and why it is important for the campers to have a nutritious diet to maintain health. |
