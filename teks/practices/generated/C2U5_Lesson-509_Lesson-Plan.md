| Rationale/ Summary | The exit ticket is an essential tool for intentional planning. It allows a teacher to assess learning each day to make purposeful plans from the previous day’s instruction. In this lesson, students will learn the characteristics of effective exit tickets and will learn to evaluate, and revise exit tickets to ensure the exit ticket meets success criteria | The exit ticket is an essential tool for intentional planning.

| Formative Assessment  And Exemplar Response | Examine the good (but not great) 1st grade Exit Ticket below. As you read, consider whether the exit ticket meets each indicator of the success criteria or not. Complete  the graphic organizer to show your thinking and provide suggestions for improvement if criteria are not met.

| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 mins | Bellringer: 1. When are quick and informal formative assessments useful?  2. Based on your understanding of quick informal formative assessments, when might teachers need to use additional types of formative assessments? | Student Guide PPT |
| 2 mins | T: So, what do you remember about informal formative assessments?  S: (Share responses to bellringer questions.) | Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Introduction to the Exit Ticket T: Today, we are going to look at another informal formative assessment that can provide teachers with more individualized data about student understanding – the exit ticket. Take notes as we talk about the definition, purpose, and success criteria.   S: (Take notes on student guide.)  T: Now, let’s watch a video to get a little deeper. Follow along and respond to the video viewing guide questions in your student guide. We’ll discuss the video after it’s over.   S: (Answer questions as they watch.)  T: What is the purpose of an exit ticket for students?   S: To show what they learned.   T: What is the purpose of the exit ticket for the teacher?   S: To analyze their lesson to see what worked and what didn’t, to intentionally plan for the next day’s lesson, to see which students understood the lesson and which students didn’t and may need extra support.   T: How is an exit ticket different than the informal formative assessments we learned in our previous lesson?   S: It provides more concrete data about individual students.   T: Now that you understand what exit tickets are and how they are used, let’s look at a couple examples and analyze them in relationship to the success criteria. I’ll do the first one for you. Follow along on your student guide as I annotate the example for you. (Show the math example on a projector or document camera. Engage in a think-aloud to analyze the exit ticket as shown in the Student Guide Answer Key.)  S: (Annotate the example on their student guide as modeled by the teacher.)  T: Now let’s do the next one together. How does the science example align to the success criteria?   S: (Volunteer answers.)  T: (Annotate the example as students provide responses.)  S: (Annotate on their student guide.) |  |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Analyzing Examples  T: Now it’s your turn to analyze exit tickets without me. You will work with a partner to identify ways that the next two exit tickets align with the success criteria. If you are in an odd row, turn to your left to find your partner. Even rows, turn right.  S: (Turn to partners and complete the activity.)  T: (After about 6 minutes provide an opportunity for students to share responses with another pair.) Now you will have time to compare your answers with another pair. If you are sitting in an odd row, turn to your back to find your partner pair.  S: (Share responses with another pair.) |  |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Revising a Non-Example T: Now, let’s look at a non-example. With your original partner, review the exit ticket in Practice 2. Identify opportunities for revision based on the success criteria and make suggestions for improvement. S: (Work with partner to complete Practice 2.) T: (After about 6 minutes provide an opportunity for students to share responses with another pair.) Now you will have time to compare your answers with another pair. If you are sitting in an odd row, turn to your back to find your partner pair. S: (Share responses with another pair.) |  |
| 3 mins | Debrief T: How did you improve the non-example?  S: (Share suggestions for improvement.) T: What should a teacher consider as they evaluate or create exit tickets?  S: Alignment to the most important content, varying rigor and question type, keeping it concise. |  |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the exit ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
