Bellringer:
A student’s behavior is disrupting the lesson. The student is yelling out during class and throwing materials. Why would a teacher choose to talk to the student privately instead of redirecting him in front of the other students?











Intro to Private Individual Corrections

Key Terms

What are the five keys to private individual corrections?




Video Notes
Listen to an interview with Doug Lemov and Nicole Willey, who teaches third grade at Leadership Prep Ocean Hill as they talk about Private Individual Corrections. Take note of the steps and important practices while implementing Private Individual Corrections.


Five Keys to Private Individual Correction


Practice 1: Video Analysis, Part 1
In your small group, look for evidence of one of the five keys of effective implementation: Maintain Privacy, Describe the Solution, Use a Warm or Neutral Tone, Bookend with Simple Tasks, and Keep it Brief.

Watch the video of the analysis of a Private Individual Correction in a fifth-grade math class and capture evidence of your assigned key in the video analysis graphic organizer below.



Practice 2: Video Analysis, Part 2

| Keys for Effective Private Individual Correction | Evidence from the video |
| --- | --- |
| Maintain Privacy:  Here are a few ways you can maintain the privacy of your correction: Give the class a task to complete so that you're intervening at a time when it's easy to be "off-stage" Circulate for a moment instead of making a bee-line to the student so that other students have a moment to get started Crouch down to the student's eye level Speak quietly |  |
| Describe the Solution:  Describe what you’d like your student to do (as opposed to what not to do) in order to meet your expectations (e.g., “During class discussion, it's important that you give your peers your full attention: eyes and ears on them.”).  This lets students know what they did wrong while also ensuring they learn from it. |  |
| Use a Warm or Neutral Tone:  It can be challenging to maintain emotional constancy when delivering a Private Individual Correction, especially if you've already redirected the student several other times in different ways.  But communicating your frustration through your tone will only undermine your efforts to get your student back on track.  Therefore, be sure to use a warm or neutral tone of voice when you speak. |  |
| Bookend with Simple Tasks:  Start and end your interaction with a pair of observable directions.  Start with an “in-task” that students can complete to show they’re ready (e.g., “Pause your writing” or, "Eyes on me, please.") Close with an “out-task” that tells students what they can do to get back on track right away (e.g., “Pick up your pencil and begin right away. Thank you.” or “Start with question 1. Thank you.”) |  |
| Keep it Brief:  Keep the correction short so that the student can get back to the learning as quickly as possible. |  |
