| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |

| 3 mins | Bellringer: Complete the anticipation guide located in your Student Guide. | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | T: Take a minute to compare your bellringer answers with a partner. If you are in an odd row, turn to the person behind you. See if you can come to a consensus on whether each statement is true or false.   S: (Compare and discuss answers.) |  |
| 8 mins | Defining Assessments: Formative and Summative  T: Today we are going to learn about assessments. We will return to your bellringers at the end of the lesson. Let us start with defining assessment. T: Turn in your student guide and find the graphic organizer titled “Defining Assessments: Formative and Summative.” This is where you will take notes.   T: Assessments tools used to collect information about student understanding of learning targets. Teachers use assessments to make data-based instructional decisions and to communicate progress with students. Assessments also provide an opportunity for students to bring new information into their working memory.  T: Based on your understanding of the Simple Memory Model, why is it important for students to have the opportunity to remember things— to bring things into their working memory?  S: It increases the likelihood that new information will be moved to long-term memory.  S: (Take notes on student guide.)  T: What are some assessments you have experienced? Think of different tools your teachers use to collect data about your learning.   S: Tests, quizzes, projects, essays.   Note: Students may not have examples of formative assessments as there may be a misconception that all assessments are summative. Be prepared to share examples of formative assessments with students if they are unable to identify them on their own (exit tickets, online quizzes, classroom discussion activities, fist-of-five, whiteboard responses, feedback/edits on essays, etc.)   T: Assessments are not only tests and quizzes. Even though these are the assessments you might think of first when you hear the word assessment, there are many types of assessment in teaching. We are going to learn about two types of assessments – formative and summative assessments.   T: Formative assessments are low or no-stakes assessments that gather data about a small number (1-2) learning target. What do you think we mean when we say, “low or no-stakes”?   S: (Answers may vary).   T: Low stakes assessments are those that represent a small percentage of the student’s grade. A no stake assessment has no impact on a student’s grade. A quiz, for example, may be considered a low stakes formative assessment because a teacher may count the grade toward student progress, but it does not have the same weight or cover as much content as other assessments may.   T: Who can give me an example of a no-stakes assessment that we use in this class?  S: The Exit Ticket.  T: Great! Exit Tickets are an example of a no-stakes formative assessment that lets the teacher know if students understood the material covered during a particular class period.  T: Formative assessments are useful because teachers can use them throughout their lessons to monitor learning and guide instruction. What are other examples of formative assessments of which you can think?  S: (Suggest formative assessments—teacher should verify if something is formative or if it should be revisited after discussing summative assessments).  T: Unlike formative assessments, which are given periodically throughout a lesson or unit, summative assessments are high-stakes or graded assessments, given at the end of a learning sequence, which gather data about student mastery of multiple learning targets.   T: A test is an example of a summative assessment that you have seen before. Tests are typically given at the end of a learning unit and test on multiple objectives or goals. They are also typically a larger portion of your final grade than items like quizzes, journals, or homework.   T: What are some other examples of summative assessments you can think of?  S: (Answers will vary—teacher should verify if something is summative or if it would better fit in another category). 	 T: Assessment is a vital part of the teaching and learning process. How does assessment help teachers?   S: It helps teachers plan for instruction based on what students know.  T: How does assessment help students?  S: It provides opportunities for learners to practice multiple times allowing it to move into long-term memory. | Student Guide PPT |
| 6 mins | Practice 1: Comparing Formative and Summative Assessments  T: Find the Venn diagram on your Student Guide.   S: (Find Venn diagram.)  T: Based on the definitions and purpose of formative and summative assessments, what do you already know about the similarities and differences between the two? (Model completing the Venn diagram as students suggest answers).  S: Formative assessments measure student performance on a small number of learning targets (1–2) and summative assessments measure multiple learning targets. Formative assessments take place throughout a learning sequence. They can be at the beginning, middle, or end. Summative assessments take place at the end of a learning sequence. Formative assessments are used to inform instruction and summative assessments are used to evaluate learning. (Complete the Venn diagram along with the teacher.)  S: (Add definitions of key terms to the student guide and the terms and other notes to the Venn diagram.) |  |
| 16 mins | Practice 2: Sorting Activity (1-3-6 Consensus)  T: I am going to give you a set of 6 assessments. On your own, sort them into two piles. A pile of formative assessments and a pile of summative assessments. Be prepared to share and defend your choices by referring to the definitions of each type.   S: (Individually sort the assessments).   T: Now that you have completed the activity on your own, you are going to work in a small group of 3 and come to a consensus on your answers. After five minutes, you will join another group to compare.   T: (Move students into groups of 3 to the extent possible. You may need one or two smaller groups of 2.)  S: (Move to their groups and compare their answers. Discuss and come to consensus on any discrepancies.)  T: It is time to compare answers with another group. If there are any discrepancies between your answers, share your reasoning and see if you can come to a consensus. (Pair groups.)  S: (Move to their combined groups, share answers, discuss, and come to consensus.)  T: Let us review the answers. (Share answer key with the students.)  T: How did you do? If you got any wrong, what was your reasoning and what questions do you have?  S: (Share any answers they got wrong. Explain their rationale and ask questions.)  T: (Provide an opportunity for other groups to explain why the answer was wrong and the rationale they used to get the answer right.)  T: Now let us talk about how the card sort activity is an assessment. First, what type of assessment is it and how do you know?   S: Formative. It was low-stakes. You did not grade it. Also, it served as a practice opportunity while we are still learning about the differences between types of assessments.   T: And remember that formative assessments are helpful for the teacher to gather data about what students are understanding and what they may still need help learning. What information was I able to gather?   S: (Respond to the question. Answers will vary based on what students were able to do on their own during the card sort and what questions or tasks still confused them or needed teacher explanation.)  T: Now that I know what you know and do not know, I can plan my next steps. We will talk more about planning next steps in a later lesson. |  |
| 4 mins | Debrief  T: Let us look back at your Bellringer and review the statements.   S: (Turn to the Bellringer in their Student Guides.)  T: What is the purpose of assessment?  S: To provide the teacher with data to inform instruction and to provide students multiple opportunities to retrieve information from their short-term memory.   T: Why is number 2 false?   S: Formative assessments are sometimes no-stakes so not graded at all.  T: Why are assessments given every day?   S: Because they are used to inform a teacher’s next steps and to provide an opportunity for students to retrieve new information.  T: How is assessment a part of the learning processes in your brain that we talked about when we explored the simple memory model?   S: Recalling new information multiple times gives students the opportunity to move new learning to long-term memory.  T: What type of assessment are journals and graphic organizers?   S: Formative assessments. |  |
