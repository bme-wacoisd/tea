## Student Guide – Answer Key

### Lesson 1.04: Planning and Delivering Effective Directions

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:
Think about the routines that we use in class., including what to do when you enter the classroom, Stand Up – Hand Up – Pair Up, and Turn and Talk. What do these routines have in common?
Student examples can vary but may include:
They help us have a safe and effective learning environment.
We do them every day.
The teacher showed us how to do them before we practiced.


Notes: Three Key Characteristics of Effective Instructions
When should a teacher provide effective directions?
During a transition, which is the space and time between instructional activities during which teacher and students make a shift from one activity to another.


Practice 1: Example and Non-Example of Effective Directions
Directions #1:
Think about whether you agree or disagree with the author of the editorial we read. Get into groups to discuss your answer and how you will support it. Gather feedback from your group. Write a letter to the editor in which you agree or disagree with the author.

Are these directions specific?			Yes			No

Are these directions sequential?			Yes			No

Are these directions observable?		Yes			No

Directions #2:
In your Student Guide, write down whether you agree or disagree with the author of the editorial we read, including at least three arguments that support your opinion. When you are ready to get feedback from your peers, silently walk to the back of the room. At the back of the room, stand next to one or more of your peers. When four people are standing together, move to the side of the room for discussion.
Each group should identify a timekeeper. Each student takes three minutes to explain their position and supporting arguments. The other three students each have one minute to provide feedback. The author takes notes on the feedback in the space provided in the Student Guide. Complete this feedback process until all group members have shared.
When your group has completed its work, return to your seat. Using the feedback you gathered, write a three-paragraph letter to the editor in which you agree or disagree with the editorial.

Are these directions specific?			Yes			No

Are these directions sequential?			Yes			No

Are these directions observable?		Yes			No



Practice 2: Video on Effective Directions
Specific
Give an example of how Ms. Crucetti gave directions that were specific.
She told them to circle their answers to the subtraction problem.
How does this example show what it means for directions to be specific?
Students know how they should mark their answer when they have solved the problem. That is more specific than just telling them to write their answer on the page.
Sequential
Give an example of how Ms. Crucetti gave directions that were sequential.
She asked the students to count the circles first. Then, she told them to write the number that was one less.
How does this example show what it means for directions to be sequential?
The students knew the order of steps to solve the subtraction problem. First, they had to count the number of circles, then they had to take one away.
Observable
Give an example of how Ms. Crucetti gave directions that were observable.
She told the students to put their fingers on box 1.
How does this example show what it means for directions to be observable?
She can see if the students are putting their fingers in the right place.


| 1 | Specific: describe concrete actions that students should take |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Sequential: set out the order in which actions should be taken |
| 3 | Observable: the teacher needs to be able to see the students following the directions |
