## Slide 5

### Calm Down Corners

- It is. . . “a designated place where students can go when they are feeling overwhelmed or upset. The purpose is to create a safe space where kids can practice self-regulation skills and work to calm themselves.”
- It is not. . . “designed to be used as a punishment. Instead, it is designed to be a space that offers students a break from frustration and stress while they work to recover composure.”
- Purpose:
- Helps keep students in class as much as possible – even when they are having a hard time. Time in class increases student achievement.
- Helps students learn to control their emotions and learn to self-regulate.

### Best Practices

- Select a spot in your classroom that is not in a high-traffic area. While you don’t need a large space, make sure there is room for a student to move a bit and the area is relatively free from distractions.
- Use a small rug or seating to define the space and create a comfortable spot for students.
- Add a calming box or toolkit with sensory tools and fidgets that can help students refocus and decompress from the stress they were feeling. Consider adding a visual timer if you feel students may be likely to abuse the space.
- Add purposeful decorations and signs to help students select and utilize calming strategies.
