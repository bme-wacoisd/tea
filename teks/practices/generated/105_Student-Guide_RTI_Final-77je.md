Scenario 1:
Ms. North’s high school English class will be spending a class period in the school media center to work on their research projects. There are not enough computers for everyone to complete online research at the same time. She wants everyone to be able to have some time to work at the computer and some time to consult other resources in the media center.
Develop effective instructions for Ms. North to provide when her class arrives at the media center.









Scenario 2:
Ms. South’s fourth grade students have been outside for recess. Some of them played basketball, while others played on the playground. She wants the students who played basketball to put the balls in a large bin near the door to the school. She then wants all students to line up outside the door before walking back to the classroom.
Develop effective instructions for Ms. South to provide when recess is over.
