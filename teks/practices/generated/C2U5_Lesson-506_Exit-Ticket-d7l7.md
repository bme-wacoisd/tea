### Lesson 5.06: Strategic Questioning Continued

Name:
Date:
Mr. M. is teaching a lesson about creating claims based on evidence. His goal for the day is that his students will be able to create a claim based on evidence in a text and then collaborate with peers to refine their claims.
- Review the lesson goal and the pre-planned questions. For each question, determine what information the teacher can learn and what their next steps might be.
Adapted from: https://reading.amplify.com/educator/resources/pdf/v1/mCLASS/G2_Claim_and_Evidence_(Literary).pdf

- Evaluate the question set as a whole. Does the question set meet the characteristics of effective questions? Explain your reasoning.


| Activity | Planned Questions | Purpose of the Question (what the teacher can learn) | Teacher’s next steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bellringer: Students will read a short paragraph that includes a claim supported by evidence. Students will circle the claim and underline the supporting evidence. | What is the claim?  What evidence does the author use to support his/her claim? |  |  |
| The teacher will engage students in a whole group read aloud of Jack and the Beanstalk. | Why is Jack’s mother worried?  Why do Jack and his mother decide to sell the cow?  Why does Jack take the beans?  What happened to the beans overnight? |  |  |
| The teacher will share statements about the text and will ask students to agree or disagree. | Jack made a good choice when he traded his cow for five beans. Do you agree or disagree?  How can you support your opinion with evidence from the text? |  |  |
| The teacher will provide a new statement and ask students to agree or disagree individually. Students will work on their own to find evidence to support their reasoning. | Do you agree or disagree?  How can you support your opinion with evidence from the text? |  |  |
