What are the characteristics of effective assessment? (Record your responses in the graphic organizer below.)
Review the objective and assessment provided. Evaluate and provide suggestions for improvement based on the characteristics of effective instruction. (Record your responses in the graphic organizer below.)

About halfway through a lesson about the characteristics of living things, Mr. Johnson wants to know if his students can differentiate between living and non-living things based on a taught definition before they begin to develop a list of characteristics of living things. If they can, he will move into the next part of the lesson during which students will compare several living things to find their similarities and develop a list of characteristics based on those similarities.
To determine whether students are ready to move on, Mr. Johnson provides each student a handout with images of living things and non-living things. The images are new images, not images reviewed in class. He asks them to circle the living things and put an X over non-living things. At the bottom, he includes a bonus question: Name three characteristics of living things. Then, because Mr. Johnson wants students to do their best so that he gets good data, he tells them that this activity will count as a quiz and the bonus question is extra credit.


Objective: Students will be able to develop a list of characteristics of living things



#### Think Aloud and Practice 1


Objective: Recognize the value of coins and count up to find their total value.

#### Practice 2: Non-example


Ms. Vallejo is teaching a lesson to her 2nd grade class about different strategies to make $1 or make change from $1. Read the scenario below. Identify the formative assessments she uses and then explain why they are problematic and what Ms. Vallejo might do instead for a better assessment.

Ms. Vallejo begins class by reminding her students that in the previous lesson, they learned how to identify a set of coins that added up to $1. She asks her students to give her a thumbs up if they remembered the lesson. Most of Ms. Vallejo’s students give a thumbs up, so she decides to move to the next part of the lesson – how to make $1 or make change from $1 using different strategies.
To introduce the lesson, Ms. Vallejo engages her students in a discussion about making change. She asks students if they have ever seen anyone make change before. She asks them where people might need to make change. She guides students to identify places including restaurants, grocery stores, and other stores like Walmart and Target.
Next, Ms. Vallejo hides some coins in her hand. She gives a student some coins and asks the student to coin the total amount of her coins. The student counts total amount and says she has 17c. The teacher then models for the students how to determine how much is hiding in her hand by telling the students that the amount in her hand added to the 17c the student has makes $1. She explains that one part is hiding, and one part is known. Together, the two parts make a whole that equals $1. She models how to write a number sentence on the board and then models how to solve the number sentence. She guides the students through two more examples and then tells them that they are going to practice counting the total value of coins on their own using a practice worksheet.
After students work on their own, Ms. Vallejo reviews the answers, responds to questions, and provides feedback. Then, she tells students that they are going to complete an exit ticket. The exit ticket asks students to answer word problems to find amount needed to make $1 based on various known amounts.

|  | Met or Not Met |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aligned to learning targets and appropriate level of rigor (focuses on the most important content) | Met – identifying living things is a step in the process of learning their characteristics so it is aligned to the objective. The assessment does not get to the level of rigor in the objective but it is a formative assessment in the middle of the lesson so it doesn’t need to. |  |
| Fair and transparent | Not met – formative assessments should be no or low-stakes. Quizzes are generally high stakes. Also, Mr. Johnson includes a question for a part of the lesson that hasn’t been taught yet and provides extra credit if students know it. This is not fair. | Delete the bonus question and don’t count the activity as a quiz. |
| Practical | Met – Students can quickly complete the activity and it will only take a quick scan for Mr. Johnson to know whether or not each student understands the lesson so far. |  |
| Cognitively engaging | Met – identifying each living thing requires that students apply their understanding to new and various examples. They have to think about how each image aligns with a definition of living things previously taught. |  |


| Assessment | How is the assessment aligned to the objective? | What information does the teacher learn from the assessment? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decomposition tree | In order to complete the decomposition tree, students must know the value of various coins | Whether students are able to break totals down into smaller parts of two; whether or not they are able to identify correct/incorrect pairs |
| Concept development discussion | In order to respond to the teacher’s questions, students must know the value of various coins | Whether students can recognize individual coins and identify their value |
| Concept development (Part 1) – whiteboard problems | Students find total value using number sentences | Whether students can write number sentences to represent multiple coins  Whether students can complete their number sentences to find total value |
| Concept development (Part 1) – skip-counting similar coins | By skip counting, students are finding total value | Whether students can skip count by 5’s or 10’s |
| Concept development (Part 2) – skip-counting various coins | By skip counting, students are finding total value | Whether students can skip count by 5’s and 10’s mixed together |
| Concept development (Part 2) – practice set | By counting mixed groups, students meet the lesson objective to recognize the value of coins and count up to find total value | Whether students have met the lesson objective with a small amount of coins (5 or less) |
| Concept development (Part 3) – turn and talk | By counting mixed groups, students meet the lesson objective to recognize the value of coins and count up to find total value | Whether students have met the lesson objective with a larger amount of coins; whether they can use the easiest way by recognizing tens |
| Concept development (Part 3) – practice set | By counting mixed groups, students meet the lesson objective to recognize the value of coins and count up to find total value | Whether students have met the lesson objective with a larger amount of coins; whether they can use the easiest way by recognizing tens |
| Application problem | Students apply the skill taught during the lesson to a real-world problem to show that they can recognize the value of coins and count to find a total in a real world problem | Whether students can apply the isolated skill to a real-world scenario |


| Assessment | Problem | Suggestion for Revision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thumbs up, down, sideways | The assessment is not aligned to the objective. It is about whether they remember a lesson, not whether they know the content of the previous lesson | Begin with an assessment that will let her know who understood and remembers how to identify a set of coins to make $1. Maybe use |
| Class discussion | The assessment is not aligned to the objective. It is about whether students can identify scenarios in which making change is important. It does not assess any foundational knowledge. | Change the discussion to focus on prior knowledge about coins that make up $1. |
| Practice worksheet | The assessment does not provide opportunities for students to practice number sentences and finding amount needed to make a dollar and is not aligned to the level of thinking required in the objective. Instead, the assessment provides opportunity for students to practice a prior knowledge skill. | Change the practice to focus on amount needed to make a dollar. |
| Exit ticket | The lesson only met half of the objective, teaching students to add up to $1. The lesson did not engage students in thinking about how to make change from $1. | Add another step to the lesson to teach students how to make change from a dollar before assessing this skill or change this assessment to focus on adding up to $1. |
