Additional Notes:
Practice: Collaboration Scenarios
Scenario 1:  You are noticing that after lunch students are leaving trash and debris in the hallways as they return to class.  This is becoming a significant problem, not just for your own students but those who all belong to the entire 6th grade team.  You bring the concern to the next 6th grade team meeting to discuss and determine next steps for addressing this situation.
Scenario 2:  You just finished grading an assessment that you gave to your 3rd grade students yesterday.  It seems like over half of your students were not proficient on the identified learning targets.  You are disappointed that your students didn’t do well and know that you will likely have to reteach the content.  You take this issue to your PLC to see if this was a problem for all classes or just yours and what you can do to better support your students.
