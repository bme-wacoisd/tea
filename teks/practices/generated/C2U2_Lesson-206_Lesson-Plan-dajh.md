| Rationale/ Summary | This is the first of two lessons on Positive Framing: Frame Redirections Positively. In this lesson, students will learn how to Assume the Best by analyzing examples of this technique in action and drafting an Assume the Best statement for a scenario. In this lesson, students will learn about Positive Framing to frame interactions, particularly corrections, in a way that reinforces trust, while guiding students toward a better course of action. | This is the first of two lessons on Positive Framing: Frame Redirections Positively.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will review the scenario posed earlier in the lesson and compare the Assume the Best statement they drafted to the example provided from Texas TLAC Online. Students will respond to the following questions: How does your statement compare to the one provided?  How did the example statement attribute behavior to positive intent, tell students exactly what they should do and maintain economy of language?  How did the example statement above tell students exactly what they should do?  How did the example statement above maintain economy of language?  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Students will review the scenario posed earlier in the lesson and compare the Assume the Best statement they drafted to the example provided from Texas TLAC Online.

| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Prior to beginning the lesson, ensure you can access the following videos:  Frame Redirections Positively: Hilary Lewis Frame Redirections Positively: Gillian Cartwright |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Describe a time when your behavior was corrected by a parent or teacher. What did they say or do? Did their correction work? Why or why not? | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | T: (Provide time for students to share their responses with a partner.)   S: (Share with partners.)  T: Who would like to share with the whole group?   S: (A few volunteers will share.) |  |
| 3 mins | Intro to Positive Framing:  T: Today we are going to focus on framing redirections in a positive way. During the video we are about to watch, Hilary notices that some students are not fully attending to her teaching. As you watch the video, consider how Hilary maintains students’ privacy and communicates her belief that students want to be successful, even as she delivers a redirection? Record your observations in your student guide.   T: (Show students “Frame Redirections Positively: Hilary Lewis” (Texas TLAC Online).   S: (Record their thoughts on the 2.6 Student Guide.)   T: What did you see during the video?  S: She avoids naming names, she uses a simple if/then statement to communicate what she expects, she communicates her trust in her students when she frames the shapes as “a distraction,” and Hilary’s tone and volume communicate her calmness. | Video: “Frame Redirections Positively: Hilary Lewis” (Texas TLAC Online)  Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes on Six Rules of Positive Framing: T: Hilary demonstrated a redirection technique called positive framing. Why might this technique be effective at redirecting student attention or behavior?   S: It is respectful toward students, shows a clear expectation, and is delivered in a calm way.   T: There are six rules to doing Positive Framing well. As we review them, please take notes in your student guide. (Review the six rules using the PPT.)  S: (Record notes in the 2.6 Student Guide.)  Live in the Now Assume the Best Allow Plausible Anonymity Narrate the Positive and Build Momentum Challenge! Talk Expectations and Aspirations  T:  Today, we are going to focus on how to Assume the Best.  (Use the PPT to share information about Assume the Best.)   T: When student motivation for a behavior is unclear or ambiguous, it’s best to assume good faith on students’ parts and to reflect this in your language. This implies that you trust students and are confident enough that you assume students would not fail to follow your directions without some good reason. This applies whether the behavior is academic, like using APA citation in a written response, or behavioral, like following the routine for cleaning up after an art lesson.  T: To effectively Assume the Best, use the following behaviors:   Attribute behavior to positive intent: When students are making a good-faith effort, avoid ascribing ill intention to what could be the result of distraction or genuine misunderstanding Be specific about what you want students to do: Hold students accountable for following through by ensuring they know exactly what they should be doing Maintain Economy of Language: Use few words Maintain Emotional Constancy: It’s best to use a neutral tone and facial expression when delivering redirections of any kind  S: (Take notes in the student guide.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Study the example and upgrade the nonexample T: Here are some go-to phrases that will help ensure you are assuming the best about your students. (Via PPT, share some of the TLAC go-to phrases for Assume the Best from Texas TLAC Online.)   S: (Follow along with the PPT.)  T: Where do you see examples of assuming positive intent in this teacher language?  S:  Students are excited to get started, students wanted to do something but just forgot, students who are not doing what they are supposed to just forgot.  T: How is the language specific?   S: “totally clear,” “complete parts 1 and 2 first”  T: What’s an example of economy of language?   S: Answers will vary – students should be able to describe what a long-winded alternative would be.  T: How might you say each of these examples in a neutral tone? What would it sound like if the teacher were not using a neutral tone? (Ask for a few volunteers to model saying each statement aloud using a neutral tone and a non-neutral tone) Student Excitement: “Some of us are so excited that we’re already jumping in. Before you start, please make sure your desks are totally clear.” Student Forgetting: “Pause. A couple of us forgot to complete planning before drafting. Please complete parts 1 and 2 of the prep sheet first.” Teacher Clarity: “I wasn’t clear enough. First, be sure to jot down your word or phrase as part of your annotation.” Student Confusion: “It seems like a few of us might be confused. Let me model one more before you go back to independent work.”  Upgrade the nonexample  T: You will now look at two statements that do not meet the success criteria. Work with a partner to identify how the statements do not meet the success criteria and adjust the statements to improve them.  S: (Complete the activity with their partner using the student guide.)  T: (Circulate through the room as students work to upgrade the statements. Check for and provide feedback on students’ understanding of how the statements meet or do not meet the criteria.) | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Practice 2: Analyze Assume the Best in action T: Now let’s see this in action. While you watch, look for evidence of Gillian’s Economy of Language and Emotional Constancy. Consider how Gillian assumed the best intentions. (Show students “Frame Redirections Positively: Gillian Cartwright”.)    S: (Record notes in the 2.6 Student Guide.)   T: What did you see?   S: Gillian says “In just a moment. I appreciate the enthusiasm.” In just a few words she attributes student’s behavior to positive intent, while maintaining positive body language.  T: Why is economy of language and emotional constancy important when using Assume the Best?   S: It communicates clearly that: mistakes are part of the learning process, you are there to help them learn, and the focus should remain on the content. | Video: “Frame Redirections Positively: Gillian Cartwright” (Texas TLAC Online)  Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 3: Creating effective Assume the Best statements T: Now, it’s your turn. With your partner, you will practice planning and delivering an Assume the Best redirection using the following scenario on your student guide. Start with planning. As you plan, ensure your Assume the Best statement: Attributes behavior to positive intent Tells students exactly what they should do Maintains Economy of Language Maintains Emotional Constancy  S: (Use the scenario in their student guide to plan and deliver Assume the Best redirections while using the feedback rubric in the 2.6 Student Guide to provide specific feedback to their partner on the alignment to the success criteria.)   T: (As students practice in their groups, circulate from group to group to provide feedback. Share feedback based on trends with the whole class between rounds.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Think back to the redirections you reflected on during the bellringer and compare those to the redirections you developed. How do they compare?  S: Answers will vary.  T: What is the impact of using Assume the Best to reframe directions?   S: Builds trust and relationships between students and teacher. | Student Guide |
