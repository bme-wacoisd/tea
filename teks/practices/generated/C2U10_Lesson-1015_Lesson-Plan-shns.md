| 5 mins | Bellringer:  In the previous lesson you worked to identify your personal “why” for entering the field of education.  What are two key points that you want to be sure to convey in your personal philosophy statement regarding your personal why? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Personal Philosophy of Education T: A teacher’s philosophy of education is important because it shapes everything you do in the classroom. If part of your philosophy of education is that all students have the potential to be successful, you will make instructional decisions that reflect that.  Your philosophy of education is influenced by your background, your beliefs, your values, and your growing knowledge about education and educational experiences. It will evolve over time with more experience and practice. You may have written a personal philosophy in course 1 Principles of Education and Training.  Now that you have had an opportunity to learn more about the field of education, practices that guide effective instruction, and utilized or observed some of those practices within a classroom it is time to revise your personal philosophy. T: In the bellringer you were asked to identify your personal “why” for pursuing an education career.  That is one part of the personal philosophy.  Additionally, the personal philosophy statement should include: Why does being a teacher matter?  What do you believe are the central tenets of good teaching? What do good teachers do? What strengths do you bring that will help you to become a teacher? What are areas of growth that you have? What subjects or grade levels would you consider teaching? T: In this lesson you are going to work on a draft of your personal philosophy of education.  This philosophy will be roughly 5 paragraphs in length.  Please locate the section of your student guide titled “Personal Philosophy of Education”. S: (Locate section of student guide). T: In this section you will see I included the success criteria for your personal philosophy statement.  (Display ppt slide with success criteria). Please take two minutes to review this success criteria now. (Set timer for 2 minutes.) S: (Read through success criteria.) T: You will notice that there are five categories for which you will need to address.  Most of the success criteria for the sections ask you to provide at least 2 supporting details for each. I have provided space below the success criteria on your student guide for you to brainstorm before you begin writing.  What questions do you have for me? S: (Ask clarifying questions.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 30 mins | Writing a Personal Philosophy Statement T: You will have about 30 minutes to begin working on drafting your personal philosophy statement today in class.  In our next class you will engage in a protocol to receive feedback from a peer before you make final edits to your personal philosophy.  I will be around to answer questions and provide support as you are working.  Please raise your hand if you need assistance.  You may begin working now. (Set 30-minute timer.)

S: (Responses will vary.)  T: Were there parts about writing the personal philosophy statement that felt easier? What do you think made them easier for you to express?  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: In our next class we will gather feedback from peers on how to improve your personal philosophy statement before we finalize it to include in your portfolio.
