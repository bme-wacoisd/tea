Third grade | PhD Science TEKS Edition | Module 2 | Lesson 17 (page 184) | The lesson you will teach starts on page 184 and runs through page 187 (intro to Butterfly Life Cycle and beginning part of sequencing organism cards). You will need the Science Lesson Resource document which includes a butterfly picture for the beginning of your lesson and a card sort for your students to arrange life cycles. Note that your lesson includes a 2-minute video. You should have access to a computer during your sample lesson to access and play the video. |
