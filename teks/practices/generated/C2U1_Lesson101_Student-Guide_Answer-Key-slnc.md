Fold the stock paper on your desk hotdog style to create a table tent.
On the outside, write your preferred name. Write it large and in a bright color so your teacher and classmates can see it. We will use these name tents to learn each other’s names over the next few days.
On the inside, write a story about your name. This story might be about your given name, your preferred name, or your nickname. You might have a story about your first name or your last name or maybe even your middle name. Your story might be a story of family and history or a story about how your friends came to call you by a nickname. Tell any story you’d like about how you came to be called by your name.
