### Lesson 10.09: Collegial Practices | Mentorship

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:
Think about a time in your life when you were learning a new skill (such as how to play piano) or were new to a group (such as your first day in a karate class). How did you feel during that time? Did you have anyone who guided you through that process until you felt comfortable on your own?
If yes, how did that person help? If not, why do you think it could have been helpful to have someone to help guide you?
