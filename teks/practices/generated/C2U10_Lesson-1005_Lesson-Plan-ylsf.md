| 3 mins | Bellringer: What do you think makes a good teacher? How do the practices you have learned in this course support what you said makes a good teacher? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief:  T: Turn and share your responses with another student. S: (Turn and talk to partner). T: What do you think makes a good teacher? S: Someone who can build relationships, someone who has effective classroom management, someone who intentionally plans aligned instruction, someone who plans with all students in mind T: How do the practices you have learned about in this course support those characteristics? S: Each of those characteristics have been taught and practiced in this course. T: How can we ensure that the teachers hired in Texas have these characteristics?  S: Through certain requirements and training. T: Right – Texas has certain certifications and requirements to become a teacher. Today, we are going to explore the educational and certification requirements and steps to become a certified teacher in Texas. |  |
| 10 mins | Notes: Becoming a Classroom Teacher in Texas T: Why do you think certification and educational requirements exist for teachers?  S: To become a highly effective teacher, individuals must go through training and examinations to assure that they are prepared for the rigors and requirements of becoming teacher.  T: What are the different pathways of becoming a teacher in Texas? (share via PPT).	 S: (Write responses in Student Guide.)  T: The first pathway is a Degree Program and Texas Certification or “Traditional Pathway.” In this pathway, individuals complete a traditional Educator Preparation Program in undergraduate and complete their certification requirements simultaneously. 4-year program. T: What is an Education Preparation Program or EPP? S: A program for people to become teachers. T: An EPP is a teacher preparation program through an institution or organization that provides aspiring educators with the initial training and requirements to become a teacher. T: Another main pathway is the Texas Alternative Certification Process or “Alternative Certification Pathway.” In this pathway, individuals complete the requirements of becoming a teacher while they are teaching. This is commonly a one-year program. T: The last pathway that is offered by both institutes of higher education and alternative certification pathways is a residency program. A residency is a paid, intensive year-long clinical experience that pairs an aspiring teacher with a qualified mentor. T: In a residency program: The resident (student teacher) coteaches with a qualified mentor. The resident receives support from their EPP and from the district during the residency. T: A sample resident schedule is to coteach 3 days a week and sub or work as a para the other two days. In this way, the resident earns a salary. Residencies are not offered by every program in the state but are growing. T: What do you already know about what is needed to become a teacher in Texas? S: Responses will vary. T: (Record student responses, circle the responses that are requirements to becoming a teacher.)  T: I have listed the three main requirements for becoming a teacher in Texas: 1) A bachelor’s degree; 2) Clinical teaching or internship; and 3) Passing a certification exam. Let’s first define these components. Please refer to the vocabulary box in your Student Guide.  S: (Find vocabulary box.)  T: (Project with PPT.) A bachelor’s degree is a four-year degree received from an accredited undergraduate institution.  Clinical teaching is a student teaching experience where students are supervised by a certified teacher in a public-school classroom.  Internship is a paid and supervised classroom teaching assignment for one year. Certification Exam is a test that, when passed, qualifies a person to receive a teaching certificate. S: (Write definitions in chart.)  T: Take a few minutes to brainstorm why you think these might be the three main requirements. Use the blank space provided in the chart.  S: (Brainstorm why these are requirements to becoming a teacher.)  T: Turn to the person next to you and share a few of the reasons you think these might be the three main requirements. S: (turn and talk.)  T: The reasons these are the requirements to becoming a teacher is to ensure that teachers are highly qualified, knowledgeable, and skilled to successfully teach students.  T: Please write as I project various reasons on the board. A bachelor’s degree is a requirement because it helps:  Individuals receive a well-rounded education in various subjects, and in specific subject. Individuals strengthen critical thinking skills, creativity, work ethic, problem-solving ability, written and verbal communication techniques, among others.  This prepares teachers to have a strong knowledge for a specific subject or grade-level, and to have the skillsets to interact and guide students successfully.  S: (Write response in Student Guide.)  T:  Clinical teaching or internships are a requirement because they help:  Individuals practice and receive feedback on teaching from a mentor teacher. S: (Write response in Student Guide.) T: Passing a certification exam is a requirement because:  To test if the teacher has adequate knowledge in their subject area and ensure they are qualified to teach that subject.

| 20 mins | Practice: Steps to Becoming an Educator in Texas Jigsaw T: Now that you have learned about the various pathways and the three main requirements for becoming an educator in Texas, you are going to further explore the steps to becoming an educator in Texas for each of those pathways.  T: I am going to divide you into four groups. Two groups will explore the steps for the traditional pathway and the other two groups will explore the steps for the alternative pathway.  T: Using the table in the Student Guide, your device, and the webpages linked in your Student Guide, your group will become an expert on your assigned pathway. Take great notes on the steps to becoming an educator for your assigned pathway because you will be responsible for sharing that information with another group. T: You will have 10 minutes to complete the chart in your Student Guide. You do not need to write every specific detail – it only needs to be a short description. T: Are there any clarifying questions? S: (Ask questions if needed). T: You may begin. S: (Work with expert group to research assigned pathway) T: (After 10 minutes) Your time is up.  T: Now that you have written the steps for your assigned pathway, you will team up with another group who explored the steps for a different pathway. The groups that explored the traditional pathway, please team up with the other groups that explored the alternative pathway. S: (team up with another group). T: Each group will have 5 minutes to share what you learned about your assigned pathway with the other group. As each group shares, the other group members will record important points in your Student Guide. T: Are there any clarifying questions? S: (Ask questions if needed). T: I will keep time and let you know when it is time to switch groups. You may begin. T: (After 5 minutes, have groups sharing switch roles.) Now it is time to switch. The group that was sharing out will now listen to the other group and take notes in your Student Guide. T: (After 5 minutes, bring students back together to review.) T: What do you notice about the requirements we discussed for becoming a teacher in Texas and the steps for these programs? Turn to the person next to you and discuss. S: (Turn and talk.) S: They are the same – first you have a bachelor’s degree, then you get teaching experience, then you pass a certification exam.  T: Correct! Let’s write these in our similarities box on the next page. (Write similarities mentioned in the box.)  S: (Write similarities in the similarities box.)  T: What are other similarities? Please write them in the box as I write them down. (Call on students.)  S: (List similarities and write them.)  T: Now turn to the person next to you and brainstorm some differences. Take a few minutes to work on this together.  S: (Write differences)  T: (Circulate room and assist students, as necessary.) T: What are some differences? S:   Responses will vary but may include:  Traditional Pathway:  4-year undergraduate Educator Preparation Program at an institute of higher education. Receive teaching experience while completing their undergraduate degree. Alternative Certification Pathway:   Earn a four-year degree first. Apply to an alternative program. Complete coursework Internship   T: A few other things that are important to note about these programs, which you can summarize in the box below are (Read aloud and write notes as you dictate):   1.  Alternate certification requires a bachelor's degree before entering the program. 2.  Alternate certification internship experience is paid. The intern receives mentoring but is responsible for all teaching duties during the internship. 3. In the traditional pathway, the student teacher gradually takes over responsibility from a mentor teacher. 4. There are high quality alternative certification programs and high-quality institutions of higher education. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Why might someone follow an Alternative Program Certification process instead of a traditional one? S: Someone may have studied something in undergraduate and not have decided yet they wanted to be a teacher – or they decided to be a teacher later.  T: What would be the benefits of Alternative Program Certification process?  S: You don’t have to decide whether or not you want to be a teacher right away and you can go through the process later on.  T: What would be the benefits of the “traditional process” of Undergraduate Degree and Texas Certification? S: You would come right out of undergraduate with a degree and certification. You could start a job right away. And you would not have to be teaching and learning at the same time. T: What are a few differences in the two pathways? S: In a traditional pathway, you receive your training in undergraduate and in an alternative pathway you receive your training after undergraduate.  S: In a traditional pathway, an individual teaches in a classroom during their undergraduate degree and is supervised by a mentor teacher, and in an alternative certification pathway, teachers are paid and do all the instruction.  T: What are similarities? S: They require the same three steps. |  |
