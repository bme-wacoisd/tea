| Rationale/ Summary | As students, we all knew the teachers who reliably saw what was happening in the classroom. We talked about their “eyes in the back of their heads,” for example, and we knew when a teacher had them, we were a little more attentive. Other teachers were not so observant, and this often allowed us to be a bit less productive on those days when we were so inclined. Not only was there less accountability in those classrooms, but there was sometimes tacit peer pressure to see how much we could get away with. A slippery slope develops quickly, so good teachers need to see what’s happening in their classrooms. In this lesson, students will learn how to set the stage for success by giving observable directions and scanning the room. (Texas TLaC Online)  This is the first of two lessons on Building Radar. In this lesson, students will learn how to create specific, concrete, and observable directions by analyzing examples of this technique in action and revising a script of directions to be specific, concrete, and observable. | As students, we all knew the teachers who reliably saw what was happening in the classroom.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Watch the following video: Poor Instructions  Analyze the video to determine how well the teacher used specific, concrete, and observable directions. Use the rubric below to provide specific evidence from the video and make suggestions for improvement. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Watch the following video: Poor Instructions  Analyze the video to determine how well the teacher used specific, concrete, and observable directions.

|  | Prior to beginning this lesson, ensure that you can access the following videos:  Building Radar: Doug Lemov & Jabali Sawicki Video: Building Radar: Amy Youngman Video: Building Radar: Rue Ratray |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think about a teacher you had that was very observant and knew exactly what was happening in the classroom at all times. How did their actions impact student behavior? How did this compare to classes where the teacher wasn’t as observant? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Intro to Building Radar: T: In today’s lesson, you are going to learn about radar, a classroom management strategy in which the teacher gives clear, observable directions, visually scans the room, and positions themself to be easily seen by students.  T: Have you ever had a teacher who always knew what students were doing? That’s radar. What does this look like in the classroom?   S: Teacher has “eyes in the back of his/her head,” teacher catches students doing things right and wrong, student can pay attention to all students even when engaged one-on-one with an individual student.  T: How does a teacher with radar impact a classroom?  S: High expectations for behavior, increased accountability, stronger boundaries, students know what is expected of them and are more likely to follow through  S: Review definition of radar.  T: Play the video “Building Radar: Doug Lemov and Jabali Sawicki.”   S: As they watch, students will note key points Doug and Jabali discuss that can help a teacher “see the room” on the Lesson 2.15 Student Guide.   T: What strategies can help the teacher see the room?   S: Make the habit of looking and looking well; Identify blind spots; clear and observable directions; practice beforehand. | Student Guide Video: Building Radar: Doug Lemov & Jabali Sawicki |
| 5 mins | Notes on Building Radar: T: (Display the PPT. Cold call students to read the three keys to seeing the room well.)   S (Read the three keys to “seeing the room” well.) Observable Directions Scanning Pastore’s Perch  S: (Record notes in their 2.15 Student Guide.)  T: Now, we are going to focus on Observable Directions. (Review definition via PPT) Observable directions are clear and concrete directions that allow the teacher to see if students are meeting the expectation(s)  T: If I say, “pay attention” and then deliver a consequence for lack of follow-through, a student might protest, “But I was paying attention.” It is much harder for him to say, “But my pencil was down and my eyes were on you” when they aren’t. As the teacher, I can see clearly whether pencils are down and eyes are on me, and each of my students also knows perfectly well that I can see whether he or she has followed that direction. The clarity of observable directions serves both you and your students.   T: Can you give examples of other common directions you hear from teachers that are NOT examples of observable directions?   S: Be respectful, Try harder, Be ready when the bell rings | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Video Analysis T: (Play the video “Building Radar: Amy Youngman” and “Building Radar: Rue Ratray.”)   T: Listen for clear directions that the teacher can observe. Record this evidence in the student guide.  S: (Record examples of directions in their guide as they watch the video.) | Student Guide Video: Building Radar: Amy Youngman Video: Building Radar: Rue Ratray |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Upgrade the nonexample  T: We’re going to look at a sample of a teacher’s script. Think about if this script gives clear, observable directions.   Script: “Okay, class. Let’s get ready to learn. It is time for us to transition to math.”  S: (Read the script.)  T:  Did the teacher use specific, concrete, and observable directions?   S: No, the teacher was vague in her directions and did not clearly explain what “ready to learn” looks like. She should have provided concrete and observable directions for students to see what it means to be “ready to learn.”  T: Please rewrite the directions to make them specific, concrete, and observable.  T: Swap your revised observable directions with another group. You will read each other’s work and provide feedback using the rubric.   S: (Using the feedback rubric, groups should provide specific feedback on strengths and opportunities for improvement.)  T: (After students receive their work back provide time for groups to make corrections to their revised directions.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief: T: What differences did you notice between the original script of directions versus your revised directions?   S: The new directions were more specific, concrete, and observable. Students knew exactly what they needed to do to be successful.  T: What are important points to remember when providing directions?   S: Being clear, specific, concrete and providing observable directions.  T: Why is it important to provide specific, concrete, and observable directions?   S: It allows students to know exactly what they are expected to do to succeed and provides a way for teachers to accurately determine if students are meeting expectations; less room for confusion; etc. | Student Guide |
