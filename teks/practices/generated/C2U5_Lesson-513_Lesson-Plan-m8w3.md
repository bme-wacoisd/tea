| 4 mins | Bellringer: Match each assessment type to the appropriate scenario on your student guide based on the purpose of the scenario. |  |
| 1 min | T: In previous lessons, we discussed that there are a variety of summative assessments that teachers can utilize to determine student learning against the learning objectives.  This bellringer identified a few that we discussed. T: (Review the answers to the bellringer with students) T: When you think of these types of summative assessments, what do they all have in common? S: They all require a clear set of success criteria in order for teachers to judge student learning. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Introduction to Rubrics and Characteristics of Quality Rubrics T: Today we will discuss ways to structure that success criteria for students and teachers to ensure the greatest chance of success for students and to ensure reliability and practicality of the grading process for teachers. T:  We are going to learn about a tool that can be used in assessment called a rubric.  Have you ever been provided a rubric by a teacher for a project or assignment?  How did it help you to be successful on that assignment? S: (Answers may vary but most students likely have seen a rubric.) A rubric helped me to see what I had to do to get the grade that I wanted on the assignment. T: For an assessment to be effective, it must be fair and transparent, reliable, and practical.  As we discussed in the bellringer and in previous lessons, summative assessments like projects, performance tasks, portfolios, and essays can be more difficult and time-consuming to grade than tests and quizzes.   T: A rubric is a tool used to assess student performance against a set of success criteria for a task.  Rubrics help teachers to be clear about the criteria for grading as well as adding more consistency into the grading process. Rubrics help students to understand the learning targets and the success criteria for the task.   T: Characteristics of Quality Rubrics include: List of specific criteria: Students and raters will clearly know the expectations for the task based on the key criteria identified.  These are the standards by which the task will be rated. Focused on the most important content: the rubric should measure the key skills and knowledge aligned to the instructional objective.   Clearly defined and measurable levels of performance: these represent the level to which the task meets expectations.  Typically, a quality rubric will describe 3-5 levels of performance. Each level of performance will be specifically described.  The more specificity used, the easier it will be to rate, it will be rated more consistently, and students will clearly understand the rating. Reliable: It must be descriptive enough so that various raters will identify the same or similar score. T: Now let’s look at an example of a quality rubric. | PPT Student Guide |
| 7 mins | Practice 1: Example of an Effective Rubric T: Locate Practice 1 in your student guide. You will see that this is a rubric from the PhD Science TEKS. This rubric outlines the success criteria for a performance task with multiple assessment items.  Take 2 minutes to examine the example looking for evidence of the characteristics of a quality rubric. S: (Locate Practice 1 and read rubric for 2 minutes.) T: (Display the rubric from example 1 on the board.) Now that you have had a chance to examine the example of a rubric in Practice 1, let’s identify where we see evidence of the characteristics of a quality rubric. The first characteristic that we identified was that there is a list of specific criteria.  Where on the rubric were the specific criteria outlined? S: In this rubric, the specific criteria is listed under items and standards addressed. T: (Point to the item column on the displayed rubric.) Yes. The item and standards addressed reference the standard to which each item is aligned.  If we wanted to note the specific standard, we could look those up on the science TEKS. T:  The next characteristic is that it is focused on the most important content, meaning key knowledge and skills are aligned to the instructional objective.  Where is that displayed on this rubric? S: The standards addressed for each item indicate alignment to the instructional objective. T: (Point to column with standards on displayed rubric.) Exactly. What about the clearly defined and measurable levels of performance?   S: We can see those are listed at the top of the rubric with the numbers 1 through 4.  T: (Point to the row with numbers 1-4 on the displayed rubric.) Yes, the levels 1-4 show a level of performance from “1-incorrect or unreasonable response with no detail or evidence provided” all the way to “4-Correct or reasonable response with sufficient detail or evidence provided.”  Notice that there are steps or progressions between the 1 and 4 rating that show a continuum of performance. T: The final characteristic is that it is reliable.  How do we know that this rubric will be reliable?  S: There are very clear descriptions under each rating that are specific. It would be easy as a rater to know how to evaluate each question because of it. T: (Point to the information under each rating on the displayed rubric.) Yes, the greater the specificity in the descriptions, the better chance that different raters would evaluate the work the same way, making the rubric more reliable. T: Now let’s look at another example of a rubric.  This one does not have all the characteristics of a quality rubric. | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Practice 2: Non-Example of Effective Rubric T: Locate Practice number 2 on your student guide. Take 2 minutes to review the rubric notating how it aligns, or doesn’t, to the criteria for quality rubrics. S: (Locate Practice 2 and read through the example rubric.) T: In what ways is this rubric NOT an example of a quality rubric?  Do you see a list of specific criteria? S: The rubric lists criteria for rating, but it is not specific.  It does not clearly describe the skills being measured. T: Yes, the rubric writer identified some key points or areas of focus, but it is unclear what each means.  How do we know if this focuses on the most important content? S: I’m not sure.  How would we know that? T: It is tough to know with this rubric because the most important content is determined by the instructional objectives which are not provided here.  They may be provided in a project description, but that isn’t available now.  In the absence of the learning objectives, we could think about what is being evaluated.  Often things like “engaging” and “creativity” don’t align to instructional standards or objectives, so we have a clue but need to know more before deciding if it meets the criteria for most important content. T: What about clearly defined and measurable levels of performance? S: This rubric only allows the rater to include a rating for each criteria but does not describe how to determine the different levels or scores for each criterion. T: Do you think that this rubric would be reliable? Would different raters likely provide the same or similar scores? S: Probably not.  Without clear and specific descriptions of the criteria at different levels, it would be tough for different raters to have similar scores.  Also, things like “engaging” and “creative” and “clarity” are not defined the same by all people. T: So how would you recommend that we improve this rubric?  How could we make it better fit the characteristics of a quality rubric? S: We could start by clearly defining the criteria and making sure it aligns to instructional objectives.  This will make the rubric focus on the most important content. S: We could also create different levels of performance, with descriptions of each level for the criteria. The more specific the descriptions, the better chance it will be reliable. T: Yes, all of those changes would make it better fit the characteristics of a quality rubric. | Student Guide |
| 13 mins | Practice 3: Revising a Rubric to Align to Characteristics of a Quality Rubric T: Now you will get to practice on your own.  In groups of 2, you will examine the example of a rubric shown under “Practice : Revising a Rubric…”  Please locate that section on your student guide now. S: (Locate Practice 3 on student guide.) T: You will first identify in what ways the sample rubric meets the criteria for quality rubrics and in what ways it does not.  Then, determine the feedback that you would provide to improve the rubric to better meet the criteria for a quality rubric.  You will have 10 minutes to complete this task. S: (Work in groups of two for 10 minutes to complete the task.) T: Let’s take a few minutes to share our thoughts.  In what ways does this science fair rubric align to the characteristics of quality rubrics? S: This rubric does have specific criteria and there are defined levels of performance. The descriptions of each level show some specifics to make it easier to reproduce ratings by different raters. T: What suggestions for improvement did you come up with as a group? S: (Answers may vary but could include the following:) Based on the description of the assignment, it does not seem that the rubric focuses on the most important content. The assignment asks students to design, conduct and collect data on a science experiment, producing a display to communicate their work. The rubric should focus on experimental design, data collection, and results of the experiment rather than neatness and completion.  Also, the levels of performance do not seem as descriptive as they could be. Clarifying what a 4 means and a 2 means would be important to students. |  |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: Based on what we talked about today, what is the purpose of a rubric? How does it support teachers and students? S: On assessments where grading requires success criteria and judgement, rubrics can make grading clearer, easier, and more consistent for teachers.  For students, rubrics clearly outline the criteria for success and expectations for performance.  T: We have seen that not all rubrics are created equal.  What characteristics are required for a rubric to be considered quality? S: Quality rubrics have clearly defined criteria for success, specific and measurable, clearly defined, and measurable levels of performance, it is aligned and measures the most important content and is reliable (repeatable by raters). |  |
