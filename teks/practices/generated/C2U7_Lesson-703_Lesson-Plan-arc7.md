| Rationale/ Summary | Attending to the structure and sequence of a lesson has been proven to result in greater student learning. High quality instructional materials include an effective structure, but implementation requires attention to clarity of student expectations, student engagement, and effective transitions. In this lesson, students will be introduced to double planning, a strategy teachers utilize to effectively implement high quality instructional materials with structure and intentionality. | Attending to the structure and sequence of a lesson has been proven to result in greater student learning.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | What are the 3 key considerations for teachers in implementing high quality instructional materials with structure and intentionality?  See the example of a lesson description and double plan below.   Lesson Description:  Students have just read a passage from the book, The Diary of Anne Frank. The students are examining how the narrator uses figurative language in the text to convey meaning. The teacher wants students to talk to each other about what Anne meant when she said, “I thought my days were numbered.”   How does this double plan address the 3 key considerations for implementing high quality instructional materials?

| 5 mins | Bellringer In past units we have discussed the importance of classroom management and considerations for effective sequencing of instruction. Write down all that you remember about these two topics. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Introduction to Structuring Lessons  T: Find the notes section on your student guide.  S: (Locate notes section on student guide.)  T: In prior units, we have discussed the importance of classroom management and sequencing of lessons. What are some of the key points for a teacher to consider regarding classroom management?  S:  Being proactive is important. Building relationships with students, setting high expectations, creating safety, and establishing clear and consistent routines help teachers to manage the classroom effectively.  T: Now, let’s think back to what we know about sequencing of instruction.   S: Lessons should be carefully sequenced to activate students’ prior knowledge and to help them avoid overload. Information in a lesson should build over time from simple to more complex.   T: Yes, that’s right. When we look at the structure of high-quality instructional materials, we should see evidence of these ideas. What are the components of a high-quality lesson plan?  S: They have an introduction, direct instruction, guided & independent practice, assessment, and some type of debrief or closing.   T: Think about the flow of our lessons in this course. How are our lessons typically structured?  S: We start with a bellringer, then move to instruction, have a teacher model, then practice the skill before debriefing/reviewing and closing with an exit ticket.  T:  The high leverage practice of structuring lessons brings together the important parts of classroom management and sequencing instruction. It isn’t just about what students are learning but how they will be learning it. High quality instructional materials structure learning effectively but teachers must attend to implementing the lessons with structure and intentionality.    T:  There are three key considerations for implementing HQIM: Clarity of Student Expectations: Begin with overview/review prior content. This helps to activate student thinking and make connections between past learning and current learning as well as clarify expectations and student success criteria. Effective Transitions: Teachers must maximize the time available for learning. This includes ensuring that transitions between activities are smooth and the teacher structures instructional activities to maximize time on task. Student Engagement: Students should be actively thinking, reading, writing, and talking about their learning throughout the lesson. T:  For a teacher to effectively implement high quality materials, they need to think proactively about the instruction. One strategy that helps teachers do this is double planning. Double planning helps teachers think about what students will do throughout the lesson.  T: I am going to show you a video that describes the double planning process. As you watch the video, think about how the process of double planning can help to improve student learning and take notes in your student guide. What are the benefits?  T: (Show TLAC Double Planning Video-D.Lemov & J.Worrell-2:52)  S: (Students watch video & take notes on the benefits of double planning.)  T:  In what ways do you think double planning can help improve student learning?  S: Double planning can help teachers to clarify their expectations for students (what success looks like). It also could be helpful for teachers to think about how they will give instructions clearly and structure effective transitions as well as how to address student engagement.  T: Let’s look at an example of how to create a double plan. | PPT Student Guide TLAC Video: Double Planning |
| 8 mins | Double Planning  T: Locate the example of a double plan on your student guide.  S: (Locate Double Plan on student guide.)  T: This is an example of a small portion of a lesson. Can someone read the description of the task where it says “Paragraph”?  S: (Volunteer reads description after paragraph on Double plan example.)  T:  Now take a moment to review the steps under “Teacher will” and “Student Will.”  What do you notice?  S: (Answers will vary.) There are a lot more details in the double plan than the paragraph about how the students and teachers will accomplish the task. The double plan highlights the transitions and the small things that teachers need to do (setting timers/planning for timing) that are not clear in the description. It helps to visualize how everything is happening in the classroom.  T: There are a lot of moving parts to planning instruction. You will see that the description mentions “Read the first half on your own.” This could be confusing to students. The double plan clarifies those expectations by asking students to “box the text that you will read.”  Where else do you see expectations clarified by the double plan?  S: The description mentions taking notes while the double plan clarifies that students should be annotating and then starring their best annotations. Also, during the section of sharing, the teacher clarifies that students should “reference your annotations as you talk.”  That clarifies to students that they should be working from the text as they are discussing the prompt.  T:  The double plan helps to ensure student engagement. Where do you see examples of planning for student engagement?  S: Students engage by boxing the text, read along silently, ask a student to read the focus prompt, actively annotate the passage, turn, and talk during a discussion.  T: How does this double plan help to plan for effective transitions? What would a teacher likely not think about if they were working just from the description? S: The double plan shows how much time to be spent on each step. It also reminds the teacher to set a timer to maximize time on task. Without these reminders the teacher may let an activity go too long or cut it off too early and the students may not be clear about how much time they have on a particular task.   T: As you look through this plan, notice that for almost every teacher action there is a student action. Thinking through the plan in this way helps to be proactive about the role of each person. |  |
| 12 min | Student Practice: Double Planning  T: Now it’s your turn to double plan.  Please locate the practice section on your student guide.  S: (Locate practice on guide.)  T:  You have been given a description of part of a 3rd grade ELA class. Below is the double plan chart with the teacher actions already populated. You will have 5 minutes to work on your own to complete the “student will” section of the double plan. After the 5 minutes is up, you will share your thoughts with a partner and discuss how this double plan addresses clarity of expectations, student engagement and effective transitions. (Set timer for 5 minutes.)  S: (Work individually for 5 minutes to complete the “student will” section.)  T: Now, find a shoulder partner to share what you wrote for the student will section and address the questions on your student guide. You will have 5 minutes.  S: (Find a shoulder partner. Share thinking and discuss prompts.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: What were some of the ways that the double plan in your student practice addressed clarifying student expectations, student engagement and effective transitions?  S: For expectations students are prompted to assign a reading passage to read aloud, it clarifies what students should do if they finish reading early, and the importance of citing answers from the text. For engagement, Students are prompted to engage physically to show they are prepared (show book, make eye contact/point to partner, show fingers of which part they will read). For effective transitions, the teacher utilizes familiar routines (shoulder buddy), timers used to maximize time on task, clear instructions provided for students to follow.  T: The high leverage teaching practice of structuring lessons brings together what two concepts that we have studied in the past?  S: Classroom management and sequencing lessons  T:  Why is it important for teachers to consider both teacher actions and student actions in the structure of lessons? What is the impact on learning?  S: Thinking about what students do helps teachers to be more proactive in their teaching. They can anticipate where clarity in expectations is required, how to ensure student engagement and maximize time on task by ensuring effective transitions. All of this results in  more effective student learning. |  |
