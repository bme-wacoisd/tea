| Warm-Up (5 mins)  Bellringer | Instruction (15 mins) Mrs. Smith’s Classroom System (5 mins) Notes: System Cues (10 mins) | Application (20 mins) Planning Your System Cue (10 mins) Debrief (5 mins) Exit Ticket (5 mins) |


| TEKS | 7 | The student creates an effective learning environment. The student is expected to: describe and implement a safe and an effective learning environment that incorporates the principles of universal design; demonstrate teacher and trainer characteristics that promote an effective learning environment identify classroom management techniques that promote an effective learning environment | The student creates an effective learning environment.

| Rationale/ Summary | Investment in classroom systems is worthwhile so students know how to set themselves up for academic success with minimal teacher intervention. Increased student autonomy leads to increased joy and pride. Your goal should be to create an environment in which students are empowered to execute systems with a high degree of independence, thereby allowing you to focus your energy on facilitating learning. In this lesson, students will learn the importance of students owning classroom systems by limiting teacher talk to planned System Cues.   This is the first of three lessons about transferring ownership. In this lesson, students will learn what a System Cue is and what makes a good System Cue, examine an example of a System Cue, and create a System Cue for a scenario. | Investment in classroom systems is worthwhile so students know how to set themselves up for academic success with minimal teacher intervention.

|  | Prior to beginning the lesson, ensure you can access the video Install Your System (Eric Snider) |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Describe a scenario where a teacher, coach, etc. provided the same daily directions for a routine in January that they did in September. What was your response? How did this make you feel? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Scenario: Mrs. Smith’s Classroom System T: Let’s reflect on your bellringer. Who would like to share?  S: (Share out.)  T: Today we’re going to talk about developing System Cues so that students begin to take ownership over routines and procedures with less prompting from the teacher. T: Before we begin, turn to your Student Guide, and find the Scenario for Mrs. Smith’s classroom.  S: (Turn to Scenario in their Student Guide.) T: Read quietly through the transcript and estimate the number of words related to academic content versus the number of words that relate to classroom systems and giving directions. Once you finish reading the scenario, answer the questions below in your Student Guide. S: (Read the scenario and answer questions.) T: Now turn to your neighbor and discuss your answers. S: (Turn and talk.) T: What did you notice about the teacher’s interactions with the students? S: Interactions were joyful and orderly. T: How much time was spent on academic content versus on classroom systems and giving directions? S: 38 words of the 177 words spoken were directly related to academic content.  T: Is this ration of academic content to classroom systems and directions what you would expect in March? S: No. This level of direction is more appropriate for earlier in the school year. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: System Cues T: The key to making the transition from teacher-led systems to student-owned systems is the planning of System Cues.  T: A system cue is an abbreviated direction that reminds students of the steps in the system that they already know. So “Eyes on me in one, two, three” at the beginning of the year may simply be “Eyes” by December.  T: What are some things you notice about the cues you have seen modeled so far?  S: The directions are short/the students understand the system without additional prompting/teachers use unique systems/the cues are consistent to cut down on confusion.  T: We’re going to watch a quick video to see how a teacher, Mr. Snider, prompts his students to Turn and Talk and respond. As you watch the video, take notes in your Student Guide for cues that Mr. Snider uses.  T: (Show “Remove Scaffolding: Eric Snider” to students.)  S: (Take notes.)  T: Now you’re going to turn and talk to a neighbor. What similarities did you notice between Ms. Smith and Mr. Snider’s System Cues? What differences did you notice?  S: (Turn and talk.) | Student Guide Video: Install Your System (Eric Snider) |
| 15 mins | Planning Your System Cue T: In a moment we’re going to move into small groups to plan a System Cue. In your Student Guide find the section “Planning Your System Cue.” To prepare for your group work, take a minute to read through this document. S: (Read Planning Your System Cue.) T: Now you’re going to move into your groups of three. With your partners, discuss the teacher’s use of a System Cue. What did you notice? Is there anything you would do differently? S: (Work together in groups to review Planning Your System Cue.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: How did the teacher replace their directions and narration with a System Cue?  S: The teacher scaffolded the approach by gradually including fewer words in the directions. The teacher also included a mini-roll-out to introduce the System Cue.  T: Why do you think it is important to include a mini-roll-out when introducing a new System Cue?  S: It helps students to know exactly what to expect and what to listen for.  T: Have you experienced routines like this in your classrooms? What is the impact on students? Classroom culture?  S: Answers will vary.  T: Have you experienced classrooms in which the routines did not look like this? What is the impact on students? On classroom culture?  S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide |
