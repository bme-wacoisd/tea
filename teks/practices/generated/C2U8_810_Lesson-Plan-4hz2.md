| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 mins | Bellringer: A teacher down the hall heard you are learning about multiple means of representation and wants to know what that means. Create a 60 second overview (“Elevator Pitch”) of this UDL principle to share with this teacher. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | T: You are going to get into groups of 4. (Count off students 1-4 to randomize groups). In groups, you will each share your 60 second overview of multiple means of representation and make revisions based on what you heard from your group.   S: (Share overview of representation with group) | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Review of Multiple Means of Representation  T: What were the key points you included in your overview of multiple means of representation?  S: Student responses will vary but should reference any of the following:  Multiple means of representation mean presenting information and content in different ways to support learning for all students.  Provide options for perception Offer options for customizing the display of information Offer alternatives for auditory information Offer alternatives for visual information Provide options for language/symbols Clarify vocabulary and symbols Clarify syntax and structure Promote understanding across languages Present key concepts through multiple media Provide options for comprehension Activate background knowledge Highlight patterns, critical features, big ideas, and relationships Guide information processing and visualization Maximize transfer and generalization  T: (Share image via PPT and review key guidelines and strategies for multiple means of representation) | Student Guide  PPT |
| 5 mins | Guided Practice – Lesson Analysis  T: We are going to examine an example lesson plan from the Grade K Module 2 Science Life Unit to find evidence of multiple means of representation. As we go through the lesson plan, we are going to look for evidence of each guideline one-by-one. You will record evidence in the graphic organizer in your student guide. (Provide students with a copy – hard copy and digital if possible).   T: Read page 22 of the lesson plan. As you read, look for evidence of options for perception.  S: (Students read and look for evidence of options for perception.)  T: Where do you see evidence of options for perception?  S: The teacher activates provides a visual map of North America and explains that the highlighted area on the map is the location of the Mojave Desert.   T: Was there any options for perception that you didn’t see? If so, what could the teacher have done to include that strategy?  S: The teacher didn’t offer options for customizing the display of information. The teacher could provide students with the link to the video so they can change the rate of speech or sound, vary the pace and watch it again as needed.  T: Let’s record this evidence on our graphic organizer.  S: (Students record notes in student guide.)  T: Now, read page 22 of the lesson plan again. As you read, look for evidence of options for language and symbol.  S: (Students read and look for evidence of options for language and symbol.)  T: Where do you see evidence of options for language and symbol?  S: The teacher clarifies the meaning of the highlighted area on the map and used a map to locate the Mojave Desert in relation to their own location.    T: Let’s record this evidence on our graphic organizer.  S: (Students record notes in student guide.)  T: Now, read page 22 of the lesson plan for the last time. As you read, look for evidence of options for comprehension.  S: (Students read and look for evidence of options comprehension.)  T: Where do you see evidence of options for comprehension?  S: The teacher activates prior knowledge, provides a visual map of North America, and explains that the highlighted area on the map is the location of the Mojave Desert. The teacher helps students compare their own location with the location of the Mojave Desert.   T: Let’s record this evidence on our graphic organizer.  S: (Students record notes in student guide.) | Kindergarten Lesson Sample “Life in the Mojave Desert”  Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Lesson Analysis Jigsaw – Expert Groups T: Now, you are going to engage in a Jigsaw activity to read the remainder of the lesson plan and look for evidence of multiple means of representation. You will start in groups where you will be an “expert” around one means of representation. Your group’s task will be to look for evidence of just that means of representation.   T:  After you work with your “expert” group, you will work with a “learning” group with members from each of the three expert groups to share your learning.  In your learning groups, you will teach each other what you learned.  T: Finally, we will share with the whole group about what we learned to check for understanding.  T: First we will establish our “learning” groups.  T: (Direct students to create groups of 3 with students sitting close to them.)  T: Within your learning group, count off by threes.   S: (Students count off by threes within learning groups.)  T: (Direct students into 3 expert groups around the room, one for each means of representation: ones going with perception, twos with language and symbols, and threes going with comprehension. If there is a larger class, consider creating two groups for each expert group, such as two groups working on perception, two groups working on language and symbols, etc.)  S: (Students move to their “expert” groups with their student guides and lesson plan.)  T: Read the remainder of the lesson plan, look for evidence of your assigned means of representation and record evidence in your student guide.  S: (Students read the lesson plan for evidence of their assigned means of representation – this will likely take 5 minutes.)  T: Now use the graphic organizer to discuss the multiple means of representation you found and prepare to teach your “learning” group.    S: (Students discuss the guideline and prepare to teach their learning group by discussing the evidence they found.)  T: (Circulate to “expert” groups to support their discussion and preparation.) | Kindergarten Lesson Sample  Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Lesson Analysis Jigsaw – Learning Groups  T: Now that each of you have prepared, we are going to return to our “learning” groups and teach each other what we’ve learned. Please return quickly to your learning group.  S: (Return to their original learning groups.)   T: Starting with perception, experts will share the evidence they found in the lesson plan.  Learners should listen and take notes on each means of representation in their student guide.  T: Each “expert” presenter will have 2 minutes to share the evidence they found. If there are two experts on the same topic, share the duties of teaching your fellow “learning” team members.   T: (Display a two-minute timer for the Perception expert, then two minutes for Language/Symbol expert, and so on).  S: (Experts teach and learners listen and take notes.) | Kindergarten Lesson Sample Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: Let’s collectively review what we learned.   T: What evidence did you see of options for perception?  S: The teacher provides visual of map of North America. Shows a video of Mojave Desert flyover and explains that the highlighted area on the map is the location of the Mojave Desert.  T: What evidence did you see of options for language and symbol?  S: The teacher taught the word desert by pronouncing the word, breaking it into syllables, and sharing photographs of different deserts around the world. The teacher reminded students of the definition for environment – used photograph to help students describe the environment. The teacher showed two students’ science logbook and asks students to think about why the drawing look different even though both students took the same video tour. The teacher provided the Spanish cognate for desert (desierto), provided scaffolds for English Language Learners, and made connection to how many cultures use oral storytelling and song to share observations and information. Students saw information in different formats, such as they went on a video tour, looked at maps, examined photographs and a drawing.  T: What evidence did you see of options for comprehension?  S: The teacher activated background knowledge by having students compare their own location with the location of the Mojave Desert. The teacher asked students what they might see if they were in the Mojave Desert to see what student already know about deserts. The teacher provided tips for how scientist can record their observations. Some use drawings, some use writing, some cultures use storytelling or song. The teacher highlighted student responses that included descriptive details. Students recorded their own observations through drawing/writing in their Science Logbooks recording sheet. The teacher showed two students’ Science Logbooks to have students consider why the drawings look different even though they both took the same video tour – the teacher helped students understand the big idea that students represent things in different ways. The teacher helped guide students through the understanding of the word desert by explicitly introducing the term and breaking it down. The teacher walked students through an example of how one scientist recorded his observations through drawings before students had to record their own in a similar way. Students were able to apply their new knowledge by finding on outdoor environment at home that has a variety of plants and writing or drawing their observations of the environment. T: What did we not see evidence of?  S: Options for customizing the display of information.  T: How could the teacher include options for customizing the display of information?  S: The teacher could provide students with the video link so they can change the rate of speech or sound, vary the pace, and watch the video again as needed.  T: How did the use of multiple means of representation in the example lesson make the lesson accessible to all students and promote a deeper understanding of the concepts?  S: Students were able to visualize the concept in different ways, hear verbal explanations and definitions, and make connections to other languages and cultures. By experiencing the concept in multiple ways, the working memory was engaged in making meaning of and connections between the ideas and concepts.   T: Why is it important to provide multiple means of representation?  S: Learners perceive and comprehend information that is presented to them in different ways. Some students have sensory disabilities, such as blindness or deafness, some have language barriers, and some students comprehend information faster through visual means. There isn’t one means of representation that works for every learner. |  |
