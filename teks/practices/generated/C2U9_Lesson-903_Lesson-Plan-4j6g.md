| Rationale/ Summary | Feedback informs a student and/or teacher about the student’s performance relative to learning goals and outcomes. Creating opportunities for students to receive feedback that is meaningful, specific, and timely allows students to determine their learning strengths and utilize feedback to improve future learning and performance. Formal feedback provides instantaneous feedback to a student to allow for learning to move forward when students are practicing skills. In this lesson students will practice giving formal written feedback by examining student work samples. After providing feedback, students will work together to determine if the feedback they developed is aligned to the characteristics of effective feedback. | Feedback informs a student and/or teacher about the student’s performance relative to learning goals and outcomes.

| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 mins | Bellringer How does formal feedback differ from informal feedback? What are the benefits of formal written feedback over informal verbal feedback? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Review T: What is formal feedback? S: Feedback that is planned into the learning process. It is given to all students after a task is completed. T: When might you choose to use formal written feedback instead of informal verbal? What are the benefits? S: Formal feedback should be given at the completion of a task where informal is given during a task to keep the learning progressing. The benefit to written feedback is that it is recorded for students to go back to, and it is given to all students, not just some. |  |
| 3 mins | Review of Characteristics of Effective Feedback T: We discussed in the previous lesson that feedback can take different forms depending on when it is delivered, how it is delivered, and the purpose for the feedback. Today we will practice giving formal, written feedback. T: Remember that no matter the type given, feedback must align to the characteristics of effective feedback. What are the 4 characteristics of effective feedback that we have discussed? S:  Feedback must be specific and clear, focused on the task not the student, identify both strengths and areas for improvement, and be timely and actionable. | PPT Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Model: Effective Formal, Written Feedback T: In your student guide under “Model” Effective Formal, Written Feedback” you will see an example of a piece of student work. Please locate that example now in your student guide and take three minutes to review the success criteria and the student work included. (Set timer for 3 minutes.) S: (Locate model and read the success criteria and student work.) T: As we consider the feedback to provide, we want to be sure that feedback is: Specific and clear Focused on the task and not the student. Identifies both strengths and areas for improvement. Is timely and actionable. T: Below the student work there is a chart of some examples of effective feedback and some non-examples. Since we want to be sure to include feedback on both strengths and areas of improvement, you can see that the chart includes both. Can I have someone read the examples of effective feedback statements that are listed under strengths? S: (Reads effective feedback statements-strengths from chart.) T: Can someone tell me how these statements meet the criteria for effective feedback? S: The first and second statements are specific in listing the number of details included and number of sentences.  T: Any other thoughts? S: The feedback also tells why the drawing is good by helping to visualize the events. T: Now can someone read the non-examples for strengths? S: (Reads non-examples for strengths from chart.) T: How are these statements different from the effective feedback? S: The statements are not as specific. The first two do not tell how many sentences and details so you do not know why they are good. T: Yes, it is important for students to understand why something is good so that they can replicate it again. Any other thoughts? S: The statement about the title being good is not helpful because you do not know why. Also being a good drawer does not have anything to do with the task.  T: Now I want you to read the examples and non-examples for the areas of improvement. Turn to a neighbor and discuss how these statements meet or do not meet the criteria for effective feedback. (Set timer for 3 minutes.) S: (Discuss the examples and non-examples for areas of improvement.) T: Can I have someone provide a statement and discuss why it is an example of effective feedback based on your partner discussion? S: The statement about improving by adding periods at the end of sentences or thoughts helps the student to recognize how to improve and specifically needs to be changed. T: Can someone provide a non-example statement and why it isn’t effective feedback based on your discussion? S: The statement about not using appropriate punctuation does not tell the student enough about what it is wrong and how can be fixed. |  |
| 20 mins | Practice-Formal, Written Feedback  T: Now you are going to practice giving formal written feedback on student work. Remember, formal feedback is given at the completion of a task and often measures progress toward a set of learning objectives. Please locate Practice-Formal, Written Feedback on your student guide.  S: (Locate the Practice-Formal, Written Feedback section on their student guides.)  T:  You will be given two different examples of completed student work and the success criteria for each task. You will read the example provided and then draft at least three written feedback comments that you would give the student to improve their work. Be sure that you are considering the characteristics of effective feedback when writing your statements.   T: After you have had time to draft your feedback statements individually, you will share your feedback statements with a partner and discuss how the statements drafted meet the characteristics of effective feedback. You will also make any revisions to your statements to better align to the characteristics. There will be two rounds in this practice where you will have 4 minutes to draft feedback and 4 minutes to discuss the feedback with a partner. You will discuss your feedback with a different partner in each round.  T: Locate Feedback Scenario 1 on your student guide. You will have 4 minutes to record at least 3 pieces of feedback for the student work example. Any questions?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: You may begin writing your feedback on scenario 1 now. (Set timer for 4 minutes.)  T: Ok, now you will share your feedback statements with a partner. You will each share your statements and then complete the chart under the example to provide evidence of how they meet the characteristics of effective feedback. You will have 4 minutes for your discussion. You have 30 seconds to find a partner now. (Set timer for 30 secs.)  S: (Find a partner.)  T: Begin sharing your statements and looking for evidence of effective feedback now. If you have time left over, consider how you might revise the feedback statements to better align to the characteristics for effective feedback. Record your notes on your student guide under the practice section. (Set timer for 4 minutes.)  S: (Share feedback with partners. Revise as time allows.)  T: Ok, now let us move on to scenario 2. Individually you will read practice scenario 2, and you will have 4 minutes to write at least three feedback statements on the work. You may begin now. (Set timer for 4 minutes.)  S: (Begin working on scenario 2.)  T: Ok, now let us share our feedback statements with a partner. You have 30 seconds to find a partner. This partner should be different from the partner you worked with in round 1. (Set timer for 30 seconds.)  S: (Find a new partner.)  T: Begin sharing your statements and looking for evidence of effective feedback now for scenario 2. If you have time left over, consider how you might revise the feedback statements to better align to the characteristics for effective feedback. Record your notes on your student guide under the practice section. (Set timer for 4 minutes.)  S: (Share feedback with partners. Revise as time allows.) | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: How did providing formal, written feedback feel compared to the informal, verbal? Was it easier/more challenging? Comfortable or uncomfortable?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Which of the characteristics of effective feedback were the easiest to master?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Which of the characteristics of effective feedback were the toughest to master?  S: (Answers will vary.)    T: How did talking over your feedback with a partner improve your feedback overall?  S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
