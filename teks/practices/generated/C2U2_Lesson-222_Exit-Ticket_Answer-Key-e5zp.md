### Lesson 2.22: Do Not Talk Over

Name:
Date:
Towards the end of the school day, Mrs. Robleque-Chardrum is rushing to get through an important review of the process of photosynthesis ahead of tomorrow’s exam. While she is speaking and referencing a series of images diagraming the process of photosynthesis, students are expected to take notes in their study guides.  However, one student is loudly sharpening her pencil, another student is gathering the class set of folders from each students’ desk, while several other students frequently interrupt to ask questions or share their thoughts without raising their hands and waiting to be called on.  Also, since it’s the end of the day, most of the students begin rustling papers, packing up their backpacks, and engaging in audible background chatter about ten minutes before the bell will ring.  Given the importance of the information and the pending exam, Mrs. Robleque-Chardrum begins speaking faster and louder.
