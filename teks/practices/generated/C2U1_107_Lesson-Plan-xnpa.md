| Rationale/ Summary | This is the first in a series of two lessons that address the concept of designing effective routines. This lesson introduces the concept and specific criteria for effectiveness. Lesson 1.8 provides an opportunity for application and practice as students design their own routine. Effective systems and routines are essential for creating a foundation for instruction and learning. Learning how to design effective systems and routines will set students up for creating safe and effective classrooms. | This is the first in a series of two lessons that address the concept of designing effective routines.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  What kinds of routines do you envision for your own future classroom? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Bellringer Review:  T: Let’s discuss some of the routines you’d like to implement in your future classrooms.   T: (As students share routine examples, ask the class if they think the routine is academic, behavioral, or cultural.)  T: Why do you think it is important for teachers to establish routines?  S: Answers may vary, but might include:  Routines establish classroom norms,  Students know what to expect which promotes positive classroom culture or behavior It makes it easier for the teacher to plan |  |
| 8 mins | Notes: Criteria for Effective Routines—Engineer Efficiency  T: Today, and over the next few classes, we are going to learn more about the characteristics of effective routines.   T: Before we get started, who can remind the class of the definition of routine?  S: Procedures and systems that are automatic and habitual.  T: Great. In our bellringer we discussed routines that you would like to implement in your classroom and why those routines would be important.   T: Effective classroom routines engineer efficiency. The term engineer efficiency means to create a process that decreases the amount of effort needed to complete a task. The best routines don’t require teachers or students to expend energy or time that could be best used on a learning task.   T: There are three criteria around which effective routines are built. They must be simple, well planned (double planned), and minimally narrated.   T: When establishing a routine, it is best to keep that routine simple. The simplest, but correct way, to do something will be easiest for both the teacher and the student to recall and carry out regularly. It is important to use consistent cues that students can recognize and carry out without creating confusion.  T: Think of our classroom routine for beginning class each day. How is our routine simple?  S: (Answers will vary depending on classroom routine)  T: Routines should also be “double planned.” This means that everything that the students as well as the teacher does will be well planned from the beginning to the end of the class period. This also includes knowing in advance which materials will be used and having those materials easily accessible. Double planning is helpful for teachers because it holds them accountable to how their time is being spent as well as establishing clear expectations for what student should be doing.    T: When we begin class how do you know that it is time to start our routine? What am I, as the teacher, doing during that time?  S: (Share out answers)  T: Lastly, routines should be minimally narrated. This means that the teacher’s instructions should be succinct, with the fewest number of directions given. The focus of routine instruction should be on the most important procedural steps so that students do not become confused.  T: Think back to our lesson on What to Do Instructions. How do the concepts introduced in What to Do Instructions might also apply to planning effective routines?  S: What to Do instructions can help teachers create simple and minimally narrated directions that are specific, sequential, and observable.   T: Why is it important for routines to be specific, sequential, and observable?  S: Specific instructions are not vague, so it is clear what the expectation is. Sequencing the routine gives the student an order in which to complete steps. Observable routines ensure the teacher can see that students are on task and allows students unfamiliar with the routine to see what is happening in the classroom. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Reading & Annotation: Systems Planning—Silent Solo  T: We are going to take a few minutes to quietly read the document Systems Planning—Silent Solo. In your Student Guide, take notes of how the Step-by-Step expectations align to the criteria for establishing a routine and how they align with the criteria of What to Do instructions.  S: (Read material and take notes independently in Student Guide) | Systems Planning – Silent Solo (Texas TLAC Online) Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Small Group Discussion: Systems Planning—Silent Solo  T: Now you’re going to get into groups.  T: (Move students into groups of 3-4 using your established classroom routine.)  T: In your small groups, you will participate in a Round Robin activity. This means that you will start with one person in the group who will read one of the notes they just took. After the first student reads one of their responses, the student to their left will read one, and so on until everyone in the circle has had a chance to read. Then the process starts over again until everyone is out of new responses. Once you are out, you can say “Out” so your group knows you do not have a unique response.   T: In the Student Guide, add notes on what your group mates noticed, if different from your own. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let’s look at what you came up with in your groups.   T: How do the Step-by-Step expectations align with the criteria of establishing a routine?  S: The expectations are simple, the routine is double planned, and the instructions are minimally narrated.  T:  How do the Step-by-Step expectations align with the criteria of What to Do Instructions?   S: The teacher was able to prompt the students through the routine by using specific, clear directions. The routine is sequential and observable.  T: Routines are important for students of all ages. Teachers in elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools need to have routines in their classes that create a safe environment where learning can take place. Today, we discussed how teachers engineer efficiency by using three criteria for establishing effective routines. |  |
