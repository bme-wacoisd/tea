| Rationale/ Summary | Positive reinforcement is an important tool to build student morale and motivation. Positive reinforcement communicates to students that they’ve been successful and should continue to do more of that behavior. Some teachers use a more structured approach to motivate and reward students for following expectations. This type of behavior management system is a reinforcement-based system that acknowledges and rewards students for positive behaviors.   This is the last of two lessons on behavior management systems. In this lesson, students will identify the components of classroom reward systems such as sticker charts and computer-based behavior management systems. Students will engage in a reading and role play activity to identify and describe the benefits and drawbacks of classroom reward systems. | Positive reinforcement is an important tool to build student morale and motivation.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will respond to the following questions: Which of the following are components of a classroom behavior system? Which of the following is NOT a potential drawback to classroom reward systems? What are potential benefits to using a classroom reward system? Define extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Which is more likely to promote long-term impact and why? How can a teacher use Radar; clear, specific, observable directions; and nonverbal interventions to help foster a successful classroom behavior system? See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Students will respond to the following questions: Which of the following are components of a classroom behavior system?

| Vocabulary | Positive Reinforcement | Positive Reinforcement | Feedback to students that follows a desired behavior and increases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated. |
| Vocabulary | Behavior Management System | Behavior Management System | A reinforcement-based system that acknowledges and rewards students for positive behaviors. |
| Vocabulary | Classroom Reward System | Classroom Reward System | A system where students earn tangible rewards by exhibiting targeted behaviors. |
| Vocabulary | Targeted Behavior | Targeted Behavior | The discrete behaviors that are explicitly taught and reinforced. |
| Vocabulary | Tangible rewards | Tangible rewards | Items such as stickers, dollars, toys, etc. that students can earn for exhibiting targeted behaviors. |
| Vocabulary | Intrinsic Motivation | Intrinsic Motivation | Behavior is driven by internal rewards, such as pleasurable feelings, personal satisfaction, enjoyment, etc.  You don’t expect anything in return. |
| Vocabulary | Extrinsic Motivation | Extrinsic Motivation | Behavior is driven by external or tangible rewards, such as toys, food, etc. or to avoid punishment |

|  | Prior to beginning the lesson, establish how students will access the article: Understanding Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation in the Classroom: What’s the Magic Formula? |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Create a concept map to show your understanding of behavior management systems and how/why they work. | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Turn and Talk: T: While the students are working, give out some kind of reward (i.e., stickers, points, etc.) to students who are working.   T: Now turn and talk to compare your concept map with a partner.   S: (Compare responses with a partner.)  T: What are some of the key ideas about behavior management systems that you and your partner discussed?   S: Answers will vary but should reflect learning from previous lessons. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Reading T: We mentioned intrinsic and extrinsic motivation briefly in the previous lesson. We are going to read an excerpt to dig deeper into intrinsic and extrinsic motivation today. As you read, respond to the questions in your student guide.   S: Read, Understanding Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation in the Classroom: What’s the Magic Formula? by Elizabeth Mulvahill and respond to the questions in the 2.25 student guide.  T: Based on the reading, what is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation?  S: Intrinsic is internal and based on a person’s individual feelings of what brings them pleasure and satisfaction for themselves. External is more about external rewards.   T: What might be some potential drawbacks to using a classroom reward system or a system that focuses on extrinsic motivation?  S: Extrinsic rewards offered through a classroom reward system can provide only short-term effects. Students might become dependent on the reward and lose their effect and their might be increased peer pressure.   T: Since there are potential drawbacks to external systems, how can teachers help build intrinsic motivation?  S: Teachers can get to know their students and build relationships with them, give them ownership and autonomy, explicitly teach skills, practice goal-setting with effective feedback and make learning relevant. | Student Guide Article: Understanding Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation in the Classroom: What’s the Magic Formula? |
| 10 mins | Notes on Benefits & Drawbacks T: (Use PPT to teach and reinforce benefits and drawbacks of reward systems.)  Benefits of classroom reward systems: Positive behavior is reinforced Promotes positive and appropriate behavior Increased motivation Can provide a way for parents to track student behavior  Drawbacks of classroom reward systems:  Focuses on extrinsic motivation – behavior is driven by external rewards, such as toys, food, etc., opposed to intrinsic motivation - behavior that is driven by internal rewards, pleasurable feelings, enjoyment, etc.   Lacks specific feedback Can be difficult to manage over time Students become dependent on the reward Rewards become an expectation and lose their effect Increased pressure Potentially time-consuming for teachers (can detract from learning) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Role Play Scenario T: Break students into groups of 4 and give each student a role card. Students must not share their role card with anyone else in the group.   S: (Role play a scene from a 3rd grade class where the teacher is currently teaching the students a lesson on adding two 3-digit numbers. Exhibit specific behaviors and respond according to the information provided on their role cards.)  Roles cards: Teacher You are teaching a 3rd grade class a lesson on adding two 3-digit numbers. Use the following script and questions to guide the role play. Use a token system where students are given a token when they are exhibiting the targeted behavior. Script: Introduce the lesson by asking students to help Mitchell. “Mitchell asked if we could help him. He had $350. He earned $125 more. Mitchell wants help deciding how much money he has now. Today, we will learn to add two 3-digit numbers. For example, we will learn how to add 350 and 125 to help Mitchell.” “Mitchell had $350. He earned $125 more. How much money does Mitchell have now?” I want each of you to take a moment to try to solve this problem independently. (Observe for students who are exhibiting positive behaviors.) “What operation did we use to determine how much money Mitchell has now?” “Who would like to come up to the board and model how to write the equation for this problem?” Actions: Continuously give student #1 tokens for actively participating Take tokens away from student #2 when they misbehave Do not give student #3 any tokens even if they are doing the right thing. Keep your focus on student #1 & student #2 Student #1 You are a student who responds to rewards Actions – You are on task and actively participating Student #2 You are a student who responds as rewards are taken away Actions – You are throwing your pencil in the air, pulling papers out of the desk, and not paying attention to the teacher Student #3 You are a student who does not get rewards or punishments and feels left out. Actions – You are task and participating  As students practice in their groups, circulate from group to group to provide feedback. Share feedback based on trends with the whole class between rounds. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief:  T: Bring students back as a whole group and debrief using the following questions as a guide:  T: How did it feel to be the teacher?   S: Responses will vary  T: How did it feel to be the student in each role?   S: Responses will vary   T: What were the strengths of the classroom reward system?   S: The teacher immediately rewarded students for positive behavior; the students being rewarded felt a sense of motivation  T: What were the drawbacks to the classroom reward system?   S: The teacher focused rewards on particular students and missed rewarding other students for targeted behaviors; the teacher took aware tokens from the student who wasn’t following directions, further feeding into the negative behavior; etc. |  |
