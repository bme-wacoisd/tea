| Rationale/ Summary | People tend to be motivated by the positive far more than the negative. It is important to guide students to do better while motivating and inspiring them to evaluate their effort by redirecting them in ways that communicate trust and maintain privacy. In this lesson, students will learn about Positive Framing to frame interactions, particularly corrections, in a way that reinforces trust, while still guiding students toward a better course of action.   This is the last of two lessons on Positive Framing: Motivate Effort and Excellence. In this lesson, students will learn how to Talk Aspirations by analyzing examples of this technique in action and drafting an aspiration statement for a scenario. | People tend to be motivated by the positive far more than the negative.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Use what you’ve learned to craft a Challenge or Talk Aspirations statement (or a combination of both) for the following scenario:  Students have been completing independent work diligently, and there are four minutes to go. You want them to persist until the time is up. Inspire their best effort with Talk Aspirations.  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Use what you’ve learned to craft a Challenge or Talk Aspirations statement (or a combination of both) for the following scenario:  Students have been completing independent work diligently, and there are four minutes to go.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Why is it important to know your students’ goals? How do you learn about your students’ goals and dreams? | Student Guide |
| 13 mins | Intro to Talk Aspirations:  Remember that there are six rules of Positive Framing.  (Display the PPT).  Live in the Now Assume the Best Allow Plausible Anonymity Narrate the Positive and Build Momentum Challenge! Talk Expectations and Aspirations  T: Today, we are going to focus on how to Talk Aspirations to motivate and inspire students. T: Think back to the scenario we role played yesterday with Ms. Wood and Kayla.   T: How could the language Ms. Wood used help motivate Kayla?  S: A lot of people think of math as being a difficult subject, so when Kayla heard that she sounded like “a mathematician,” she could have been motivated to continue working hard in math class.  T: What if Kayla had previously told Ms. Wood that she wanted to be a mathematician when she grew up. How might Ms. Wood saying, “Now you sound like a mathematician” have inspired her differently?  S: Ms. Wood would be making a connection to what Kayla was doing to a future goal.   T: Right. When we connect students to their personal or future goals, we’re using Talk Aspirations, which motivate students to sustain or improve their performance by talking to them about who they are striving to become.   T: When you use Talk Aspirations, you communicate your belief in students’ potential and connect the daily work of the classroom with their goals and dreams. You challenge a fourth grader with, “Good answer. Now let me hear you make it a fifth-grade answer by using the word ‘profit.’” To your science students, you say, “Solid response. But how would Neil deGrasse Tyson say it?” You inspire your AP French Language and Culture students by pushing them to speak like they’re in Paris, or Quebec City, or Dakar.     Notes on Talk Aspirations  T: (Display the PPT) We’re going to discuss how to effectively use Talk Aspirations. You should record the success criteria in your student guides. (Cold call students to read each definition)  S: (Student volunteers read success criteria and all students record success criteria in student guides.)  Motivate students: Communicate your belief in students’ potential and connect the daily work of the classroom with their goals and dreams. Maintains Economy of Language: Using fewer words helps students to focus on what they need to do to meet expectations and brings everyone back to the lesson as quickly as possible. Maintains Emotional Constancy: Use a neutral tone when delivering redirections of any kind. T: Which success criteria stands out? Why?  S: (Turn and talk to share answers)  T: Talk Aspirations can be used in a variety of moments and in all content areas. (Review moments and content area examples using the PPT.)  To encourage students to sustain effort they are demonstrating (e.g., “Authors like us, who are learning to craft intriguing openings...”) To inspire them to tackle a challenge (e.g., “You’re Usain Bolt. Make this sprint your fastest yet.”) To connect the seemingly mundane moments to the big picture of where students are heading and who they’re becoming (e.g., “Just like an architect, try to do this square footage calculation in your head.”)  T: Can you think of other moments or contents where Talk Aspirations would be useful?  S: Answers will vary.  T: Much like Challenge, Talk Aspirations is most effective when you use Economy of Language and a positive delivery.  What impact could Talk Aspirations have on student to teacher relationships?  S: It could have a positive impact because the teacher shows that they care about the students’ goals.   T: When teachers acknowledge students’ potential and connect the work directly to students’ goals, students feel known. When students feel known, they are inspired to meet their potential.  T: Let’s Think-Pair-Share. I will pose a question and give you a minute to think and respond individually in your student guide. Then, if you are in an odd row, turn to the person behind you and share your answers.  T: In order for a teacher to effectively use Talk Aspirations, what must they do first? ((Provide time for students to consider the question on their own.)   S: (Respond individually on their student guides.)  T: Turn and share with your partner.   S: (Discuss with a partner).   T: (Ask for pairs to share their insights with the whole class).   S: (Answers will vary but should include reference to the importance of getting to know your students and talking with students about their goals and aspirations.) | Student Guide |
| 7 mins | Practice 1: Video Analysis T: Now we are going to watch a short video of how Mr. Burmeister motivates his class to get into place.   T: (Show “Motivate Effort and Excellence: John Burmeister”. Pause before Darryl begins to break down the video).   T: Before we talk about this clip as a class, fill in the two questions in your Student Guide under Practice 1: Analyze Challenge in Action.  T: How does the teacher motivate his students?   S: He asks who is ready for Broadway, he says “places” indicating their desire to be an actor on Broadway.  T: What did you notice about how the students responded to Mr. Burmeister’s request?  S: Answers will vary but may include: they were eager to stand up, didn’t slouch, didn’t take their time, etc.  T: (Play the video to show Darryl’s break down.)  T: How have your teachers motivated you?  S: (Share out about their own experiences with teacher motivation.) | Student Guide  Video: “Motivate Effort and Excellence: John Burmeister” (Texas TLAC Online) |
| 5 mins | Practice 2: Upgrade the Non-Example T: Work on your own to revise a statement to make it an example of Talk Aspirations. Find the statement and record your response in your student guide. Remember to use Economy of Language as you develop your statements and be prepared to practice with a partner. |  |
| 5 mins | Practice 3: Delivering Talk Aspirations T: Now you are going to partner up with someone to practice your statement. Let’s review the success criteria. (Remind students of the success criteria in their notes.)  T: You will now role play your scenario with your partner One of you will play the “teacher” role while the other is the “student.” The person in the “teacher” role will use the Talk Aspiration statement they drafted earlier to motivate and inspire the student. Use the feedback rubric your 2.9 Student Guide to provide specific feedback to your partner on the alignment to the success criteria.  S: (Practice and provide feedback with a partner. |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Now that you have had time to draft and deliver your statements, how did you and your partner use economy of language and positive tone and body language when delivering your Talk Aspiration? (Call on volunteers and non-volunteers to respond.)  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: How can building a relationship with students help a teacher develop Talk Aspirations?   S: Before a teacher can effectively use Talk Aspirations, they must first learn what motivates students, what they are striving for, etc.; Talk Aspirations needs to be personalized and that can only be accomplished through getting to know your students.  T: What are important points to remember when creating a Challenge or Talk Aspiration statement?   S: Economy of language, positive tone and body language, get to know your students. |  |
