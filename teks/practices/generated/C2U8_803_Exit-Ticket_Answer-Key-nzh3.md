Read the following scenarios and determine which is more likely to foster student engagement. Explain your reasoning and tell why the use of multiple forms of engagement is important to student learning.

Scenario 1: Ms. C. is about to begin a unit on animals and their life cycles. She asks students to vote on which animal they would like to learn more about. The top 3 votes in the room were frogs, horses, and snakes. Ms. C. begins preparing a unit on animal life cycles focusing on frogs, horses, and snakes.  She plans to take her students on a field trip to the local children’s museum where they can learn more about these different animals. Afterwards, she has students create a class book to explain what they learned about each animal and its life cycle. At the end of the project, Ms. C. ask students to share one important thing they learned.
Scenario 2: Mrs. H. is also beginning a unit on animals and their life cycles. She asks students to choose an animal they would like to learn more about during this unit and decide if they would like to work individually or with a partner. Mrs. H. provides students with a playlist of tools and resources on various levels that they can use to learn more about their chosen animal, such as books, videos, photographs, podcasts, etc. Mrs. H. plans to give students a choice in how they present their learning on their animal, either through a brochure, video presentation, poster, PowerPoint or model. At the end of the project, Mrs. H. ask students to reflect on their learning through an “I use to think… Now I think…” prompt to share how their understanding of life cycles progressed from the beginning of the unit to now.
Which scenario is more likely to foster student engagement and why? Explain your reasoning.
Scenario two is more likely to support student engagement because the teacher provides students with choice in the animal they would explore, how they would work, and the tools and resources they would use to learn more about their animal and its life cycle. The tools and resources where on various levels to allow all students to engage in the learning. Students also had a choice in how they would present their learning.  At the end of the unit, students had reflected on their learning to see their progress over the course of the unit.
Why is the use of multiple forms of engagement important to student learning?
Students differ in what engages their interests, in what motivates them to learn, and in what attracts their attention. There isn’t one means of engagement that will work for every learner in every context. If a student isn’t attending to the content, they cannot cognitively engage, which means they aren’t going to learn.
