| Rationale/ Summary | As students, we all knew the teachers who reliably saw what was happening in the classroom. We talked about their “eyes in the back of their heads,” for example, and we knew when a teacher had them, we were a little more attentive. Other teachers were not so observant, and this often allowed us to be a bit less productive on those days when we were so inclined. Not only was there less accountability in those classrooms, but there was sometimes tacit peer pressure to see how much we could get away with. A slippery slope develops quickly, so good teachers need to see what’s happening in their classrooms. In this lesson, students will learn how to set the stage for success by giving observable directions and scanning the room. (Texas TLaC Online)  This is the last of two lessons on Building Radar. In this lesson, students will learn about Scanning and Pastore’s Perch as effective and proficient ways to monitor students by analyzing examples of these techniques in action and planning and delivering directions using Radar. | As students, we all knew the teachers who reliably saw what was happening in the classroom.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Analyze the scenario below to determine how well Ms. Mason used the Radar technique. Use the rubric below to provide specific evidence from the scenario to support your response and make suggestions for improvement.  Ms. Mason is teaching a science lesson. Ms. Mason instructs her class by saying, “please find the rock sample labeled #1 and place it in front of you.”  As she does so, she glances down, using the moment just after her direction to double-check her notes and glance at her watch to see how she’s doing for time.  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Analyze the scenario below to determine how well Ms. Mason used the Radar technique.

|  | Prior to class, create a list of possible scenarios for students to choose from if they are struggling to come up with a scenario of their own. (Example Scenarios: morning routine, transitioning to group work, transitioning to a new lesson, putting away materials, group talk, etc.)  Ensure you can access the following videos:  Building Radar: Kerri Rizzolo Building Radar: Patrick Pastore |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Read the following scenario and rewrite the script to include specific, concrete, and observable directions.   Scenario: “Good morning! Please follow our morning procedures as you enter the class and get started on your bellringer.” | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Intro to Building Radar T: (Review the importance of providing observable directions.)   T: Why are observable directions important?   S: They help students know what is expected of them and they help a teacher hold students accountable.   T: What else does a teacher need to do to “see the room” well?   S: Teachers need to scan the room and teachers can use “Pastore’s Perch.”  T: (Review definitions for scanning and Pastore’s Perch).  T: In our last lesson, we focused on providing specific, concrete, and observable directions. Today, we will focus on Scanning and Pastore’s Perch. After giving observable directions, a teacher should scan the room to ensure students follow those directions. Let’s see what that looks like. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Video Analysis T: (Show the video “Building Radar: Kerri Rizzolo.”)  S: (As they watch, students will focus on how Kerri scans the room and record their observations on the 2.16 Student Guide.)   T: (After the video, provide time for students to engage in a Think-Pair-Share about the questions in the Student Guide.)   T: Take a minute to finalize your responses to the questions in the Student Guide.  S: (Students should finalize their responses in their student guide.)   T: Turn to the person sitting next to you. If you are in an even row, turn to your right. If you are in an odd row, turn to your left. Discuss your answers with your partner.    S: (Students turn to a partner and discuss their responses.)  S: Kerri gave specific directions – “pencils down in 3,2,1”. Immediately after giving instructions, she scanned the room to ensure all students were following her instructions  S: Looking consistently and intentionally is the first step to seeing, it prevents blind spots  T: (Transition to a whole group discussion around the questions.) Who would like to share something they heard their partner say?   S: (Share answers with the whole class.) | Student Guide Video: Building Radar: Kerri Rizzolo |
| 10 mins | Notes on Pastore’s Perch T: Another key action needed to “see the room” well is Pastore’s Perch. (Share the following information from Texas TLaC Online verbally or via PPT.)   Where you stand when you scan will greatly affect the percentage of the room you can see. In this next video, we are going to see two teachers build their Radar by observing from the corner of the room (Kerri did it too). We call that Pastore’s Perch.  T: Now, let’s see this strategy in action. (Show  the video “Building Radar: Patrick Pastore.”)  S: (As they watch, students will observe how each teacher implements Pastore’s Perch.)  Modeling Pastore’s Perch  T: (During this discussion, use a projector, document camera, or other tool to model note-taking for students.)  S: (Students should take notes on Pastore’s Perch in their student guide during this discussion.)  T: What makes moving to Pastore’s Perch so helpful?   S: The teacher can see more of the room.   T: (Model a scenario to explain why Pastore’s Perch is so helpful)  T:: Imagine you’re Patrick and you want to scan your classroom from the front of the room. To see all students, you would have to scan a field of about 150 degrees. That’s a broad scan. But if you merely walk to the corner of your room, you can see all students by scanning a visual field of just 80 degrees.  T: (Share the following graphic from Texas TLaC Online via PPT)  T: What do you notice about the two images?  S: There are fewer desks in the yellow section without Pastore’s Perch.  T: How does scanning from the front of the room compare to scanning via Pastore’s Perch?   S: When scanning from the front of the room, you have blind spots where you cannot easily observe students. With Pastore’s Perch, the teacher can easily see all students with a short movement of the head. | Student Guide Video: Building Radar: Patrick Pastore PowerPoint |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Plan & Deliver   T: You are going to work in groups of 3 to practice Radar and Pastore’s Perch in rounds. Use your student guide to guide each round of practice.  T: (Divide students into groups of 3.)  S: (Students will plan a specific, concrete, and observable direction for a common scenario in the classroom - morning routine, moving into group work, group discussions, packing up, transitioning to a new activity, etc.)  T: In round 1, you will practice delivering the specific, concrete, observable directions you planned. You have four minutes to complete round 1 and discuss feedback. (Set timer for four minutes.)  S: (In rounds, each group member will practice delivering their directions utilizing Radar and Pastore’s Perch. While each person presents, the group members will observe and provide feedback using the 2.16 Feedback Rubric. After all students have practiced, the group will discuss feedback.)   T: (As students practice in their groups, circulate from group to group to provide feedback. Share feedback based on trends with the whole class between rounds.)  T: Now, it’s time for round 2. In this round, you will practice delivering your directions while scanning. You have four minutes. (Set timer for four minutes.)  S: (Practice delivering directions while scanning. While each person presents, the group members will observe and provide feedback using the 2.16 Feedback Rubric. After all students have practiced, the group will discuss feedback.)  T: We’ll finish up with round 3. In this round, you will deliver your directions, move to Pastore’s Perch, and scan from there. You have four minutes. (Set timer for four minutes.)  S: (Complete final round. While each person presents, the group members will observe and provide feedback using the 2.16 Feedback Rubric. After all students have practiced, the group will discuss feedback.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: How does Radar promote an effective learning environment?  S: Observable directions make it clear and concrete for students what they need to do to be successful and make it much easier for the teacher to see accurately if students are meeting the expectations. Teachers hold students accountable through scanning and teachers save time and energy by observing from the corner.  T: What differences did you notice between your practice in Round 2 vs Round 3?   S: (Responses will vary.) |  |
