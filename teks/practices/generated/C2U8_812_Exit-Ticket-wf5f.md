Return to the bellringer scenario.
Ms. C. just finished a lesson on insects and assigns students a brochure to show what they learned. The brochure must include information and pictures. One student in the class struggles with writing and although she learned a great deal about insects and can elaborately explain her learning, her teacher thinks she has a lack of knowledge and didn’t master the task because she struggled to create her brochure.
Based on what you learned in this lesson, what are some additional ways the teacher might find out what this student knows about insects?
