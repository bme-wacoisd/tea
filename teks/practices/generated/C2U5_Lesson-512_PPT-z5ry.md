### Bellringer

- In most of your classes, you take pencil and paper assessments regularly. Perhaps you take Friday quizzes and/or have big tests at the end of units that take all or most of a class period.
- Take the pre-assessment on your student guide about pencil and paper assessment practices and be ready to talk about your thinking on each of these questions.

| --- | --- |
| Summative | Assessments that are used at the end of a learning sequence to determine to what extent students met the learning objectives; evaluative |
| Assessment Development | Designing and writing a summative pencil and paper assessment to accurately measure learning |
| Administration | Giving the assessment to ensure accurate results |
| Scoring | Determining which questions were answered correctly and which were not and using that to determine an overall grade or assessment score |

## Slide 5

### Development


| Development - Designing and writing a summative pencil and paper assessment to accurately measure learning. |  |
| --- | --- |
| No Surprises | The questions you ask should align to content you taught. |
| Take it yourself | Taking the test yourself can help you make sure you the wording of the questions are clear and determine how long it will take. |
| Vary the question challenge | Some questions can focus on basic facts and recall and some questions should require deeper cognitive engagement. |
| Format with space and clarity | Anything that makes it harder for students to record their thinking (such as too little space for a written response) can make it hard for students to show what they know. |
| Clear directions and scoring | Always make sure it is clear exactly what you want students to do on the test and how many points each section of the test is worth. |

## Slide 6

### Administration


| Administration - Giving the assessment to ensure accurate results. |
| --- |
| Ensure that the classroom has as few distractions as possible. This should mean students themselves should be silent during the assessment, outside noises are minimized, and distracting visual content is avoided (computer screen blanked, white board notes erased) |
| The purpose of assessment is for both the teacher and student to know how the student is progressing to help learning – it isn’t to make long-term judgements or to compare students.  No single test is an accurate measure of how smart a student is but instead a measure of how well they learned the content taught. |
| Generally, it can be helpful to provide students opportunities to retake tests so they have another opportunity to show their work.  Some teachers may choose to not allow retakes if they think retakes are causing students to postpone learning. |

## Slide 7

### Scoring

- 7

| Scoring - Determining which questions were answered correctly and which were not and using that to determine an overall grade or assessment score. |  |
| --- | --- |
| Score with feedback | Sometimes marking questions right or wrong is feedback enough; other times it can be very helpful to be more specific to tell the student where they could improve their work. Putting a C+ at the top of an essay is best when paired with descriptive feedback (e.g. “This paragraphs cites no evidence for your claim. You could make your writing stronger by adding clear textual evidence.”) |
| Look whole class patterns to guide instruction | Often, on a test, you may see a particular question that many students got wrong.  This can help inform what should be retaught and practiced more in the whole class. |
| Intervene for struggling students | When individuals or groups of students struggle, this is your que as a teacher to figure what you can do to help them and to understand why they are struggling and help them take the steps to learn the content. |
