| What are the three key criteria for designing routines? | How does each help create a safe and effective classroom environment? |
| --- | --- |
| Routines should be kept simple. | Simple routines allow students to carry out expectations without confusion, so they know that they are doing what is expected of them. |
| Double-Planning | Double-planning establishes what the student AND the teacher are doing. This helps the teacher to maximize time management and establishes clear expectations for how everyone in the class will be spending their time. |
| Minimal Narration | Minimal narration means that teachers are prompting routines in few words. This cuts down on the number of instructions a student must process at one time, decreasing opportunity for confusion. |
