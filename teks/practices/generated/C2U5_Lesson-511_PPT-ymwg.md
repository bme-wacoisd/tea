### Exit Ticket

- A colleague has shared his draft lesson plans for an upcoming English unit.  He has asked you to provide him some on his summative assessment as you have been working with him to develop more align assessments.  Below are details that he has included regarding his end of unit assessment.

- Demonstrate the understanding of English grammar
- Demonstrate understanding of English conventions
- Assessment Description:
- Students will be given a test with multiple choice questions to complete based upon details from a recent text they read called Things Fall Apart.  The questions will measure knowledge about key characters in the text, theme, and central idea.  There will be a matching section of the text where students will match quotes from the text to the characters who said those quotes.  They will provide a brief description of why those quotes were important.
