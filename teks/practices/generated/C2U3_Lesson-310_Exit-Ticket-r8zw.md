### Lesson 3.10: Using Information About Students from Families to Make Instructional Decisions

Name:
Date:
Consider the following scenario:
During a round of family interviews conducted at the beginning of the school year, Mr. Taylor learned that Denise has a strong preference for working with a partner.  Her parents also shared that she is a hard worker but struggles in math.  Her mother is in the military and is often away from home for long stretches.  Her father is a nurse at the local hospital.  They’ve only lived in town for two years, but really enjoy the area and spend a lot of time exploring all of the family friend options offered within the community.  Outside of school, she loves Disney movies and butterflies.  One day, when Mr. Taylor noticed that Denise seemed very sleepy during class, he called and spoke with her father.  In his family communication tracking log, Mr. Taylor noted that Denise’s father told him that Denise did not get much sleep the previous night because his usual childcare had fallen through, and he had to take Denise to work with him for several hours.  He did, however, share that Denise also wants to be a nurse when she grows up, already knows and understands a lot about the profession, and plays nurse with the family pets.

- Analyze the data from the family interview and family communication tracking log to determine what you know about Denise and her funds of knowledge.



- Using data from the family interview and family communication tracking log to learn more about Denise and the funds of knowledge she brings to the classroom, select and justify an instructional decision.
