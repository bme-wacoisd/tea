| 5 mins | Bellringer: Today we are going to practice teaching a lesson. You will each get a chance to be the teacher and to be the student. In preparation for teaching this lesson, it is important that we discuss and set norms for how we will participate in rehearsal as both teachers and students.   Norms are agreements adopted by a group for how it will do something together and/or behave together. In this case, they are norms for rehearsal teaching.  Look at the proposed norms for the teacher and the role-playing students.  Suggest any additional norms that you would add to these lists. T: (Project norms from student guide on board) | Student Guide |
|  | T: Do you have any question about what these norms mean for how you participate in lesson rehearsal? S: (Raise questions.) T:  (Clarify or answer student questions.) T: Are there any additional norms that you would suggest making the rehearsal experience successful? S: (Students may suggest additional norms.) T: (Add norms to the list on the white board or projected.) T: The last step of norm-setting is to ensure that everyone can agree to these norms.  By giving me a thumbs up, can everyone agree to following these norms during rehearsal? S: (Students agree to norms.) T: Great – now let’s practice our lessons. |  |
| 5 mins | Set-up for practice   T: (Set up stations around the room – a number to accommodate groups of three and, if possible, give each triad access to a section of white board.  Alternatively, students can use a personal white board, projected computer, or even a sheet of paper for sections of the lesson that involve writing).   T: Today we are going to practice the lessons you prepared to teach yesterday. I will divide you into groups of three around the room. You will get to teach your lesson to two of your classmates who have not seen your lesson.  T: (Break students up into groups of three so that each student in the group has a different lesson; ensure that students take their lesson materials when they move into groups. If you have allowed students to select a lesson of their choice, you may have a few groups that have duplicate lessons).  S: (Students move into groups of three.)  T: (Share the PPT.) Our time will be broken up in the following way:  Rehearsal Plan 9 minutes to teach the lesson with other two classmates acting as students. 4 minutes to record reflections on your experience, using either the teacher reflection table or the student reflection table in your student guide. 2 minutes to share warm and cool feedback with the teacher. 2 minutes for the teacher to reflect on teaching the lesson.  T: Please take a second to look at the teacher reflection table and the student reflection table in your student guide.  S: (Students turn to student guides.)  T: During step two in the process – after the lesson is taught – both the teacher and the student will reflect on three elements: The directions, the direct instruction and the opportunities for practice and formative assessment. You will record what went well and what could have been better in each of those three focus areas before you share in steps 3 and 4.   T: Deliberate practice is spaced over time - that is teachers ask students to return to practice skills you have already been taught. It helps cement them in your long-term memory. In earlier units you experienced role playing giving clear directions.  While this unit has not been about giving directions, we give you another chance to practice and get feedback in these lessons.  T: As a teacher, one of the most powerful learning experiences is to observe and be observed by other teachers.   T: As we begin, please remember our norms for the rehearsal.

| 17 mins | Round One: Practice Teach  T: (Display timer with 9 minutes giving the first “teachers” a chance to teach their lesson using the above timing.)  T: Begin teaching your lesson!  S: (Students engage in lesson rehearsal.)  T: (At 9 minutes, teacher stops the rehearsing teachers.)  T: Now, let’s move to 4 minutes to record reflections in your teacher table or the student table in your student guide.  S: (Students reflect in their guides for 4 minutes.)  T: Now I would ask those of you who participated as students to share some of the warm and cool feedback with your teacher.  Be as specific as possible.  S: (Students share warm and cool feedback for the teacher.)  T: Finally, let’s give the teacher a chance to share their reflections on the experience of teaching the lesson.  S: (“Teacher” shares their reflection on the lesson.) |  |
| 17 mins | Round Two Practice Teach  T: Now we are going to transition to our second round of practice.  Please select which teacher will go next in your group.  T: (Display timer with 9 minutes giving the second “teachers” a chance to teach their lesson using the above timing.)  T: Begin teaching your lesson!  S: (Students engage in lesson rehearsal)  T: (At 9 minutes, teacher stops the rehearsing teachers.)  T: Now let’s move to 4 minutes to record reflections in the teacher table or the student table in your student guide.  S: (Students reflect in their guides for 4 minutes.)
