| TEKS | 7 | The student creates an effective learning environment. The student is expected to: describe and implement a safe and an effective learning environment that incorporates the principles of universal design; demonstrate teacher and trainer characteristics that promote an effective learning environment identify classroom management techniques that promote an effective learning environment | The student creates an effective learning environment.

| Rationale/ Summary | Investment in classroom systems is worthwhile so students know how to set themselves up for academic success with minimal teacher intervention. Increased student autonomy leads to increased joy and pride. Your goal should be to create an environment in which students are empowered to execute systems with a high degree of independence, thereby allowing you to focus your energy on facilitating learning. In this lesson, students will learn the importance of students owning classroom systems by limiting teacher talk to planned System Cues.   This is the second of three lessons about transferring ownership. In this lesson, students will choose one of the systems that they planned earlier in the Systems and Routines lessons and plan how they will shift their directions from Explicit Visible Directions to simple System Cues. | Investment in classroom systems is worthwhile so students know how to set themselves up for academic success with minimal teacher intervention.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Based on the feedback your received from your peers, what revisions and refinements do you need to make to your System Cue and mini-roll-out speech? What should you and your classmates consider moving forward to improve upon System Cues and roll-out? See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Based on the feedback your received from your peers, what revisions and refinements do you need to make to your System Cue and mini-roll-out speech?

|  | Prior to beginning the lesson, ensure you can access the video: Remove Scaffolding: Darryl Williams |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Why are System Cues important in the classroom? What are three aspects of a good System Cue? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Video: Remove Scaffolding T: Today we’re going to talk about how to set up students for success with minimal teacher intervention. This means that we’re creating System Cues that allow students to meet and expectation without lecturing or using class time to give a lot of instruction.  T: We’re going to watch a video called Remove Scaffolding. In your Student Guide there is a section for you to take notes as you watch the video.  T: (Show Remove Scaffolding—Darryl Williams.) S: (Take notes in Student Guide.) T: What are some things you noticed about Mr. Williams’ delivery transition from explicit instructions to using a System Cue?  S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide Remove Scaffolding: Darryl Williams |
| 10 mins | Designing Your Own System Cue T: You’re going to get some practice in designing your own system cue. In your Student Guide, locate the routine you designed in Lesson 1.08.  S: (Locate Lesson 1.08 and find their routine.)  T: Today you’re going to plan how to roll out that routine and take your instructions from explicit to a System Cue. Everyone please take 10 minutes to review your routine and write out your plan in the graphic organizer in your Student Guide.  S: (Fill out graphic organizer and draft mini-roll-out.) | Student Guide |
| 15 | Presentation & Peer Feedback T: Now that you have your plan, you are going to present just as you saw Mr. Williams model in the video. First, you will present your mini-roll-out speech. Next, you will present explicit, visible directions. Then you will present your directions with fewer words. Finally, you will present your System Cue.  T: Once one person in your group has presented, the other group members will give warm and cool feedback on the System Cue and the mini-roll-out. You can base your feedback on the criteria in the rubric in your Student Guide. T: Are there any questions about what you will be doing?  S: (Ask questions.)  T: (Answer questions.)  T: You will be working in groups of 3-4. You will have fifteen minutes to practice delivering your System Cues and mini-roll-outs. During that time, you should also provide feedback.  T: Please move into your groups and begin. S: (Move into groups and begin practicing.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: How did it feel to practice your System Cue?  S: Answers will vary.  T: As a student, how can proper use of a System Cue be helpful?  S: Because expectations are clear, consistent, and not confusing. | Student Guide |
