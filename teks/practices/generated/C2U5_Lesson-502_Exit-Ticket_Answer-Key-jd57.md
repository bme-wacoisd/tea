### Lesson 5.02: Characteristics of Effective Assessments

Name:
Date:
Evaluate your copy of the formative assessment (provided by your teacher) in relationship to the success criteria. Complete the graphic organizer to show your thinking.
Ms. D. is teaching her 4th grade class about money. Specifically, the goal of this lesson is to teach students to express money amounts given in various forms as decimal numbers. Review the formative assessment linked below to determine whether it meets the characteristics of effective assessment. If the criteria are not met, provide a suggestion for improvement.


| Success Criteria | Criteria Met? Y or N | Reasoning for why  criteria was met or not met? | Suggestion for Improvement (If criteria was not met) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assessment is aligned with learning target(s) and measures appropriate levels of rigor based on learning target (aligned to and requires attention to the most important content) | Y | The questions ask students to work with money in decimal form. |  |
| Assessment is fair and transparent (matches expectations of learning focus, not a “gotcha”) | N | The second question asks for fraction form. This was not a part of the lesson goal. The final question asks students to add money in decimal form. If they haven’t learned addition of decimals yet, this is a gotcha. | Remove fraction form from question 2. Remove question 3. |
| Assessment is practical (time, resources, student numbers) | N | There are too many questions for the assessment to be completed or analyzed quickly | Cut down the number of questions. Maybe only ask one question per coin type in the first section. |
| Assessment is cognitively engaging (why and how) | N | The problems do not get to the why or how of the learning. | Maybe add a question that engages students in why understanding money as decimals is important. |
