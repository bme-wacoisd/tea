| Rationale/ Summary | Learners differ in the way they express what they have learned. There is not one means of expression and communication that will be optimal for all learners; therefore, teachers must provide multiple options to allow students to express and communicate their learning. It is important to provide alternative modalities for expression, both to the level the playing field among learners and to allow the learner to appropriately (or easily) express knowledge, ideas, and concepts in the learning environment. In this lesson, students will identify and describe the guidelines for providing options for expression and communication. Students will examine scenarios to determine effective use of expression and communication and revise a nonexample to include strategies for providing alternative means for students to express and communicate their knowledge and understanding. | Learners differ in the way they express what they have learned.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Return to the bellringer scenario. Ms. C. just finished a lesson on insects and assigns students a brochure to show what they learned. The brochure must include information and pictures. One student in the class struggles with writing and although she learned a great deal about insects and can elaborately explain her learning, her teacher thinks she has a lack of knowledge and didn’t master the task because she struggled to create her brochure.  Based on what you learned in this lesson, what are some additional ways the teacher might find out what this student knows about insects?

| 3 mins | Bellringer: Ms. C. just finished a lesson on insects and assigns students to create a brochure to show what they learned. The brochure must include information and pictures. One student in the class struggles with writing and although she learned a great deal about insects and can elaborately explain her learning, her teacher thinks she has a lack of knowledge and didn’t master the task because she struggled to create her brochure. What are some other ways the teacher might find out what this student knows about insects? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | T: What are some other ways the teacher might find out what this student knows about insects?  S: Student response will vary but should reflect an understanding that the student should have alternative ways to share their learning. T: In our previous lesson, we learned that students vary in the ways they interact with the materials and tools given to them in a lesson. How does this same idea apply to the scenario?  S: Students not only have different preferences or abilities around how they engage with material, but also how to share their thinking and understanding. |  |
| 10 mins | Intro to Expression & Communication  T: Consider this scenario. You are a student in a 2nd grade class. Your class has engaged in various learning experiences to explore the properties of matter. Now, you must demonstrate your understanding of the following standard:   2.5A classify matter by physical properties, including relative temperature, texture, flexibility, and whether material is a solid or liquid.  T: Let’s brainstorm some options for sharing our understanding of this standard. What are some ways you might want to demonstrate your understanding of the properties of matter?   S: Students share ideas.  T: In your student guide, explain one way you would prefer to demonstrate your own understanding of this standard and why. You may use the list we brainstormed together to help you.   S: (Students write response in student guide.)  T: What are some of the ways you would want to share your understanding of this standard?  S: Student responses will vary.  T: What did you notice about the ways you suggested?  S: The ways we wanted to share our understanding were different. We didn’t all say the same thing.  T: Right – and what does that tell us about learners?  S: There isn’t just one way that all students like to share what they know. T: Yes - learners differ in the ways they approach learning tasks and in the way they express what they have learned. There is not one means of action and expression that will be optimal for all learners; therefore, teachers must provide multiple options to allow students to express and communicate their learning.   T: Today, we are going to learn about the next guideline for multiple means of action and expression – expression and communication.   T: One way to provide multiple means of action and expression is through providing options for expression and communication. For this guideline, teachers must provide flexibility in how students share knowledge, ideas, or concepts in the learning environment.    T: Let’s look at what this might look like in a classroom. (Share via PPT and walk students through each guideline.)  S: (Take notes in student guide.)  Adapted from CAST (2018). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.2. Retrieved from http://udlguidelines.cast.org T: Why is it important to allow students to communicate using multiple forms of media?  S: Students vary in what interests and motivates them to learn and in their comfort level with various forms of media. Some students may feel very comfortable speaking in front of the class, whereas others might prefer to explain their thinking or understanding through text. A teacher also must consider student disabilities that might hinder their ability to complete the task in a particular way.   T: Yes – if the goal is for students to demonstrate their understanding of the content, it shouldn’t matter how students choose to express that learning. Students should have the option to demonstrate their understanding through multiple means.   T: Unless a lesson is focused on learning how to use a specific tool, teachers should allow students to use alternative tools that aid their ability to share their thoughts and ideas. By allowing students to use different tools to support them in expressing their understanding, all students can take part in the learning and can articulate what they know without being hindered by skills such as their spelling and grammar capabilities.    T: Why is it important for a teacher to provide differentiated levels of support and scaffolds?  S: All students do not have the same level of understanding. Different students need different things.  T: Yes – consider a child learning to ride a bike. One child may need training wheels, one may only need an adult to help guide them as they get started, and another may be able to ride the bike without any support. Through multiple opportunities to practice, the children with scaffolds will eventually grow in their skills and independence to ride a bike by themselves to the point that they no longer need those supports. Until then, they need the extra support to make riding the bike possible.  T: It is important that a teacher considers the individual needs of students to provide the right level of support. Some students will need highly scaffolded opportunities with a high level of support, whereas others will not. | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | Practice 1 –Scenario Analysis T: Read the following example scenarios:  Example 1: Mrs. D spent the week teaching her students about frogs and the life cycle of a frog. To demonstrate their understanding, she gives students a worksheet where they must label the steps of the life cycle and write at least 3 sentences about a frog. She then provides students with materials to make a model of the life cycle of a frog.  Example 2: Mr. H also spent the week teaching his students about frogs and the life cycle of a frog. To demonstrate their understanding, Mr. H gives his students a choice board where they must choose how they want to demonstrate their learning about frogs and their life cycle. Some of the choices include making a video, creating a visual representation, writing a paragraph, podcast series, etc. Mr. H provides students with a rubric that indicates the key components of a frog life cycle that students must demonstrate in their products.  T: In your student guide, make a claim for which example best applies the strategies for expression and communication and explain why.    T: (Give students 3 minutes to respond.)    T: Which example best applies the strategies for expression and communication?  S: Example 2 was the best example because Mr. H gave his students a choice board that allowed them to choose the way they showed what they learned. For example, students could write a paragraph or create a video which provided opportunities for students to communicate using multiple forms of media. Mr. H also gave students a rubric so they would know the expectations for the assignment, which supported their independent expression of learning. | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Practice 2 – Demonstrate Your Understanding  T: Now, you are going to reflect on what you have learned so far in the first two lessons for multiple means of action & expression – physical action and expression & communication.   T: Turn to your student guide and write down key ideas and information you have learned so far about physical action and expression & communication.  T: (Give students about 5 minutes)  S: (Record notes in student guide)  T: With a partner, you are going to prepare a short 2-minute presentation to share what you have learned about physical action and expression and communication. You may choose the form of media you want to use to communicate your ideas, such as a short oral presentation, drawing, music, comic, or video.   T: Before you begin preparing your presentation, you and your partner will have 2 minutes to share the key ideas you wrote down in your student guide.  T: Find a partner and discuss key ideas.  S: (Pair up and discuss key ideas.)  T: (After 2 minutes). Now you are going to begin preparing your presentations. You will have about 10 minutes to prepare. As you work, I will walk around to assist you with technology and provide feedback.  S: (Prepare presentation for group.)  T: (Allow about 10 minutes for students to prepare their presentations.)   T: You are now going to partner with another group to share your presentation.   S: (Students partner with another group and share what they have learned about physical action and expression & communication.) | Student Guide Access to digital tools for PPT presentations, video recording, etc. |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: What are some key ideas you have learned about physical action and expression & communication so far?  S: Students share key ideas  T: How did this lesson include the guidelines for expression and communication?  S: You provided opportunities for us to share our understanding using multiple forms of media. You allowed us to use different tools to create our short presentations. You provided us guidance and feedback as we prepared our presentations.   T: Why is it important to offer alternative means for students to express their ideas and communicate their understanding?  S: Learners differ in the way they want to express what they have learned. There is not one means of action and expression that will be optimal for all learners because different things interest and motivate different people and some have disabilities that hinder their ability to perform certain tasks. |  |
