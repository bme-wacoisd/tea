### Lesson 3.03: Building Trust and Rapport with Students | Trust-Generating Practices

Name:
Date:

Bellringer: Mr. Q is getting ready to have a brief check-in with a student. How can he build rapport with the student and show the student that he is authentically listening?
Mr. Q can authentically listen to the student by giving the student his full attention, demonstrating empathy, suspending judgment, and letting the student express themselves in their own way. When Mr. Merit authentically listens to the student, he is building rapport by connecting with the students’ words and feelings and allowing the student to bring his/her authentic self to the conversation. Building rapport this way improves trust, which then can lead to positive outcomes for student learning.

#### Trust-Generating Practices

What is a trust generator? A trust generator is an activity that a teacher uses to build trust and strengthen rapport with students.
Define each trust generator and give an example of what that practice might look like in action.

#### Practice: Trust Generator Scenarios


Ms. W has a number of student athletes in her class. She always asks the students about the outcome of the games but has never attended a sporting event.
Non-Example - Familiarity and Similarity of Interests; Ms. W could improve this by attending a game and then mentioning a specific play or goal that she saw.

Mr. C’s science class is learning about X. Halfway through his explanation, a number of students get confused and begin asking questions. Mr. C responds by repeating what he said at the beginning of his explanation. As he repeats, he gets louder and louder and increasingly frustrated with students he thinks are not listening.
Non-Example: Competence or Selective Vulnerability; Mr. C can make students feel more comfortable by saying something like “Wow. I didn’t explain that very well. Let me try again.”

#### Ms. M has the star of the women’s basketball team in her class. She was also on school’s basketball team when she was younger and so she and her student often discuss basketball. When the student asks Ms. M at the beginning of class to attend a big game, Ms. M readily agrees and then continues a conversation with the player even after the bell rings. They talk about basketball for the first five minutes of class while other students chat with their peers. They are used to Ms. M getting sidetracked with basketball conversations.


Non-Example - Familiarity and Similarity of Interest; Ms. M should thank the student for inviting her to the game and tell her that she is looking forward to catching up with her during lunch to chat about basketball. She should then talk to the student during lunch and follow through with attending the game.

Adam is a student in Mr. V’s 7th grade ELA classroom. Adam is not doing well in his math class and comes to ELA one day complaining about math. Mr. V has a private conversation with Adam. He asks Adam about the content they are covering in math and shares that he, too, struggled with that content when he was younger. Mr. V tells Adam that some people just aren’t good at math and that there are many jobs that don’t even require it.
Non-Example - Selective Vulnerability and Competence; Mr. V should assure Adam that  he is capable and that they can work together to help him better understand.

Jason comes to class without having completed his homework. His teacher, Mr. A, learned earlier that Jason’s mother had spent the night in the emergency room. Mr. A asks Jason, in front of the class, if he was missing his homework because of his mother being in the hospital. Jason is clearly embarrassed, does not answer the question, and puts his head down on the desk.
Non-Example – Concern; Mr. A should not address Jason in front of the whole class but should have a 1:1 conversation with him. Additionally, Mr. A should not call out the student for not having their homework in front of the whole class, as that can be embarrassing for the child.


| Trust Generator | Definition | Example | Non-Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selective Vulnerability | Connecting with another person who also shares their own vulnerable moments | Sharing with a student a challenge you had as a young person/learner. Sharing new skills, you are learning and how they challenge you | Sharing a challenging relationship, you have with another teacher in the building. Sharing overly personal information that might raise questions about your reliability or distract from learning. |
| Familiarity | Relaxed friendliness between people who are recognizable based on seeing one another on a regular basis | Running into a student and their family at the grocery store Attending community events that you know the student may have attended. Crossing paths with a student at recess or lunch | Trying to be “friends” with a student Allowing students to call teachers by their first name. Spending too much time on non-academics during academic time |
| Similarity of Interests | A common affinity that allows a point of connection beyond any obvious racial, class, or linguistic differences | Sharing your hobbies or interests that are like a student’s interests. Sharing social causes, you are passionate about that may resonate with students | Sharing interests that are inappropriate for the student’s age (like sharing an R-rated movie or PG-13 for younger students) |
| Concern | A matter of interest important to someone | Remembering details about a student’s life (e.g., sick grandmother, has an older sibling in the military) Asking follow-up questions about recent events that impact students | Allowing a student to skip class because they are having a hard day. Keeping a student’s secret when they need additional support |
| Competence | The skill, knowledge, and will help and support another person | Demonstrating the ability to teach effectively or making content less confusing. Making learning more exciting so students can be more successful | Being unprepared for class (disorganized, missing materials) Not knowing a variety of ways to teach content when students don’t get it the first time |
