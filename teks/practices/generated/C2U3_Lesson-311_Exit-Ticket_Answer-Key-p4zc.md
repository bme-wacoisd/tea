Name:
Date:
Circle true or false for each of the following statements. If you circle false, explain your reasoning underneath the statement.
Teachers need to finish their learner profiles at the beginning of the school year.
TRUE			FALSE
It’s a good idea for teachers to learn about students at the beginning of the year, but they can add to learner profiles anytime they find out something new about a student.
A learner profile is a place for teachers to collect all the information they gather about their students.
TRUE			FALSE
Data from student families is an important piece of a learner profile.
TRUE			FALSE
Because it often includes student test scores, quantitative data is the most important for teachers to collect.
TRUE			FALSE
If a teacher only looks at quantitative data, they might miss something important about a student. Both qualitative and quantitative sources are valuable.
Respond to each of the following statements.
List a question answered by quantitative and qualitative data. For each type, give an example of what a teacher might gather.
Quantitative data answers “how many.” Qualitative data answers “why.” An example of qualitative data is if a student likes groupwork or to do work on their own. An example of quantitative data is a student’s grades from last year.
Why should a teacher collect data about students?
It helps them get to know their students better. They can also make sure that their teaching helps each student learn.
Identify a strategy that a teacher can use to collect qualitative and quantitative data. How can this strategy collect both types of data?
Looking at a student’s academic record can give teachers both types of data. Grades and test scores are quantitative data, and comments from the student’s teachers are qualitative data.
