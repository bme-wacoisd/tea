Concept Map

How might a teacher challenge their students?





Challenge Scenario
Read the scenario below, then answer the questions that follow.

Ms. Wood is reviewing a math problem with her class. A student, Kayla, answers.

Ms. Wood: What is the area of a rectangle with a long side measuring 12 inches and a short side measuring 10 inches?

Kayla: 120.

Ms. Wood: Yes, Kayla. Excellent. But 120 what? How would a mathematician say it?

Kayla: 120 inches squared.

Ms. Wood: Great job! Now you sound like a mathematician.

- How does Ms. Wood encourage Kayla to revise her initial solution, and what message do those words send?







- What impact might do you think this interaction could have for Kayla?




Notes on Challenge!
List the elements of an effective Challenge







Four Ways to Bring Challenge to Students
List the four ways to bring Challenge to students and provide a description.



Practice 1: Study the example and upgrade the nonexample
Read the different examples of Challenge provided by the teacher and record the examples in the chart above. Discuss as a class how this list aligns with the success criteria.

Upgrade the nonexample
Look at statements below that do not meet the success criteria. Work with a partner to identify how the statements do not meet the success criteria and adjust the statements to improve them.


Practice 2: Creating Effective Challenge Statements
Plan a Challenge statement using the following scenarios. As you plan, ensure your statement:
- Inspires students
- Maintains Economy of Language
- Maintains Emotional Constancy


Scenario #1: Mr. Richardson’s sixth graders are doing a project on a scientist of their choice, which they will present to the class. He notices that Daria’s project includes basic information but lack details that would meet all of the assignment criteria and also make her project and presentation engaging. He wants to encourage and motivate his Daria.

Scenario #2: It is almost the end of the class period, and Mr. Richardson’s students still have many of their project materials out. The classroom needs to be cleaned up quickly as he prepares for his next class. How can Mr. Richardson motivate his students to best use their remaining time?




Practice 3: Delivering Your Challenge Statements
With a partner, take turns delivering your Challenge statements for the two scenarios above. As your partner delivers their Challenge statement, use the feedback rubric below to provide specific feedback to your partner on their alignment to the success criteria.
