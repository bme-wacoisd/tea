| Rationale/ Summary | Formal summative pencil and paper assessments are vital to assess independent mastery of knowledge and skill. Applying a core set of design strategies in the development, administration, and scoring of pencil and paper assessments can support gathering of accurate data and creating a motivating and supportive disposition toward higher-stakes tests. | Formal summative pencil and paper assessments are vital to assess independent mastery of knowledge and skill.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  In most of your classes, you take pencil and paper assessments regularly. Perhaps you take Friday quizzes and/or have big tests at the end of units that take all or most of a class period. Take the pre-assessment on your student guide about pencil and paper assessment practices and be ready to talk about your thinking on each of these questions. | Student Guide PPT |
| 4 mins | Bellringer Debrief T: Let’s start class with a quick review of the pre-assessment about pencil and paper assessments from the bell ringer.  T: (Use a random selection technique – like popsicle sticks with students’ names – to call on students to provide their answer and rationale for each of the bell ringer questions.)  T: (As you hear from students, affirm correct responses and correct misunderstandings.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 13 mins | Introduction to Pencil and Paper Assessments – Best Practices Graphic Organizer  T: Today we are going to discuss pencil and paper assessments.  These are summative assessments that typically happen at the end of weeks, units, and/or quarters. You are all familiar with them. T: We are going to talk about best practices for developing, administering, and scoring pencil and paper tests.   T: To do so, we will use a graphic organizer to categorize and explore the best practices and then will practice identifying examples and non-examples.  T: Please follow along in your graphic organizer taking notes as I review these best practices.   T: (Teacher fills out graphic organizer displayed on the overhead while students follow along).  S: (Complete graphic organizer as teacher explains best practices.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | Quick Turn and Talk – Test Anxiety  T: Many of you have probably heard of the idea of test anxiety, which is student stress caused by the higher stakes of summative tests that can lead to unpleasant feelings and performance that is not representative of a student’s true understanding.  T: We have just gone over some best practices for formal pencil and paper tests. Which of these practices do you think would help manage test anxiety and why?  Turn and talk with your neighbor.  S: (Students turn and talk).  T: (Ask students to share some of their thinking.)  S: (Answers will vary and will likely include:  No Surprises - because you will get tested on what you were taught. Format with space and clarity - because you’ll have plenty of room to show your work. Reduce distractions - so you can focus on the test and noises or distractions. Clear directions - so you know exactly what to do. Focus on the why - so that the test isn’t about how smart or good you are but simply about your learning progress.)  T: Some level of stress when it comes to higher-stakes tests is inevitable, but as a teacher, taking steps to reduce test anxiety is both helpful to students and can allow them to do their best and demonstrate what they know. | Student Guide PPT |
| 13 min | Practice – Pencil and Paper Best Practice Examples and Non-examples.   T: Now I am going to ask you to look at some scenarios and identify which ones are best practice and which ones are not.  T: Please use the table of scenarios and identify which one is a best practice and why.  I’ll give you about 5 minutes to work and then we will have whole group debrief of the examples.  S: (Students read and respond to the scenarios in the student guide.)  T: (After about 7 minutes, lead a whole group discussion based on the answers in the Student Guide – Answer Key, asking students to correct their answers in the student guide as necessary.)  S: (Students respond and correct answers in student guide.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete exit ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
