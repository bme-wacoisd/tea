| 5 mins | Bellringer: Five Minute Free Write: What about you makes you unique? What skills, interests, talents, are you most proud of? | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | Understanding Personal Statements: T: Did you find this bellringer to be challenging? S: (Respond yes or no.) T: Why do you think that it’s challenging to write out or discuss our unique attributes? S: (Answers will vary.) T: Today we’re going to discuss personal statements. You may be asked to write a personal statement for a scholarship, award, college admission, or even for a job. Part of that process is being able to identify the things about you that help you to stand out, as well how to communicate those things professionally to make a good first impression. T: . Personal statements focus on one to two questions that help describe who you are or why you would be a good fit for a certain opportunity. That means that we need to approach them differently than we would, for example, an “about me” section on a social media app.  T: Has anyone ever had to write a letter or an essay to be accepted into a program?  S: (Share out if applicable.) T: (Use student experience to guide discussion, if applicable.) T: Today we’re going to look at three examples of common personal statements you may be asked to write as you prepare for life beyond high school: admission essays, cover letters, and purpose statements. T: Before we discuss these in depth, let’s review the definitions of each of these. Can I have a volunteer read the definition of personal statement?  S: (Reads definitions). T: Today we’re going practice writing our own personal statements. There are a few key things to consider when writing a personal statement. T: First, you will want to ensure you have done some research into the positions, programs, and place to which you’re applying. When looking into the program or opportunity, consider the following questions: What do they value? What are they looking for? Does it align with my values and what I want to do?   T: Secondly, you will want to examine how your skills and experience fit the position or program. List the skills and experiences that match with the values and needs of the program or position.  T: Lastly, review your list of skills and determine the top three that you feel align with the values and needs of the program or position, and that also align with your ultimate outcome. These three skills will inform the body of your personal statement. | Student Guide PPT |
| 20 mins | Personal Statements Activity: T: Today you’re going to do some research into a program of study (at a college/university), job, scholarship, or other opportunity to which you’re interested in applying. You do not have to submit this application—but you are going to write a personal statement as though you were going to. T: For this activity you will first need to identify the program and what their personal statement requirements are. Are they asking for an answer to a specific prompt? Is the prompt open ended? Is there a word count/page limit? T: Next, you will begin to draft your personal statement. Everyone’s will look slightly different because most of us will likely be looking into different opportunities. While there is a template in your Student Guide that you may use, you can also elect to write your own template for your draft. T: While you’re working on your personal statements, I will walk around to help each of you. | Student Guide Internet enabled device |
| 7 mins | Partner Reflection:  T: Now that you have had a chance to draft your statements, you will have an opportunity to get feedback from a partner.  T: Exchange your personal statement with a partner if you are comfortable doing so. As you are reading your classmate’s statement, provide them with written feedback (in comments if on a device, in the margins if on paper) indicating areas of strength and feedback for growth. S: (Annotate classmates work samples) | Student Guide Personal Statement Examples |
| 3 mins | Debrief:   T: What was some positive feedback you received from your partner? S: (Answers will vary.) T: What did you find challenging about this activity? S: (Answers will vary.) T: Hopefully this practice will help you see the steps necessary to write a convincing and accurate personal statement in the future! |  |
