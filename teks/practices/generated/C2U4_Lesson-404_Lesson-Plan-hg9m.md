| Rationale/ Summary | Aligning lesson plans and student activities to the most important content is a vital aspect of instructional design. In this lesson, students will learn more about how teachers focus students’ attention to the most important content. Students will examine and evaluate a sample lesson to identify the most important content and consider alignment of activities within the lesson to the most important content. | Aligning lesson plans and student activities to the most important content is a vital aspect of instructional design.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Read the scenario and respond to the prompt in your student guide. | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | T: Let’s take a poll. How many of you chose Activity 1?  S: (Students raise their hands to indicate their choice.)  T: How many chose Activity 2?   S: (Students raise their hands to indicate their choice.)  T: If you chose Activity 2, what was your reasoning? (Call on volunteers to explain.)  S: (Explain their thinking.)  T: Activity 2 is the correct choice. While Activity 1 addresses a student’s ability to differentiate between informative and persuasive writing, it does not get to the level of author’s choice and how an author makes decisions that reveal the purpose of a text. | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | Think-Pair-Share  T: Yesterday we talked about attending to the most important content. Take a minute to make some notes about what you remember from yesterday’s lesson about attending to the most important content.   S: (Make notes about yesterday’s lesson in their student guide.)  T: Now, turn and talk with a partner about what you learned yesterday. If you are in an even row, turn to your right. If you are in an odd row, turn to your left.  S: (Turn and talk with their partners.)  T: Why is where you focus student attention important?  S: You can’t learn unless you are paying attention and your brain is activated. There is more in your environment that you can pay attention to at one time, so it isn’t always easy to know what to focus on. | Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Practice 1: Identifying the Most Important Content  T: Today, we are going to practice identifying the most important content. Then we are going to analyze a lesson plan to determine whether it aligns to the most important content and make revisions where needed. Let’s start by identifying the most important content.  T: To identify the most important content, teachers should ask themselves two questions. First, what do my students need to know, understand, and be able to do by the end of this lesson. Second, where do I want to focus my students’ attention. Find the Practice 1 scenarios in your student guide. Let’s do the first one together.   S: (Find Practice 1 in their student guides.)  T: (Call on a student to read the first scenario aloud.)  S: (One student reads the scenario aloud while others follow along in their student guides.)  T: (Engage in a Think Aloud to talk through the first scenario using the Student Guide Answer Key to guide your thinking.)  S: (Follow along and complete the first scenario row in their student guide.)  T: Now it’s your turn. Work with a partner to complete the next two scenarios.  S: (Find a partner and complete the next two scenarios.)  T: Now that you and your partner have completed the scenarios, join another group to compare answers.  S: (Combine groups and discuss answers.)  T: Let’s review as a whole class. Who would like to share their thinking about the science scenario?   S: (Volunteer to share.)  T: (Provide follow up questions and feedback, as necessary.)  T: Who can share their answers to the math scenario?   S: (Volunteer to share.)  T: (Provide follow up questions and feedback, as necessary.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 14 mins | Practice 2: Lesson Analysis and Revision  T: Now it’s time to put everything together into a lesson analysis. Yesterday, you practiced evaluating lessons and today you have practiced identifying the most important content. With a partner, you are now going to examine a complete lesson plan to determine where the plan is focused on the most important content and where it is not. You will also offer suggestions for how to improve activities that are not focused on the most important content.  S: (Work with a partner to examine, analyze, and offer suggestions to improve the lesson plan provided.) | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Debrief:   T: Where did you find that the lesson was not in alignment with the most important content?   S: When the teacher started the lesson, she was focused on the story of Cinderella instead of story elements. Then during the guided practice, she focused her questions on making predictions instead of focusing on story elements. At the end of the lesson, students would have been more focused on imagining and writing their stories than on the elements.   T: How would these activities in the lesson have impacted student learning?   S: Their attention would have been on the wrong information, and they would have a hard time learning the material. | Student Guide |
