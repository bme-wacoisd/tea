## Slide 6

### Intro to Classroom Reward Systems


| Component | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Students need to know the purpose of the behavior management system and the reasons for various aspects of the system. Students should understand that a positive system creates an organized, consistent, culturally-responsive, and integrated classroom environment that supports effective instruction and promotes student learning; Engages and communicates with students (and families) in an ongoing manner. Without a purpose, students may not fully engage in the system, which can result in a disorderly classroom, disruptive behaviors, loss of instructional time, decreased student engagement, etc. |
| Commitment | Teachers and Students must commit to supporting and implementing the system consistently and with fidelity.  Students need to understand that the school community – students, parents, teachers, administrators, etc. – will work together to create and maintain a safe and supportive environment to promote teaching and learning. If a teacher is not consistent, students likely will not be either. |

## Slide 7

### Intro to Classroom Reward Systems


| Component | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Defines behavioral expectations, procedures, and consequences | Students need to be explicitly taught the classroom expectations and procedures and the consequences of not following through with those expectations and procedures. |
| Fair | Teachers must ensure fairness in the system. A system will backfire and is potentially harmful if students view it as unfair. |
| Individual or Group Rewards | The teacher must decide is the system will focus only on students earning individual rewards for their own good behavior, or target group rewards where the whole class is rewarded for good behavior. There may also be a combination of the two. |

## Slide 8

### Intro to Classroom Reward Systems


| Component | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Type of rewards | Teachers must decide the type of rewards they will over, such as stickers, trip to the treasure chest, tokens, points, etc. The teacher must also decide if those rewards can be added up and later traded for a larger reward, such as a small prize or activity. |
| Acknowledge and reward positive behaviors | The teacher must immediately reward students for their positive behavior to reinforce the desired behaviors. The desired behavior will occur more frequently if it is immediately followed by positive reinforcement. |
| Keeps parents informed | Parents must be made aware of the expected behaviors, the classroom reward system, and routinely informed about student behaviors. |
