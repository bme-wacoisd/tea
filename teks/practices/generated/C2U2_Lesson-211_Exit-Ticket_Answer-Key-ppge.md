### Lesson 2.11: Rolling Out Classroom Rules

Name:
Date:
Consider the following rollout speech:
Class, we are going to talk about one of our most important classroom rules today: Be ready and prepared when the bell rings. Do you realize how much learning time can be lost at the beginning of class if you are not ready to go when the bell rings? Let’s do a little math. There are 180 days in a school year. Let’s say that it takes you three minutes a day to get yourselves together, pull out your pencils and notebooks, stop talking with your friends. Three minutes a day may not seem like a lot but over time that’s 9 hours of learning. More than a full day lost. So, get excited! I want everybody to be prepared when the bell rings. Let’s see. Who looks prepared? Mayra looks prepared. Samuel looks prepared. Maria looks prepared. Darius looks prepared. Asa looks prepared.

Which of the following criteria does this rollout speech meet? Check any/all that apply and explain your decisions.
- Clear, concise, and enthusiastic
- It is enthusiastic but not clear or concise
- Starts with the why
- It doesn’t start with the why
- Models and describes
- The teacher does not provide a model of what “ready and prepared” looks like
- Pre-empt pitfalls
- The teacher does not address common pitfalls
- Scan and give feedback
- The teacher provides positive feedback for students engaged in appropriate behaviors.

Rewrite the speech so it aligns with all success criteria.
Class, we are going to talk about one of our most important classroom rules today: Be ready and prepared when the bell rings.  This rule ensures that everyone has the most time for the exciting learning we do each day.  Can you all show me what it looks like to be ready and prepared?  I see that Samuel and Mayra have ended their conversation and have their pencils out. Maria is sitting up straight with her feet facing forward, pencil in hand. This is what it looks like to be ready and prepared. Now, let’s practice. Head out to the hall and then come back in. Notice the timer on the screen. When the timer is out of time, you all should be ready and prepared.
