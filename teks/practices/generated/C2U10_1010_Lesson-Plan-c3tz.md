## Unit 10: Putting It Together – The Teaching Profession, Professionalism, and the Final Portfolio

### Lesson 10.10: Professionalism, Presentation, and Conduct





Practice: Evaluating Teacher Professionalism
Script for Student Scenarios
Scenario 1
Teacher: Can you believe what Ms. W. is wearing today? She’s dressed just like a student.
Student (Acting as Another Teacher): Maybe we should change topics? Students are starting to arrive.
Teacher: Don’t worry about it. They come in and get started on their bellringer, so they’re not even paying attention.
Student (Acting as Another Teacher): Well, okay. I completely agree. Her clothes are way too tight. Someone should say something to her.
Teacher: Well, it’s not going to be me. I’m not getting into a fight with her about it.
Scenario 2
Teacher (Acting as Parent): Ms. G., I’m here to talk with you about James’ grade in your class. He studies so hard; he can’t be failing.
Student (Acting as Teacher): Hello, Ms. H. It’s great to see you today. I’m glad that you want to talk more about James’ grades. James does try to complete his assignments, but he seems to stop trying as soon as something is difficult.
Teacher (Acting as Parent): Well, that just means you’re a bad teacher. It wouldn’t be hard for him if you were teaching the right way.
Student (Acting as Teacher): Ms. H., I know we both care about James and want him to do well. Let’s set up a time to meet the assistant principal for James’ grade level so that we can discuss this more. We can work together to come up with some strategies for supporting him. Before the meeting, let’s both think about what might work, and we can discuss it then. I want to work together with you to help James.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Read the following quote from American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson and explain what it means about the teaching profession.  "The great teacher is not the (person) who supplies the most facts, but the one in whose presence we become different people." | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Teacher Professionalism in Action T: Next to their family, students spend the most time with their teachers. They see them every day for a semester or a school year. Every interaction between a student and a teacher adds up to a larger idea. The teacher is modeling how to act professionally and responsibly for students.   T: Professionalism is the qualities, behaviors, and attitudes a person exhibits on the job. Add this definition to your Student Guide.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Can I have a volunteer, in their own words, explain why it is important for teachers to be professional?  S: Responses may vary but may include: Because teachers show students how they should behave. Students spend so much time with their teachers that they see them as role models. Students learn about how they should act in their jobs from teachers.  T: Use what your classmates just said to answer the question in your Student Guide.  S: (Answer question in Student Guide.)  T: We will now discuss what it means for a teacher to be professional. Professionalism may not mean the same thing to every person, so it is important for us to have a shared concept of professionalism for educators.  T: Teachers who are professionals: Stay organized and starting on time. Are clear about expectations. Model how to conduct oneself in a classroom. Is task oriented. Are respectful. Set boundaries and rules and reinforce those rules. Are kind, welcoming and enthusiastic? Address conflict with grace and care Dress and present in a professional manner Please add these characteristics to your Student Guide.  S: (Add characteristics to Student Guide.)  T: Does anyone have questions about these characteristics?  S: (Ask questions.)  T: (Answer questions, as needed.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 10 mins | Guided Practice: Identifying Professionalism  T: We can deepen our understanding of professionalism by seeing it in action. We will watch two short videos of teachers who are acting professionally in several ways. For each one, I will ask you to reflect on which of the characteristics we listed above you saw in the video.  T: Our first video shows a teacher named Mr. Frazer. You will see him working with his class and, specifically, a student who answers a question incorrectly.  T: (Play video.)  S: (Watch video.)  T: In your Student Guide, there is a checklist of the professional characteristics, along with space for you to add details on when you saw Mr. Frazier demonstrate each characteristic. We will complete this checklist together. Can I have a volunteer share one of the characteristics they noted and when they saw it?  S: Responses should include: Mr. Frazier is clear about expectations when he explains that he expects all the students to be looking at Rayna when they speak. Mr. Frazier models how to conduct oneself in a classroom when he looks at Rayna when they are speaking, which is what the students are supposed to do. Mr. Frazier is respectful when he asks Rayna to explain their answer instead of just telling them that the answer was wrong. Mr. Frazier sets boundaries and rules and reinforces them. He has established tracking as a classroom rule. Mr. Frazier is kind, welcoming and enthusiastic when he tells the students that they are brave for volunteering to answer the question. Mr. Frazier dresses and presents in a professional manner as he is wearing a dress shirt and a tie.  T: We will now watch a second video that shows Mr. Carter working with his elementary school students. After the video is over, I will give you three minutes to complete the checklist on your own. We will then review the answers as a class.  T: (Play video.)  S: (Watch video.)  T: I will set a timer for three minutes for you to complete the checklist on your own.  T: (Set three-minute timer.)  S: (Complete checklist in Student Guide.)  T: Let’s review the checklist. Can I have a volunteer share one of the characteristics they noted and when they saw it?  S: Responses should include: Mr. Carter models how to conduct oneself in a classroom when he praises the student, and he also acknowledges the student who was encouraging their classmate. Mr. Carter is respectful when the student was having some trouble answering, but Mr. Carter gave him some time to answer. Mr. Carter is kind, welcoming and enthusiastic because he has a lot of energy. Mr. Carter dresses and presents in a professional manner as he is wearing a dress shirt and a tie. | Student Guide Videos: Do It Again – Denarius Frazer Unbundle and Follow-On: Na’Jee Carter |
| 10 mins | Practice: Evaluating Teacher Professionalism T: We will now complete role-plays of some scenarios so that we can consider whether the teachers in them are acting professionally or not. Can I have a volunteer do the first role-play with me?  S: (Volunteers.)  T: (Gives the student the script for the scenarios.)  T: In this scenario, two teachers are talking before the school day begins. As they are talking, students begin to arrive for the morning. Both our volunteer and I will be acting as teachers.  T and Student Volunteer: (Read script.)  T: This completes the first scenario. Please take three minutes to respond to the questions in your Student Guide.  T: (Set three-minute timer.)  S: (Complete questions in Student Guide.)  T: Can I have a volunteer share how these teachers acted professionally?  S: Responses may vary but may include: The second teacher acted professionally when she said that they should stop talking about Ms. W. in front of students. The first teacher does have a routine for her students when they come into class.  T: How did they act unprofessionally?  S: Responses may vary but may include: It is not respectful for them to be talking about another teacher like this, especially in front of students. Students who overhear the conversation may not feel like the classroom is a kind and welcoming environment.  T: Now, let’s consider a second role-play. Can I have a volunteer do this role-play with me?  S: (Volunteers.)  T: (Gives the student the script for the scenarios.)  T: In this scenario, a parent comes into the classroom after-school to speak with a teacher. I will be acting as the parent, and our volunteer will be acting as the teacher.  T and Student Volunteer: (Read script.)  T: This completes the second scenario. Please take three minutes to respond to the questions in your Student Guide.  T: (Set three-minute timer.)  S: (Complete questions in Student Guide.)  T: Can I have a volunteer share how this teacher acted professionally?  S: Responses may vary but may include: The teacher was respectful to the parent.

| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Can I have a volunteer remind us of the definition for professionalism?  S: The qualities, behaviors, and attitudes a person exhibits on the job  T: We discussed several elements of professionalism today. Which one do you think will be most challenging for you?  S: Responses may vary but may include: Handling conflict with grace and care because I always want to take care of problems on my own. Setting boundaries and rules because I will want my students to be able to be relaxed rather than worried about following the rules all the time. | Student Guide |
