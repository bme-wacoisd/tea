| Rationale/ Summary | Aligned assessment is an essential component of instruction as it allows a teacher to intentionally build on and evaluate students understanding as a lesson increases in complexity. This lesson will review student understanding of assessment and will provide opportunities for students to identify the assessments in a lesson, evaluate alignment between assessment and lesson objective(s), and identify information provided through the assessment to the teacher. | Aligned assessment is an essential component of instruction as it allows a teacher to intentionally build on and evaluate students understanding as a lesson increases in complexity.

|  | Prior to this lesson, consider how you will provide students with the sample lesson plan: A Story of Units, Lesson 6 (Grade 4). This resource is available with the supplemental materials for this unit, and may be printed or distributed digitally. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  What are the characteristics of effective assessment?  Review the scenario, objective, and formative assessment provided. Evaluate and provide suggestions for improvement based on the characteristics of effective assessment. | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | T: In our last unit, we learned about assessment. Let’s see what you remember. I’ll start by calling on one student to share one characteristic of effective assessment. Then, that student will call on a peer to share the next characteristic. We’ll continue until all characteristics have been shared.   S: (Volunteers one characteristic and then calls on another student to share the next characteristic. Repeat until all characteristics have been shared.) Aligned to learning targets and appropriate level of rigor (focuses on the most important content), fair and transparent, practical, and cognitively engaging.  T: And based on those criteria, how did you assess the example provided in your bellringer?   S: (Share responses from their bellringer scenario analysis.)  T: Let’s see what else you remember. What is the purpose of assessments – especially formative assessments – for teachers and students?   S: They provide students multiple opportunities for practice, which helps them transfer information from short term memory to long term memory. For teachers, they provide information about student understanding to inform the teacher’s next steps.  T: Why is alignment important?   S: Because students should only be practicing steps and skills aligned to the objective and teachers should collect information that helps them to teach the standard.  T: Yes. Remember that assessments should be aligned to the content and to the level of thinking required in the objective. |  |
| 15 mins | Think Aloud and Practice 1: Lesson Analysis  T: We’re going to take another look at the counting coins lesson we analyzed earlier in the unit. As we review the lesson, we are going to look for all formative assessments the teacher uses. We will determine if and how each assessment is aligned with the objective and what information each assessment provides the teacher about student learning. I’ll do the first one for you and then I’ll ask you to do the rest with me. Follow along and take notes in the graphic organizer in your student guide.  S: (Find graphic organizer in the student guide.)  T: Before we review and analyze the assessments in this lesson, let’s first review the lesson objective and what students should know and be able to do by the end of the lesson. Who will read the lesson objective aloud for the class?  S: (Raise hands to volunteer response.)  T: (Call on student volunteer.) What is the lesson objective?   S: Recognize the value of coins and count up to find their total value. T: Thank you. If students have met the objective, what should they know and be able to do at the end of the lesson?   S: They should be able to recognize each type of coin and determine the value of each individual coin. They also should be able to use the value of individual coins to count up the total value of a number of coins in a group.   T: The first formative assessment related to the objective that I see is the decomposition tree. The teacher models one problem to show students how to do it and then students do one on their own. They pair up to provide peer feedback, and after peer feedback, students continue working to find new pairs.   S: (Take notes in the graphic organizer.)  T: This assessment is aligned to the lesson objective because to complete the decomposition tree, students must know the value of individual coins. Knowing the value of individual coins is one of the first steps in being able to count total value of a group of coins.  S: (Take notes in the graphic organizer.)  T: Through the assessment, the teacher can find out whether students are able to break total amounts into smaller parts of two different types of coins. The teacher can also tell whether students are able to recognize correct and incorrect pairs.  S: (Take notes in the graphic organizer.)   T: Now, it’s your turn. What is the next assessment you see?   S: (Volunteer responses and take notes in the student guide.) | A Story of Units – Lesson 6 Copies (digital or print) Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Practice 2: Non-example  T: Now, let’s look at a non-example – a lesson where the assessments don’t quite line up the way they should. Follow along in your student guide. Who will read the scenario out loud?  S: (Find scenario and graphic organizer in student guide. One student reads the scenario out loud.)  T: OK, so I see that the first assessment the teacher uses is a thumbs-up, down, and sideways. This is an informal and quick assessment to see if the students remember the lesson, she taught the previous day. The problem with this assessment is that it does not tell the teacher whether the students remember the skill taught the previous day. Even if they remember the lesson, they may or may not know how to count coin values to find the total. Instead, the teacher should engage students in a bellringer that provides them opportunities to practice the previous day’s skill, so she knows if they are ready to move forward or not.   S: (Take notes in student guide.)  T: Let’s do the next one together. What’s the next formative assessment?   S: (Volunteer a response.)  T: Now, turn to a partner. If you are in an odd row, turn to the row behind you. Work with your partner to analyze the remaining assessments.  S: (Work in pairs to complete the practice activity.)  T: Let’s review your answers. | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Debrief  T: Today we learned about the importance of aligning assessments to lesson objectives. What might happen if the formative assessments in a lesson are not aligned with the lesson objectives?   S: Students may not focus on the most important content, students will practice the wrong skills, students won’t be able to build on their prior knowledge to get to the rigor of thinking required by the objective, teachers won’t know if their students know what they need to know to move to the next part of the lesson.  T: And why is it important for a teacher to use a variety of assessments throughout a lesson?   S: Each assessment gives teachers new information about student understanding. As the teacher moves through instruction, it is important to be sure students are understanding all along the way.   T: What might happen if a teacher waits until the end of a lesson to give an assessment or if the assessments throughout the unit only assessed the same thing?   S: The teacher might miss information about student misunderstandings. The teacher might come to the end of the lesson and realize that students did not learn the material because they were confused early in the lesson. | Student Guide |
