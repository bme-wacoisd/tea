| 5 mins | Bellringer Mr. Merit is getting ready to have a brief check-in with a student. How can he build rapport with the student and show the student that he is authentically listening? | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Trust-Generating Practices T: In our last lesson, we discussed the importance of teachers building trust and rapport with students. What is rapport and how does rapport impact trust and student learning?  S: Rapport is a relationship characterized by mutual understanding or empathy that makes communication possible or easy. Rapport impacts trust because the strength of the relationship between a teacher and student can lead to more trust. When students trust their teacher and have a positive, warm relationship with the teacher, they will feel more comfortable in their learning environment and may be more willing to take academic risks or ask questions.  T: Great! We also talked about how teachers can use the strategy of authentic listening to build rapport with students—what is authentic listening?  S: Authentic listening is a strategy to build rapport with students that includes the teacher giving full attention to conversations, demonstrating empathy, and suspending judgment so that the student can be fully heard.  T: That’s right. Authentic listening is just one strategy to build rapport with students. What strategies did you come up with for Mr. Merit to build rapport and to listen authentically to his student?  S: (Share Bellringer responses.)  T: Today we are going to spend additional time learning about some other trust-generating practices—also called trust generators—teachers can use to build trust and strengthen rapport.  S: (Define vocabulary in Student Guide.)  T: Today we are going to focus on five key trust generators (share slide with trust generators and definitions): Selective vulnerability:  Selectively sharing appropriate challenges or mistakes. Familiarity: Being a regular presence in the students’ lives.  Similarity of interests: Sharing with students’ similar likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc.  Concern: Showing interest in issues and events that are important to students. Competence: Demonstrating knowledge of a subject and how to teach it.   S: (Define vocabulary in Student Guide.)  T: Let’s take a closer look at what each of these trust generators mean in practice. Selective vulnerability can look like a lot of things. One common example is when teachers make a mistake in front of students. A math teacher may accidentally write that ½ is smaller than ¼ when ordering fractions. Being willing to address your mistake, change it, and move on from it shows students that it’s okay to make mistakes. When teachers show students that they are human and imperfect, respect and connection follow.   T: Can you think of a time you had to be selectively vulnerable? S: (Share answers, if applicable.)  S: (Take notes about selective vulnerability in Student Guide.)  T: Let’s also consider some non-examples. As the term suggests, when teachers are vulnerable with students, they should carefully select information that is appropriate for students. They should not overshare or share anything that is private or share anything that is any way inappropriate for the relationship between a teacher and student or the age group they are working with. Inappropriate sharing includes anything that might burden students and distract them from their learning. Things like health concerns or challenges in personal relationships, for example, shouldn’t be shared with students.   T: Trust is built when a teacher is seen as a regular part of the students’ life. Familiarity might look like running into students and families at a local grocery store or crossing paths with students during downtime at school, such as at class changes, lunchtime, or recess. Attending community events or sports games are additional ways familiarity can occur. Students develop a sense of familiarity with teachers when they see their teachers regularly.  S: (Take notes about familiarity in Student Guide.)  T: While it is OK to cross paths with students,  teachers should maintain professional boundaries. Teachers are role models for positive adult behavior whether in or outside of the classroom.   T: Turn and talk to your neighbor about a time where you were excited to see a teacher outside of school. What were you doing? Did you get to talk to them?  S: (Turn and talk.)  T: We often create bonds of personal connection with others who like and dislike the same things we do. Teachers who share their interests with students can build stronger connections with them. . Similar interests might include sports, hobbies, or even social interests. Teachers can find creative ways to share their interests with students, including the examples they provide in class or the items they keep in their classroom (college pennants, sports jerseys, posters of favorite bands, etc.)   T: Do you have a teacher with whom you share common interests? How did you find out you shared that interest?  S: (Share responses.)  S: (Take notes about similarity of interests in Student Guide.)  T: As with other trust generators, teachers should only share those interests that are age and school-appropriate and communicate something positive about the teacher.  T: Showing concern for others is another way that people build connections. Teachers can show concern by remembering and asking about important events or issues in students’ lives. Appropriate examples could include upcoming competitions, plays, or trips. What are other appropriate examples?  S: (Take notes about concern in Student Guide.)  T: It is important to remember to set your boundaries and respect the student’s boundaries. Avoid topics that are too personal or risk embarrassing the student.   T: Turn and talk to a neighbor about a time where a teacher remembered something important going on in your life. How did it make you feel?  S: (Turn and talk.)  T: Finally, a teacher who shows competence will generate trust with students. Competence includes skill, knowledge, and will help and support students. When teachers teach effectively and manage the class effectively, students will trust them. A teacher who demonstrates competence will be prepared to teach the class when the bell rings, will have all materials ready and accessible, and will be prepared to respond to student confusion or misunderstanding in multiple ways.   S: (Take notes about competence in Student Guide.)  T: On the other hand, teachers who are disorganized and scattered at the beginning of class, do not have materials ready or can’t find materials, or do now know their content well enough to teach it in a variety of ways or to address common misconceptions do not demonstrate competence and will not generate trust among their students.   T: How do you feel about learning when you know your teacher understands the material and is confident in teaching it? S: Answers will vary, but may include: secure, confident, able to ask questions, etc. | Student Guide PPT |
| 15 mins | Practice  T: Now it’s time to practice. You are going to read several non-example scenarios. You will identify which trust generators you think could be better used in the example, and how. There may be more than one trust generator that needs to be used for each scenario. You will first work for 6 minutes on your own and then compare answers with a partner. Find the practice section in your student guide and begin.  S: (Find Practice: Scenario Analysis and begin activity.)  T: (Set timer for 6 mins)  T: Now it’s time to compare your answers with a partner. You have 5 minutes for comparison.   S: (Find partner and compare and discuss answers.)  T: Now that you’ve had time to discuss with a peer, I will give you the answers. (Read answers.) Any questions?   S: (Ask about any scenarios they do not understand.)  T: (Explain correct answers, as necessary.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Consider your field site placements. How might you use some of the strategies we’ve discussed today to better build relationships with your students?  S: (Provide examples of how they will use the trust generators with their students, answers will vary.) | Student Guide |
