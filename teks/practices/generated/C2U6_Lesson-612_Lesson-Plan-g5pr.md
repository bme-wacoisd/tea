| Rationale/ Summary | When a teacher has access to high-quality, aligned instructional materials, they must internalize the lessons to understand all the aligned components and how to effectively deliver direct instruction, set up practice, and execute lesson components. In this lesson, students will internalize the content of a lesson from HQIM and prepare to teach it; they will deliver the lesson and receive feedback in subsequent classes. | When a teacher has access to high-quality, aligned instructional materials, they must internalize the lessons to understand all the aligned components and how to effectively deliver direct instruction, set up practice, and execute lesson components.

|  | Prior to this lesson, consider how you will provide students with the sample lesson materials: Math (A Story of Units Lesson Plan and Problem Set), Science (Seasonal Changes Lesson Plan and Resource Documents), and  ELA (Norse Mythology Lesson Plan). These resources are available with the supplemental materials for this unit and may be printed or distributed digitally. The excerpted lesson sections refer to lessons and ideas that came before. The selections were chosen to be executable in this short period of time. Students may raise questions about vocabulary, the content and/or how the instruction is intended to be delivered that you can answer to ensure there that you address any lack of prior knowledge about the unit or the content. | Sample Lessons |
| 3 mins | Bellringer:  What does a teacher need to think about when planning for instruction? You may write your response in paragraph form or create a list. | Student Guide PPT |
| 2 mins | T: (Solicit responses from student to the bell ringer question highlighting sample answers in the student guide answer key.) S: (Students provide answers.) T: The concept of alignment between standards, objectives, units, lessons, and assessments is one of the most important ways we can create a fair and effective system – from the classroom to the state-level. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Putting It All Together - Introduction  T: The last three lessons in this unit will give you a chance to prepare, deliver, and get feedback on a lesson. This will give you and chance to see and practice alignment in action.  T: Given what you know about learning, why do you imagine that practicing a lesson and getting feedback helps teachers – and in this case you – become better at teaching?  S: Practice with feedback is one of the main ways we learn things – so that applies to learning to teaching just like it applies to math, science, or any other subject.  T: The first thing we will do is give you a lesson to practice. I am going to assign you one of three lessons. Eventually, you will teach it to two other students in your triad who will act as third grade students and participate in your lesson and provide you feedback.  T: Turn in your student guide to the three lesson descriptors you see there.  English Language Arts: Norse Mythology, the “K”-sound, and homophones Third grade | Amplify Texas Elementary Literacy | Unit 6  | Lesson 1 (page 12) Math: Explore the relationship between human capital and income. Third grade | Eureka Math TEKS Edition | Module 6 | Lesson 1 (page 12) Science: Observe and compare the life cycle stages of organisms. Third grade | PhD Science TEKS Edition | Module 2 | Lesson 17 (page 184)  S: (Open to their student guide.)  T: Today, you will have time to prepare to teach the lesson, and in the two subsequent lessons, we will practice delivering the lessons and you will get feedback from your classmates. Note to teacher:  You may also allow students to select a lesson guided by their interests. If you do this, some students may be taught the same lesson they teach.  T:  Please count off by threes.  S: (Students count off by threes.)  T: Ones will have ELA, Twos will have Math, and Threes will have the Science Lesson. | Student Guide Sample Lessons |
| 15 mins | Reading the Lesson and Preparing to Teach  T: I’d first like you to read through your assigned lesson in preparation to teach it. Please notice that you will only be teaching a section of the lesson as described in your student guide in the Lesson Excerpt for Practice table.  T: Please use your preparation table in your student guide as you read your lesson to record the objectives, instruction, practice, and formative assessment.  S: (Students individually read their lesson using the preparation table to capture their notes).   T: (Circulate while students read and work doing checks for understanding and answering questions.) | Student Guide Sample Lessons |
| 5 mins | Debrief and Questions   T: Thank you all for reviewing your lesson plans in preparation for practicing tomorrow!  T: In the guide, we asked you to identify any outstanding questions. Are there any questions about the lessons themselves that need clarification?  S: (Students ask any outstanding questions.)  T: (Respond to student questions.) | Student Guide Sample Lessons |
| 10 mins | Pair-Up Practice  T: Tomorrow, you will teach your lesson to two classmates who have not read or prepared for your lesson.  T: Before we do that, we are going to give you a chance to prepare with another person who has the same lesson as you.  T: (Have students pair up – pairs of ones, twos, and threes who have the same lesson.)  T: In your pairs, I want you to rehearse the very first parts of the lesson – so you have some practice with how to start up for tomorrow. When one of you in the pair is presenting, have the other act as a student.  T: (Display rehearsal sections on PowerPoint). The rehearsal sections are as follows:  For ELA: Please rehearse instruction beginning at page 12, through the section where students read the words and tell you what letters to circle for /k/. For Math: Please rehearse the instruction for Problem 1 on page 12. For Science: Please rehearse the Launch through the first butterfly life cycle sort (page 184 – 185).  T: I am going to give you 4 minutes each to practice this part. After 4 minutes, the other partner will practice.  S: (Student rehearse their above section with their partners.)  T: (At 4 minutes, tell the pair to switch their practice.) | Student Guide Sample Lessons |
|  | Debrief:  T: What worked well for you during your practice session?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: What did you learn during your practice session?  S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
