Intro to the Components of a Lesson Plan
Write the definitions and examples for each component of a lesson plan below as they are discussed in the lesson.


#### Practice 1: Lesson Analysis

Read Grade 2 Module 7 Lesson 6 . As you read, identify the components of a high-quality lesson plan. Identify how the standards, objectives, learning activities (introduction, direct instruction, guided practice, independent practice, and debrief), and assessment align.

Note: The standards are not listed on the lesson plan but are included in the topic overview.
The standards for Lesson 6 are as follows:

2.4A - Recall basic facts to add and subtract within 20 with automaticity.
2.4B - Add up to four two-digit numbers and subtract two-digit numbers using mental strategies and algorithms based on knowledge of place value and properties of operations.
2.5A - Determine the value of a collection of coins up to one dollar.


How are the standards, objectives, learning activities (introduction, direct instruction, guided practice, independent practice, and debrief), and assessment aligned?
