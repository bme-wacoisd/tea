Review the elements included in your portfolio and identify at least two that reflect the values you shared in your personal philosophy of education. What about them connects to how you described your own philosophy?



Introduction to the Portfolio Presentation
Create a PowerPoint presentation that share the key elements of your portfolio with your classmates and other stakeholders. Presentations should include (but are not limited to) the following components:
- Your “Why” as it relates to teaching. (Why the profession matters, why you are considering pursuing the profession.)
- A Personal Philosophy of Education.
- Reflections on your practice through your field experiences, including:
- one situation that demonstrates a personal strength in your approach to teaching.
- one situation where you see an area where you grew in your approach to teaching through this course.
- Identify at least 2 artifacts that reflect the values you shared in your philosophy of education and explain how they do so. This may include:
- Classroom Management Plan
- Lesson Plans
- Sample Assessments
- Outline your goals for pursuing a career in education and a plan for how you hope to achieve these goals.
Effective presentations also consider:
- Organization and Structure: The presentation is developed in a focused, creative, and coherent way.
- Content: The presentation addresses all required components and provides appropriate elaboration around each element.
- Design: The presentation is visually appealing, using colors, images, and graphics to strengthen the quality of the final product.
- Language and Delivery: The presenter speaks clearly, effectively, and confidently (e.g., volume, pace, articulation) in a presentation that does not exceed 10 minutes.
