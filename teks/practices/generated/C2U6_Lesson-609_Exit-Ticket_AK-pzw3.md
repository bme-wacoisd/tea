### Lesson 6.09: Scaffolding a Lesson | Modeling, Part II

Name:
Date:
Review the scenario below to determine whether it meets the characteristics of effective modeling. If the criteria are not met, provide a suggestion for improvement.
A 1st grade teacher is teaching her students how to solve addition problems by making a bar model. The teacher introduces the following word problem:
Tom has 5 books in a box. He puts 3 more books in the box. How many books are in the box?
The teacher does a think aloud for the following question: What do we need to find? She explains that we need to find how many books are in the box. She then asks students to think about what information from the word problem they need to use. The teacher underlines important information in the word problem, such as 5 books and 3 more books. The teacher then draws a bar model to show students how to put the information they found in the word problem into a bar model. Last, the teacher wrote the equation 5 + 3 = 8.


8
5 + 3 = 8

How does teacher modeling help build student understanding and mastery of the standard?
- Teacher modeling helps build student understanding by scaffolding the concepts and skills into learnable steps. Modeling allows students to see how to perform each step of a process as well as understand the connections between each step and why each step is important. Modeling also reduces cognitive overload by breaking down task that may be too cognitively demanding for students.


| 5 | 3 |
| --- | --- |


| Criteria for Successful Modeling | Scenario | Suggestion for Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Break down the skill into learnable steps | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The teacher walked students through each step of the process for solving a word problem using a bar model |  |
| Visually demonstrates the steps as students watch | Met Not Met  Reasoning:  The teacher visually showed students how to use a bar model to solve a word problem. |  |
| Verbally explain what the student is seeing as you model | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The teacher did a think aloud and underlined key information in the word problem as she discussed those steps. |  |
| Make important connections between the steps | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The teacher did not discuss important connects between the bar model and the equation. | The teacher could have discussed how the bar graph and the equation showed the same thing and represented the information in the word problem. |
| Check for student understanding along the way and re-model steps as necessary | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The teacher did not provide a check for understanding. | The teacher could have included a quick check for understanding to see if students understood the step to solving a word problem using a bar model. |
| Ensure pacing is just the right speed | Met Not Met  Reasoning: The lesson appeared to move at a quick pace to hold students’ engagement and build understanding. |  |
| Allow opportunities for students to ask questions and get clarification | Met Not Met  Reasoning: Students did not have the opportunity to ask questions or get clarification. | The teacher could have provided space for students to ask questions and get clarification |
