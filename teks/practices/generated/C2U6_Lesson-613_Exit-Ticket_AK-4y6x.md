Describe the alignment of instructional activities to the objective of one of lessons you experienced today as a student by answering the following two questions:
What was the lesson’s objective?
How did the instructional activities (direct instruction, practice, and formative assessments) align to that objective?
Science: Observe and compare the life cycle stages of organisms.
- Objective: Observe and compare the life cycle stages of different organisms.
- The instruction aligns by including practice of placing different organism’s life cycle in order and the student must observe and compare different examples.
- They are formatively assessed as the teacher is both able to see how they arrange the life cycle, and they ask questions such as “How can we learn more about the life cycles of other organisms?”
Math Practice Lesson: Explore the relationship between human capital and income.
- Objective: Explore the relationship between human capital and income.
- Throughout the lesson, the teacher explains how some jobs have different incomes.
- Students practice and are formatively assessed when they look at Ben’s table (which clearly shows the relationship between jobs and income and educational level) and are asked questions about the table; Additionally, they are then asked to practice with problem sets that help them apply the ideas they have learned about the connection of education to earning potential.
English Language Arts Practice Lesson: Norse Mythology, the “K”-sound, and homophones
- Objectives:
Students will categorize words using different spelling patterns for /k/.
- Students will identify homophones.
- All the activities introduce students to the 5 different spelling patterns for /k/.
- The students get to practice and identify what part of the word produces the /k/ sound and then chart that.
- They are introduced the idea of homophones through the example of course and coarse and then are able to practice by coming up with a list other homophones.
- Throughout the practice, the teacher is calling on students and can informally formatively assess whether they are able to categorize words using different spelling patterns for /k/ and identify homophones.
