Bellringer:
In unit 8, you were introduced to the concept of student conferences.  In that that unit, one of the characteristics of a student conference was that they included attention to the student’s emotions about learning.  Why is it important to attend to student emotions in conferences, especially when giving feedback?
It can be scary and uncomfortable for some students to receive feedback or talk with a teacher one on one.  Attending to student emotions about learning allows the teacher to create the safety required to allow the feedback to be received in a positive manner.
Communicating Feedback
How can teachers help to make sure feedback is received positively?
Create regular opportunities to give and receive feedback.
Create a safe space for feedback to be given and received.
Provide the purpose for the feedback.
Explain the process for giving/receiving feedback.
Explain how the feedback will help students to improve.

Benefits of 1:1 Conferences with students
- Alleviate misunderstandings about feedback or content.
- Build student confidence.
- Reduce student anxieties.
Planning for 1:1 Conferences with students
Schedule conferences regularly and keep them short (5 minutes or less)
Before the conference, plan out what you will share as strengths/areas of improvement. Also have the students reflect on their strengths/struggles before the conference.
At the conference, be sure to greet your student. Briefly explain how the conference will go.
Share your main thoughts on their progress/work.  Keep your thoughts to three points or less, starting with the positive.
End with a goal for the next conference





Model-1:1 Student Conferences

Scenario: A class of 5th grade students have recently been working on their argumentative writing.  Ms. Jeffries, their teacher, assigned the students a reading passage about school gardens.  The students were then asked to generate questions about the costs and benefits of school gardens and allowed to conduct research on the topic.  As a summative task the students were asked to write a multi-paragraph letter to convince their school principal to allow a school garden. The students must clearly state their claim, support the claim with evidence from the passage or their research to develop those ideas, attend to the organization of the writing (beginning, middle and end) and utilize appropriate spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

Mrs. Jefferies has completed the grading of the task and is meeting with each student in the class in a 1:1 conference to discuss feedback.  Prior to the conference, she has asked each student to reflect on their work and identify areas of strength and areas where they need to improve based on the success criteria shared.  She also asked the students to reflect where this assignment went well and where they struggled with it.

Mrs. Jefferies is planning to meet with a student, Roberta, at the beginning of the class.  She is reviewing the writing sample submitted by Roberta and considering the feedback that she should give Roberta.  Roberta has established a clear claim that the school should have a garden but has struggled a bit with the organization of her writing and clearly supporting the claim with evidence from the passage.  After sharing reasons why the school should have a garden, Roberta also explains the “bad things” that should be overlooked.  Roberta includes a conclusion to the letter where she invites the principal to consider the good and overlook the bad and make the right choice.


Practice: Planning for 1:1 Conferences
Scenario: The students in Mr. Blankenship’s 6th grade science classes have been examining the differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures.  As a summative assessment, Mr. Blankenship asked the students to make a 2–3-minute video presentation to teach younger students about the differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures.  In the video should show at least three examples of each classification and students should explain the basis for the classification of each example using appropriate science vocabulary.  Because the video targets younger students as the audience, it should be fun and engaging and simple enough for the younger students to understand.
Shawn, a student in Mr. Blankenship’s class, completed his assignment and submitted his video.  In his video, Shawn pretended to be a scientist investigating “mystery” substances around the house.  With his dog as a sidekick, he provided three examples of each classification.  In his description of the classification, he accidentally mixed up the definitions of compounds and mixtures but the examples he provided were correctly classified.  His video also lasted 6:30, well over the allotted time of 2-3 minutes.
Mr. Blankenship will be meeting with all his students to review his feedback of the video project.  Prior to the conference, students were asked to self-assess their projects to identify areas of strength along with ways they could improve their work.  Based on the information provided, help Mr. Blankenship prepare for his conference with Shawn using the planning document below.
