Recap the central components of instructional alignment by completing the table.

Summary Table on Instructional Alignment




| Instructional Component | What it is? | What does it mean for this component to align to the other components? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standards (TEKS) | Learning goals or expectations for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level | This is the starting point for all alignment – set at the state level for each course. Everything else needs to align to standards. |
| Objectives | Brief statements that describe what students will be expected to learn by the end of the unit or lesson | Aligning objectives means ensuring that these taken together reflect the standards. |
| Lesson Plans | A teacher’s detailed plan for teaching an individual lesson | Lesson plans must be aligned to achieving the objective – with instruction and practice that requires students to learn and practice the objective. |
| Modeled Instruction | The part of the lesson where the teacher demonstrates how to perform a skill while describing each step with a rationale. | Demonstrations must be aligned to objectives for the day. |
| Deliberate Practice | Practice that performs the learning goal (authentic), is spaced over time, is low-stakes and is paired with feedback for improvement | Practice must align to the instruction (meaning be a chance to identically apply the skill or knowledge a teacher has taught.) |
| Assessment | Any tool used to collect, analyze, and respond to information about student understanding of learning targets | Assessments are a final version of independent practice that determines whether you have met the aligned objective and can demonstrate that independently. |
