| Rationale/ Summary | Learners perceive and comprehend information that is presented to them in different ways; therefore, there isn’t one means of representation that will work for every learner. In this lesson, students will define multiple means of representation and learn about strategies to provide options for perception and language and symbols, which are two of the UDL guidelines for representation. With teacher support, students will analyze a lesson to evaluate its use of multiple means of representation and determine how the use of those strategies deepen understanding for all students. | Learners perceive and comprehend information that is presented to them in different ways; therefore, there isn’t one means of representation that will work for every learner.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will examine a nonexample lesson plan to evaluate its use of multiple modes of representation. Students will make suggestions for ways the teacher might include multiple means of representation through perception and language and symbols.  See Exit Ticket – Answer Key for exemplar response. | Students will examine a nonexample lesson plan to evaluate its use of multiple modes of representation.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Read the directions below and then answer the related questions.   Lisez les instructions puis répondez à la question.  What do you think the sentence is saying?  What helped you to make your guess?  How could the directions be made easier to understand? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share your guess, the strategies you used to make sense of the sentence and ideas for making the directions easier to understand. If you are in an even row, your partner is the person in front of you.   S: (Turn and talk.)  T: What were some of the strategies that helped you understand pieces of this sentence?   S: (Answers will vary but students will likely point out the words that are similar in both French and English.)  T: What else would help you make sense of these directions?   S: (Answers will vary.) |  |
| 10 mins | Guideline – Language & Symbols  T: Today, we are going to focus on options for language and symbols. This means that a teacher provides alternative explanations and representations for both key language and terms used in the classroom as well as symbols used.   T: Let’s look at what this guideline might look like in the classroom using this short video clip. As you watch, record notes on the different strategies for language and symbols in the graphic organizer in your student guide. (Share video. Pause after each guideline to allow students to record notes in student guide and provide nonexamples. Stop video at 2:03.)  S: (Take notes on student guide.)   Adapted from CAST (2018). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.2. Retrieved from http://udlguidelines.cast.org T: Let’s consider two different examples of a math lesson to see these guidelines in action. Find the example in your student guide. In these examples, both teachers are teaching students how to balance 1-step equations.  S: (Find example in student guide.)  T: Who will read the Teacher A scenario?   S: (Volunteer reads the scenario.)  T: Who will read the Teacher B scenario?   S: (Volunteer reads the scenario.)  Teacher A: Pre-teaches new vocabulary and symbols using a Frayer model. Students physically model the concept of balance and explore different ways to represent an equation story including the story itself, a scale balance, a graph, and an equation.  Teacher B: Students record definitions from the board and students practice solving 1-step equations using a learned procedure.  T: Which approach is most effective and why?  S: Teacher A because the teacher pre-teaches vocabulary and symbols using a graphic organizer. Students physically model the concept and think of different ways to represent a balanced equation. Teacher B asks students to copy definitions, which doesn’t help them engage with the words, and solve problems using a learned procedure, which doesn’t help them understand the concept. Because students in Teacher A’s class are seeing this concept in multiple ways, they will likely gain a deeper understanding of the words and the concept.  T: How do these guidelines support multiple means of representation? S: These strategies help clarify meaning and deepen understanding of difficult vocabulary, symbols, and content using visuals, video, audio, charts, and tactile objects, which makes learning accessible for all learners.  T: How could a teacher use technology to support the different strategies for language & symbols?  S: Online dictionaries to support vocabulary development, online translation tools to connect vocabulary and concepts to a student’s heritage language, digital graphic organizers. | UDL A Representation Language Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmnPiU6dMns |
| 16 mins | Practice – Role Play  T: Now it’s your turn to practice introducing vocabulary using options for language and symbols using the following checklist:  Provide a definition of the word. Share examples of how to use the word in a sentence.  Make connections to other languages (translations, cognates). Use multi-media and non-linguistic supports (pictures, videos, movement, etc.).  T: You are going to work in group of 3 to practice. (Move students into pre-assigned groups of 3.)  S: (Move to their assigned groups.)  T: Each person in your group will have a different scenario. You will have a few minutes to prepare and then each person in your group will have a 4-minute practice period to introduce one key vocabulary word.   T: Now you will have 4 minutes to read your scenario and do a little planning. Your scenarios will give you some ideas for how to introduce the word. Use the checklist to plan additional strategies. (Set and start timer.)  S: (Complete individual planning.)  T: It’s time to begin your role play. Decide who will go first.   S: (Decide who will go first.)  T: I am going to set the timer for 4 minutes. After the teacher is finished, the students will provide feedback using the checklist. (Set and start timer.)  S: (Engage in round 1 of role play. Provide feedback.)  T: Your time for round 1 is up. Determine who will go next. You have 4 minutes. (Set and start timer.)  S: (Engage in round 2 of role play. Provide feedback.)  T: Your time for round 2 is up. You should be on your last role play. You have 4 minutes. (Set and start timer.)  S: (Engage in round 3 of role play. Provide feedback.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: What were some of the strategies suggested in your scenario for introducing vocabulary?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: What additional strategies did you plan for and use?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Why is it important to pre-teach and use options for language and symbols?   S: Pre-teaching vocabulary helps make a lesson more accessible to students. Using multiple options provides alternative ways for students to engage with the words. This helps meet all students’ needs and provides multiple opportunities to retrieve information and move understanding from short term to long term memory. |  |
