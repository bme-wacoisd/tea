### Lesson 3.01:  The Importance of Learning About Students

Name:
Date:

It is the beginning of the school year and Ms. M has a class full of new students in her third grade reading class. She asks her students to take a survey so she can get to know what students like and dislike, both in and out of school. She is in the process of conducting home visits to meet families and to get to know what life at home is like for her students. One of her students, Maria, shared in her student survey that she does not read very much  but enjoys being outside. When Ms. M did Maria’s home visit, she noticed that Maria did not have many books at home and the ones she had were all in Spanish. Maria’s parents, who are not fluent English speakers, shared with Ms. M that Maria is an outgoing girl who likes being with her friends.
What did Ms. M. learn about Maria:
as an individual?
as a learner?
as a member of her family?

What can Ms. M. do to encourage Maria to read more?
