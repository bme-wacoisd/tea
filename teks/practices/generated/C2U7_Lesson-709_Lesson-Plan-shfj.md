| 4 mins | Bellringer:   What do you remember about the characteristics of effective questions?  How does the use of meaningful questions lead to cognitive engagement and student understanding? How do teachers use questioning to inform their instruction? | Student Guide |
| 1 min | T: Let’s review what you know about questions. What do you remember about the characteristics of effective questions? (Call on a few students to share their thoughts.) S: Effective questions should be meaningful and understandable, focus on the most important content, align to the level of thinking required in the learning target, and increase in complexity and demand as learning progresses.   T: How do meaningful and effective questions lead to cognitive engagement and increased understanding?   S: Using meaningful questions forces students to think critically and elaborate as opposed to providing a one-word response. It pushes students to make connections and draw on their prior knowledge and learning.  T: How do teachers use questioning to inform their instruction?   S: Questions can be a part of both formal and informal assessments that help teachers reflect on their instruction and make key decisions about next steps. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Intro to Questioning  T: In the Science of Learning unit, we discussed directive and non-directive prompts. What were directive prompts and non-directive prompts?  S: Directive prompts were questions to guide students to think further in a specific way. Non-directive prompts are phrases to push students to further develop an idea without suggesting what to add.  T: How does the use of meaningful questions, such as these lead to cognitive engagement?   S: It forces students to think critically and elaborate as opposed to providing a one-word response. It pushes students to make connections and draw on their prior knowledge and learning.  T: (Share via PPT while students take notes in student guide.)  T: Questioning is an important part of the classroom because it: Encourages extended student response  Engages students in effective class discussions Fosters student involvement Facilitates a positive, active learning environment Helps teachers to challenge students and learn more about how they think.  Helps teachers to understand what students know/don’t know  T: Questioning can look different depending on the purpose. In the assessment unit, we looked at a model – the Question Matrix – to help us begin to consider how to build questions to become more complex over the course of a lesson. Today, we are going to go deeper by looking at another model – Bloom’s Taxonomy. Bloom’s is a model used to classify thinking into levels of rigor or complexity. It helps a teacher consider the level of thinking, action or knowledge a student must use to answer a question or accomplish a task. It also helps the teacher consider the various ways a question can be answered or ways a task can be completed.   T: What do you notice about this model?       S: The bottom levels are more simplistic because they only require students to remember and explain concepts, whereas the top levels require more cognitive engagement by requiring students to justify their thoughts and create new or original work based on their learning.   T: Yes - This hierarchical image shows how the level of complexity and level of thinking required moves from simplest (remembering) to the most complex (create).    T: The higher levels of the Bloom’s model are generally more cognitively engaging.  They require students to organize a body of knowledge and understand how it works together, think about why something happens, think about how something happens, and compare and contrast ideas.    T: One thing to note is that just because the lower levels of Bloom’s require less cognitive engagement, it doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be used. As we already know, it is important to engage students in different types of questions and for questions to build in complexity over the course of a lesson. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Types of Questioning  T: One way for a teacher to determine what type of question to use is to first consider the purpose. Let’s look at four different types of questions and when each type might be used.  T: (Share via PPT as students record notes in student guide.)  T: (Discuss each type of question, the corresponding levels of Bloom’s, the purpose, and example/nonexamples as indicated in the PPT.)  T: Lower-level questions require students to recall or restate information that is relatively easy to give.   T: Lower-level questions are useful when a teacher wants to review information or check basic knowledge. Lower-level questions are not bad, but they can be overused. Teachers should vary the use of question type.  T: Higher-level questions require students to look beyond the surface of information and use their critical- thinking skills to analyze, explain or interpret knowledge.   T: Closed questions have a limited number of acceptable answers and are useful to check students’ understanding. Typically, closed questions will be lower level, but there will be times when they can be higher-level, such as with multiple choice test questions. Here is an example: What is the meaning of “tear” as it is used in the text?   T: Although there will only be one correct answer, students must analyze the use of the word “tear” in the passage to determine its meaning.     T: Open questions have many acceptable answers and promote deeper thinking and building of connections. Typically, open questions will be higher level, but there will be times when an open question might be lower level.  Here is an example: How would you describe a metamorphic rock?  T: A student simply must recall the characteristics of a metamorphic rock but can describe it in multiple ways. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice #1: Guided Practice   T: Let’s look at a scenario to examine the questions the teacher plans to use for an upcoming activity.  Example from Grade 3 Lesson 1 Earth Changes Science Unit  A 3rd grade teacher is planning instruction for a science lesson with the following objectives:   Students will define land  Students will observe land areas and describe their natural features.   The teacher plans to use an inflatable globe model of Earth.  Students will pass the globe around the classroom and point to an area they think shows land. The teacher wants to ask questions during the activity and after the activity to gauge students understanding of land and find out how students decided which parts of the globe were land.   T: Let’s look at some of the questions this teacher drafted to determine if they meet her intended purpose. Here are the first two questions:  What is this an example of? Is this an example of land?  T: Are these two questions higher-level or lower-level?  S: Lower-level because they just ask students to recall information.   T: How might the teacher use this type of question?  S: To assess student’s basic understanding of land vs water.    T: Are these questions open or closed?  S: Closed because they require a simple response with a limited number of responses or a yes/no response.  T: Let’s look at the next question:  How did you decide which parts of the globe were land?   T: Is this an example of a higher-level or lower-level question?  S: Higher-level  T: How do you know?  S: Students must explain how they decided which parts of the globe where land and justify their response with evidence.   T: Is this question open or closed? How do you know?  S: Open because it allows for a variety of acceptable answers and allows students space to build connections.  T: We also want to think about how students might respond to this question. In this case, students might say “I know where we live is land, so I picked a place that looked the same.”  T: Why might a teacher ask a question like this?  S: To force students to elaborate on why they said a certain place on the globe was land.   T: Yes – asking students to explain how they decided which part was land requires students to think more deeply and critically about the content.   T: Let’s look at another question the teacher drafted:  What information do you think a globe gives us about land?   T: Is this an open-ended or closed-ended question?  S: Open-ended because the answer isn’t limited.  T: Is this higher-level or lower-level?  S: Higher-level because it forces students to think about the different features of the globe and what those different features represent.   T: How might students respond to that question?  S: It shows that some places of land are connected to each other, some areas of land are really big and some are really small.  T: Why might a teacher use this type of question here?  S: To encourage students to think more deeply and critically about the purpose of a globe and what useful information they can gather from a globe. It could encourage discussion between peers.   T: The next question the teacher has planned is:  Why is it difficult to describe land using only a globe?   T: Is this a higher-level or lower-level question?  S: Higher-level because it requires students to differentiate between the information they can get from a globe versus the information they can get from somewhere else.  T: Is this question open or closed?  S: Open because students can respond in a variety of ways.  T: How might students respond?  S: Students might respond by saying that the globe only shows where land is and what is around it or that we can’t tell if one place looks like another in real life.    T: Why might the teacher ask this question here?  S: To encourage students to think more deeply and critically about the features of the land and think about whether a globe can help them better understand the different features. It requires students to use prior knowledge and understanding to respond.  T: The teacher planned this follow-up question to the previous question:  What other tools could you use to help you describe land?   T: Is this higher-level or lower-level?  S: Higher-level because students have to think about what other tools they could use to help them describe land.  T: Yes – and this question would be closed because there are a limited number of tools students can use to describe land.   T: Why might the teacher ask this question here?  S: To encourage students to think about what other tools could help them describe land. It requires students to use prior knowledge and understanding to respond.  T: The final question the teacher ask is:  How would you describe land?  T: This is an example of a lower-level, open-ended questions because students simply must recall the characteristics of land, but they can describe it in different ways.  T: Why might the teacher ask this question here?  S: To check students understanding of the characteristics of land.  T: Did the different questions align with the teacher’s purpose which was to ask questions to gauge students understanding of land and find out how students decided which parts of the globe were land?  S: Yes, the teacher was able to see if students could identify land and explain how they knew it was land.   T: How were the questions sequenced to build student’s understanding?  S: The questions went from simple recall to more complex.  T: Yes – the questions started with simple closed questions, but those questions helped assess students’ prior understanding of land in order to build to more complex questions, which required students to think critically about why it is difficult to describe land using only a globe.  T: Remember that lower-level and closed questions can be useful when assessing basic understanding and prior knowledge to move students toward more complex questions that require critical thinking, problem solving, and building of connections as we saw in the previous example. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice #2 T: With a partner, read the following scenario and examine the questions the teacher plans to use for an upcoming lesson. Identify if the questions are higher-level or lower level, if the questions are open or closed, and explain the teacher’s purpose for using each question.  Example Questions adapted from Eureka Grade 3 Module 7 Lesson 14  Scenario:  Ms. Green is planning instruction for a lesson with the following objective: Students will solve word problems to determine perimeter with given side lengths.   She plans to use questions to quickly assess student understanding of the concept and ask questions that will require students to thinking more deeply and apply their learning to different situations. Below is the example problem and the questions she plans to ask students. Possible student responses are in parentheses.  Mrs. Kozlow put a border around a 5-foot by 6-foot rectangular bulletin board. How many feet of border did Mrs. Kozlow use?  S: (Complete practice activity in student guide). | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let’s review your responses to the different questions you analyzed.  S: (Students share answers from practice activity). Exemplar responses in answer key.  T: How were different question types used to help build student understanding?   S: The teacher planned to use a mix of lower-level questions to access basic student understanding and to help build up to the higher-level questions that asked students to think more critically about the math problem.   T: How can lower-level questions be used to help guide student understanding?  S: It helps assess prior knowledge and understanding so the teacher knows where to build background knowledge to get to more higher-level questions.  T: How does high-quality questioning support student understanding?  S: High-quality questioning helps encourages student responses, engages students in effective discussions, fosters student involvement, facilitates a positive, active learning environment, and helps teachers to understand what students know/don’t know. Higher-level and opened ended questions activates students critical thinking skills to build their understanding of the concepts. | Student Guide |
