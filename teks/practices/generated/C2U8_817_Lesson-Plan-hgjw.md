| Rationale/ Summary | In this lesson, the last student will practice delivering the lessons they planned and get feedback on their lesson delivery. Additionally, this lesson will give the students an opportunity to reflect on their teaching using the UDL guidelines and the necessity for universal design for learning. | In this lesson, the last student will practice delivering the lessons they planned and get feedback on their lesson delivery.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will reflect on the lesson planning process and their performance while delivering the lesson. Students will identify the UDL strategies they used and explain how those strategies support the needs of all the students, including individuals and small subgroups, such as English Language Learners and gifted students. Students will determine how the use of these strategies differ from an approach that teaches to the average student.

| Vocabulary | Universal Design for Learning (UDL) | Universal Design for Learning (UDL) | An educational framework to guide the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences through engagement, representation, and expression. UDL minimizes barriers and maximizes learning for all students. |
| Vocabulary | Multiple Means of Engagement | Multiple Means of Engagement | Providing various ways of engaging with material to stimulate interest and motivation for learning |
| Vocabulary | Multiple Means of Representation | Multiple Means of Representation | Presenting information and content in different ways to support learning for all students. |
| Vocabulary | Multiple Means of Action & Expression | Multiple Means of Action & Expression | Offering options for ways students can interact with the instructional material, demonstrate their learning, and express what they know |

|  | Note: For this lesson, you will need to set up stations around the room – a number to accommodate groups of three and, if possible, give each triad access to a section of white board. Alternatively, students can use a personal white board, projected computer, or even a sheet of paper for sections of the lesson that involve writing). |  |
| 3 mins | Bellringer: What is the purpose of the UDL guidelines? What does a teacher need to consider when trying to plan a lesson using the UDL guidelines? |  |
| 2 mins | T: What is the purpose of the UDL guidelines? S: To ensure all learners can access and participate in meaningful and challenging learning experiences.  T: What does a teacher need to consider when trying to plan a lesson using the UDL guidelines? S: A teacher must consider the perspectives, preferences, abilities, and skills of the students in their classroom, so they can ensure the learning is accessible for all students. | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Round Three: Practice Teach  T: (Set up stations around the room – a number to accommodate groups of three and, if possible, give each triad access to a section of white board. Alternatively, students can use a personal white board, projected computer or even a sheet of paper for sections of the lesson that involve writing.)  Note: Larger groups may be preferable if class size and time allows.  T: The last teacher from your group will get to practice their lesson today.   T: (Send students back to their groups of three; ensure that students take their lesson materials when they move into groups.)  S: (Students move back to their groups of three.)  T:  I want to quickly recap the process we used from yesterday.  T: (Display PPT.) Our time will be broken up in the following way:  Rehearsal Plan 9 minutes to teach the lesson with other two classmates acting as students. 4 minutes to record reflections on your experience, using either the teacher reflection table or the student reflection table in your student guide. 2 minutes to share feedback with the teacher. 2 minutes for the teacher to reflect on teaching the lesson  T: Alright, let’s conduct another round.  We will start with 9 minutes of rehearsal teaching.  T: (Display timer with 9 minutes giving the third “teachers” a chance to teach their lesson using the above timing.)  T: Begin teaching your lesson!  S: (Students engage in lesson rehearsal.)  T: (At 9 minutes, teacher stops the rehearsing teachers.)  T: Now let’s move to 4 minutes to record reflections in the teacher table or the student table in your student guide.  S: (Students reflect in their guides for 4 minutes.)  T: Now I’d ask those of you who participated as students to share some of the feedback with your teacher.  Be as specific as possible.  S: (Students share feedback for the teacher.)  T: Finally, let’s give the teacher a chance to share their reflections on the experience of teaching the lesson.  S: (“Teacher” shares their reflection on the lesson.) | Student Guide PPT Third Grade Lesson Samples |
| 15 mins | Reflecting  T: Finally, today, I’d like us to reflect on and debrief the practice together. During this debrief, I’d like you to share about your own experiences or any feedback that you received from your “students.” Do not feedback about those who taught you.  T: As we discuss, I will capture our collective experiences on the white board in a three-column chart that is parallel to the focus areas we looked for in the reflection tables – the UDL strategies used, how the strategies impacted student learning, and additional strategies or alternatives that could have been included. Please use the class debrief reflection table to take notes in your student guide to capture our discussion.  T: First, let’s discuss the UDL strategies used in the different lessons.  Referring to your reflections and the feedback you heard from your students, what successes and challenges did you experience with incorporating the UDL guidelines?  S: (Students share their experiences.)  T: (Chart students’ responses in the table.)  T: The second focus area was how the UDL guidelines impacted student learning. How do you feel the use of the UDL guidelines impacted student learning?  S: (Students share their experiences.)  T: (Chart students’ responses in the table.)  T: What additional UDL strategies or alternatives could have been used in the lesson?  S: (Students share their experiences.)  T: (Chart students’ responses in the table.)  T: I appreciate all your reflections on your rehearsal teaching and experiences. In many ways, this reflective activity serves as a helpful formative assessment of your experience with teaching and gives both you and I a sense of successes and challenges that we will build on as we rehearse moving forward. | Student Guide |
