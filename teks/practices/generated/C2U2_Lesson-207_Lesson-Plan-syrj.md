| Rationale/ Summary | People tend to be motivated by the positive far more than the negative. It is important to guide students to do better while motivating and inspiring them to evaluate their effort by redirecting them in ways that communicate trust and maintain privacy. In this lesson, students will learn about Positive Framing to frame interactions, particularly corrections, in a way that reinforces trust, while still guiding students toward a better course of action.  This is the last of two lessons on Positive Framing: Frame Redirections Positively. In this lesson, students will learn how to Allow Plausible Anonymity by analyzing examples of this technique in action and drafting an Allow Plausible Anonymity statement for a scenario. | People tend to be motivated by the positive far more than the negative.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Scenario: You signal that you’d like students to stop their independent work and turn their attention to a peer, but two students are still working on their assignments. Practice crafting a statement that Assumes the Best and Allows Plausible Anonymity at the same time. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Scenario: You signal that you’d like students to stop their independent work and turn their attention to a peer, but two students are still working on their assignments.

|  | Prior to beginning this lesson, ensure you can access the following videos:  Frame Redirections Positively: Patrick Pastore |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Based on what you have learned so far, why is it important to redirect students by assuming the best? How can Assume the Best impact classroom culture and build positive relationships with students? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Debrief: Turn and Talk T: Take one minute to turn to a partner and discuss your bellringer answers. S: (Share answers with partner) T: Would anyone like to share out their thoughts? T: (Call on students to share) | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Review: Six Rules of Positive Framing:  T: Before we start with new material today, let’s do a quick review of the Six Rules of Positive Framing. When I call on you, name one of the six rules.  S: (Name the six rules as called upon.) Live in the Now Assume the Best Allow Plausible Anonymity Narrate the Positive and Build Momentum Challenge! Talk Expectations and Aspirations |  |
| 5 mins | Notes: Plausible Anonymity T: We are now going to focus on how to Allow Plausible Anonymity. Remember to record your notes in your Student Guide. (Use the PPT to guide this section of the lesson.)    T: When students are trying to meet your expectations, it is important to redirect as privately as possible. Why would privately redirecting students be important?  S:  It does not risk embarrassing the student and helps build trust between the teacher and student.  T: (Cold call or ask for students to read the success criteria for Plausible Anonymity.)  S: (Reads from PPT.) Redirects students without using their names: Keeping redirections anonymous helps to eliminate attention-seeking behavior. Additionally, for students who are making a good-faith effort to meet expectations, redirecting anonymously both acknowledges their efforts and still upholds expectations. Maintains Economy of Language: Using fewer words helps students to focus on what they need to do to meet expectations and brings everyone back to the lesson as quickly as possible. Maintains Emotional Constancy: Again, it’s wise to use a neutral tone when delivering redirections of any kind. |  |
| 7 mins | Practice 1: Examples and Non-Examples  T: Let’s look at some phrases you can use to ensure plausible anonymity. (Via PPT, share some of the TLAC back-pocket phrases for Allow Plausible Anonymity from Texas TLAC Online).   S: (Read the phrases independently.)  T:  How do these examples align with the success criteria?  S: The phrases use few words, are easy to deliver in a neutral tone, and can be delivered without naming individual students.    T: Note that if a student does not realize you are talking to them, you might want to use eye contact as you make your statement or stand next to that student as you speak. Remember that smiling and scanning after you Assume the Best and Allow Plausible Anonymity communicates to students that you truly believe they want to do their best work. It shows your belief in their commitment to their own education.   Upgrade the nonexample T: You will now look at a statement that does not meet the success criteria. Work with a partner to identify how the statement does not meet the success criteria and adjust the statement to improve it.  S: (Review and revise the non-example with a partner.)  T: (Circulate through the room as students work to upgrade the statements. Check for and provide feedback on students’ understanding of how the statements meet or do not meet the criteria.)  T: Let me hear some examples. Who would like to share?   S: (Student pairs volunteer responses.) |  |
| 5 mins | Practice 2: Video Analysis T: As you watch a video example, look for examples of the teacher redirecting students without using their names and how he maintains emotional constancy.    S: (Record notes in the Student Guide.)  Whole group discussion T: Why is it important to maintain anonymity to the greatest extent possible?   S: It eliminates attention-seeking behavior. It acknowledges the efforts for students who are making a good-faith effort. | TLAC Video: Frame Redirections Positively: Patrick Pastore  Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Practice 3: Role Play  T: You will now plan and deliver a redirection focusing on Allow Plausible Anonymity with a partner. Find the scenario on your student guide. As you plan, ensure the redirection: Doesn’t name individual students Maintains Economy of Language Maintains Emotional Constancy  S: (Work with a partner to plan redirection.)  T: With your partner, find another pair for feedback. Choose one partner to deliver your redirection. Other students will provide feedback using the rubric in their student guide. |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: (Show students the example statement provided from Texas TLAC Online via PPT.)   "Pause. Eyes on me, please. If you forgot to put on your goggles, please make sure you have them on now." (Smile and look for follow-through.) "Thank you."  T: How does the statement you crafted compare to the one provided?   S: (Responses will vary.)  T: How did the example maintain anonymity and maintain economy of language?  S: The teacher did not name specific students but made a general statement to all students as a reminder to put on their goggles. The teacher kept the redirection short to keep the focus on the academics. |  |
