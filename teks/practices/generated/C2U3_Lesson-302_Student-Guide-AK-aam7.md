Bellringer: For each strategy teachers use to learn about their students, list how that strategy helps teachers plan effective instruction.


#### Importance of Building Trust and Rapport

What is rapport? Rapport is a relationship characterized by mutual understanding or empathy that makes communication possible or easy.

Why do you think it matters for teachers to build trust and rapport with students?
Answers will vary but may include:
Building trust and rapport will make students feel more comfortable in class.
Students are more likely to care about classes where the teacher cares about students as individuals.

How might trusting relationships lead to a positive impact on student learning?
Answers will vary but may include:
If students trust teachers, they will be more likely to ask questions when they do not understand.
Trusting relationships between students and teachers can help teachers get to know students beyond the classroom, giving teachers insight on how to make connections between students’ lives and classroom content.

#### Using Authentic Listening to Build Trust and Rapport

What is authentic listening? Authentic listening is a strategy to build rapport with students that includes the teacher giving full attention to conversations, demonstrating empathy, and suspending judgment so that the student can be fully heard.
In the table below, explain each component of authentic listening.

#### Practice

Use the following student check-in template as you practice authentic listening to build trust and rapport with your partner.


| Student Surveys | Student surveys (specifically student perception surveys) can be used to help teachers plan instruction because they give teachers direct feedback from students, which can help teachers know how students are feeling about the content they are learning and how comfortable they are with the content. Also, student surveys can give teachers a look into students’ lives beyond the classroom when using an informal kind of survey (e.g., teachers might use a survey at the beginning of the year just to get to know students to learn their likes/dislikes). |

| Non-Academic Conversations | Non-academic conversations give teachers information about students’ lives outside of the classroom. The information teachers gain from these conversations allow them to plan effective instruction because they can then make connections to students’ lives and interests with the content they are teaching, thus increasing engagement and interest in the content presented. |
| Family Relationships | Family relationships provide crucial insight for teachers about students. The information teachers gain from building strong, positive relationships with students and their families gives a deeper, more holistic look at who the student is. For example, families may be able to provide insight about why a student dislikes math so much (maybe they had a bad experience with a teacher the year before) or why a student is falling asleep in class (maybe they have been caring for a younger sibling in the evenings while a parent works). This information helps teachers plan effective instruction because they can ultimately meet the student where they are, meaning that if a student dislikes math, then the teacher can find ways to use student interests to connect to math concepts or find additional time for students to complete assignments if they are falling asleep in class after watching their younger sibling. |


| Authentic Listening Component | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Give Full Attention | Limiting distractions, like putting away cell phones or closing laptops, show the speaker that you are fully engaged and present in the conversation. Asking genuine, direct follow-up questions also shows the speaker that you care and are invested in the conversation. |
| Demonstrate Empathy | Demonstrating empathy means that you try to understand feelings as well as words. Being kind, compassionate, and empathetic can allow students to feel more at ease. |
| Suspend Judgment | Suspending judgment is important so that students do not feel like their words or emotions are being judged or thought of as “less than.” Listen with an open mind to students’ concerns. |
| Accept Natural Student Expression | Let students express themselves in their own way. There is no need to correct grammar when listening to students to build trust and rapport. Allowing students to come to you as their authentic selves can improve rapport and build deeper trust. |
| Empathy Sentence Starters | It sounds to me like this might feel…. I can sense that you are feeling… I can hear how [emotion] you are feeling. Your face is telling me that… I can hear in your voice that… |
| Affirming Statements | Thank you for sharing this with me. I understand you feel that way. That sounds like a(n) [adjective] experience. I hear you. I am not sure what to say right now, but I am here to listen. |
