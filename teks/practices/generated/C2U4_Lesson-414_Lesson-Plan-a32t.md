| 5 mins | Bellringer You have asked two friends to review the poem that you have just written for your English class.  Below is the feedback that you received from each: Friend 1:  The imagery in your work is very strong.  I was able to see the environment that you described and felt like I was there, and it pulled me in as a reader. Friend 2: I really liked your poem.  Great job! After considering the feedback, which of the two do you feel is most helpful? What makes the feedback more helpful than the other? | Student Guide |
|  | T: Let’s take a poll. How many of you thought Friend 1 was most helpful? S: (Raise their hands to respond.) T: How many of you thought Friend 2 was most helpful?  S: (Raise their hand to respond.) T: If you chose Friend 1 what was your thinking? S: The feedback from Friend 1 was specific about the strengths of the poem. T: The feedback that you received from friend number 1 was likely more helpful because it was specific about the strengths of the poem.  While it is always nice to feel supported with positive words like “great job,” that isn’t always helpful because we don’t know what makes the work great. T: In our lesson today, we will spend some more time discussing feedback and some of the key characteristics of quality feedback. |  |
| 5 mins | Return to the Memory Model T: (Display the ppt referencing the simple memory model.) Yesterday we discussed the importance of practice in learning.  Why is practice important for learning? S: Practice helps us to move information from the working memory to the long-term memory.  Once in the long-term memory, recalling the information often with practice can move it back to working memory so that the learner can further refine and strengthen that learning.   T:  While most learning requires practice, not all practice is the same.  We talked about how practice should be deliberate.  What are the characteristics of deliberate practice?  S: Practice that is authentic, spaced out over time, low stakes and paired with feedback.   T: Today we will focus on how we can provide quality feedback to support deliberate practice. | PPT Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes-Quality Feedback T: (Display PPT and direct students to their student guide for notes.) T: We discussed that feedback was the practice was a key part of deliberate practice.  How did we define feedback? S: Giving students information about their performance against a standard with the purpose of improving student performance. T: As we saw with the example of feedback in the bellringer exercise, not all feedback is created equal.  It is important to provide quality feedback to students during practice if we want the practice to improve learning. T: Quality feedback has four characteristics that help to improve student learning.   Specific and clear:  The feedback provides specific information about the strengths and areas where the work can be improved.  You will remember that the feedback from friend 1 in the bellringer example clearly identified the strength of the poem to be the imagery and described how the imagery impacted the reader.   Focused on the task rather than the student:  A key piece of quality feedback is that is references standards versus referencing the student.  Feedback such as “I noticed you only had 3 supporting details.  The assignment asks for 5 supporting details” provides key information to the student about how they can strengthen their work.  Providing feedback such as “Your writing is not detailed enough” implies a personal criticism rather than focusing on the expectations of the task. Identifies key strengths as well as areas for improvement:  While it is important to know the areas growth and improvement, it is also important to recognize what is done well so that can be replicated in future work. The feedback is provided in a timely manner.  If feedback isn’t timely students do not have the opportunity to refine or revise their thinking before moving on. T: Let’s look at an example in your student guide. | PPT Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Summary Paragraphs (adapted from https://acole1.wordpress.com/category/p3/) T: A grade three ELA teacher asked her students to write a summary paragraph for the text that they just read about octopi.  Below are the success criteria for the practice: Paragraph Structure:  The paragraph must have 5 or more complete sentences, using capitalization and punctuation. Supporting Details:  The paragraph must have 3 or more supporting details from the text. Main Idea:  The main idea of the text must be included in the summary. T:  Look at the feedback provided to student 3. Is this quality feedback? Why or why not?  S: Yes. It is specific and clear identifying how the student can improve the work.  It focuses on the task by referencing the pre-established success criteria.  It identifies areas of strength (great details) as well as areas of improvement (need 1 more sentence).  T: Now look at the work of student 1 on your student guide.  What quality feedback could you provide to student 1 to help them improve their work? S: I only see three sentences here and our summaries need to have at least 5.  Great main ideas and details!  Practice 2: Non-Example of Feedback  T: Now let’s take a look at a non-example of quality feedback provided on student work.  Please locate Practice 2 on your student guide.  T:  Read through the practice 2 description and look at the piece of student work and feedback provided.  S: (Students read practice 2)  T: Why is the feedback provided on the student work example in practice 2 NOT considered quality feedback?  S: The feedback is not specific. It mentions “Watch your Capitalizations” but doesn’t identify where that is a problem.  Also, there are random words circled and it is unclear to the student why they were circled.  There is some positive feedback like “Yes” or “Good Detail” but the student doesn’t know why the yes was put there or what made that a good detail to include. Also, saying “You are a great artist” refers more to the student than the task.  T: How might you use the characteristics of quality feedback to revise the feedback on this student work?  S: I would clarify why the words are circled with a specific comment about how to change them (Throwed to threw, selled to sold).  More clarity around the “Yes” comment, such as “Great job identifying the participants” and “good detail” could be enhanced by “This detail is specific and tells what happened”.  The comment “You are a great artist” could be changed to say “Your picture is great.  It helps to explain the summary better.”  T: Yes, it is important for feedback to identify both strengths and areas for improvement, but both need to be specific.   And, all feedback should focus on the task rather than on the student. | Student Guide |
| 17 mins | Practice 2-Cookie Dough Math (12 mins) (adapted from https://www.achieve.org/files/sites/default/files/NYCDOEG3MathCookieDough_Student%20Work.pdf) T: Now you will practice giving quality feedback to a math student on a piece of sample work. Read through the success criteria for Cookie Dough Math. S: (Read the success criteria.) T: Independently examine the student work and write quality feedback to the student aligned with the success criteria. (Provide 5 minutes for students to complete.) S: (Complete Practice 2.) T: Now you will take turns sharing the feedback you wrote in small groups. (Arrange students into groups of 3.) As one student presents, the other two students should listen and record the feedback that the group member provides on the chart in your student guide.  You will have 7 minutes to discuss your feedback as a group and identify if the feedback provided by each group member meets the criteria for quality feedback.  S: (Students complete practice and record work on the student guide.) | Student Guide |
|  | Debrief (5 mins) T: As you worked to provide feedback on student work today, were there characteristics of quality feedback that were easier to meet than others?  Which characteristics were the easiest? Which were the most difficult?  S: (Provide a variety of answers.) Easiest to provide specific feedback when the success criteria was available. Easier to provide the positive feedback; tougher to provide feedback for improvement. Making sure the feedback was clear could be difficult at times. Harder to provide feedback when less familiar with the content. Tough to know how much feedback is enough? Too much? |  |
