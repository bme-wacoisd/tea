| Rationale/ Summary | Students must experience learning in multiple ways to engage the working memory to make meaning of and connections between the ideas and concepts. This helps move the learning from the short-term to the long-term memory. In this lesson, students will learn strategies to provide options for comprehension, the last guideline for multiple means of representation. With teacher support, students will analyze a lesson to evaluate its use of multiple means of representation and determine how the use of those strategies deepen student understanding. Students will then analyze another lesson to plan additional ways to incorporate multiple means of representation. | Students must experience learning in multiple ways to engage the working memory to make meaning of and connections between the ideas and concepts.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | What are the three guidelines for representation? How does each guideline provide access to rigorous content for all students? Read the scenario below and respond to the prompts.  Mr. M is about to teach his students about the life cycle of a frog. First, Mr. M shows an image of a frog on the screen. Then, he tells students that they are going to be learning about life cycles by learning about frogs. Next, Mr. M reads a nonfiction book about the life cycle of a frog. As he reads, he pauses to show images of each of the steps in the life cycle and uses his life cycle wheel to show students where they are in the life cycle.    How does Mr. M incorporate options for comprehension?   What else could Mr. M add to incorporate additional options for comprehension to provide access to rigorous content for all students? See Exit Ticket – Answer Key for exemplar response. | What are the three guidelines for representation? How does each guideline provide access to rigorous content for all students?

| 4 mins | Bellringer:  A fourth-grade math teacher is introducing the concept of adding fractions with a common denominator. He wants to use multiple means of representation in his lesson to ensure all students can access the content.  What are some ways the teacher could incorporate multiple means of representation through options for perception and options for language and symbols into the lesson? | Student Guide |
| 1 min | T: What were some of the ways you suggested for this teacher to incorporate multiple means of representation through options for perception?  S: The teacher could show a video or music video to help students review the concept of fractions with a common denominator. The teacher could use visuals and tactile objects to model how to add fractions with a common denominator.   T: And what about ways the teacher could incorporate multiple means of representation through options for language and symbols?  S: The teacher could pre-teach vocabulary – like common denominator – before the lesson. He might also reference “common denominator” in a student’s heritage language. He might pre-teach or explicitly review mathematical symbols used in the process.  T: Yes, those are all ways the teacher can make the lesson accessible to all learners. |  |
| 10 mins | Notes – Comprehension  T: Today, we are going to learn about the last guideline for providing multiple means of representation.    T: The last guideline is options for comprehension. This means that a teacher provides scaffolds and activities that cognitively engage students in different ways to help develop their ability to construct meaning and generate new understandings.   T: I’m going to show you a video clip. Review the video viewing questions in your student guide. After the clip, I will give you a few minutes to respond before we discuss.  S: (Find and review video viewing questions.)  T: (Begin video clip at 0:15 and end at 1:22.)  S: (Respond to questions in student guide.)  T: What are the two paths to learning according to the video?  S: Rehearsing and relating T: What is the difference between the two paths to learning?  S: Rehearsing is about repeating information over and over again until the brain decides it is important to remember. Relating is about making connections between prior learning and new learning.  T: Why is one path to learning more effective than the other?  S: Relating helps learners sort and organize information into schema. T: That’s right. And when we can organize new information into existing schema, we can attach it to things we already understand, giving it more meaning. When we relate information to other information, we are able to learn it more deeply. T: Now I’m going to continue the video so we can see what this guideline might look like in the classroom. As you watch, record notes on the different strategies for comprehension in the graphic organizer in your student guide. (Share video. Pause after each guideline to allow students to record notes in student guide, to provide additional examples, and to provide nonexamples.)   T: We learned about activating prior knowledge in our Science of Learning unit. What do you remember about why activating prior knowledge is important? S: It helps students make connections to new information, better understand new information, and store and retrieve new information.  T: Yes, starting with what students already know will help them comprehend new information. What are some strategies you remember for activating prior knowledge?  S: KWL charts, concept maps, anticipation guide, and self-assessments.  T: Yes, these are all ways that a teacher can activate prior knowledge. Teachers can also make cross-curricular connections to help students activate prior knowledge. If they learned something in math that they see again in science, helping them make the connection between the two contents will support better learning.  T: You learned about examples and non-examples in the Science of Learning unit. Another way to highlight the most important ideas about a topic is to use graphic organizers. Graphic organizers are visual tools that help students organize information. Where have you seen graphic organizers before?  S: In our student guides.  T: That’s right. Many of your student guides include graphic organizers that help you to organize information from a lesson.  T: Annotations are another way to help students focus on and process content in a text or graphic. Annotations are brief notes or comments added by the reader to a text or graphic to record thinking at a specific moment in the text.  T: Breaking information into smaller elements is another strategy we learned about in the Science of Learning. Why is it important to break information into small pieces?  S: To help students avoid cognitive overload.  T: Yes, and giving explicit prompts is one way of breaking something down into smaller parts. Adapted from CAST (2018). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.2. Retrieved from http://udlguidelines.cast.org  T: Transfer and generalization are important elements of learning. Transfer and generalization are the abilities to understand that learning does not apply only to one context or situation and the ability to apply learning to a new context.  T: Based on what you already know, why is it important to provide multiple opportunities for review and practice?  S: Multiple opportunities for review and practice help move information from short term memory to long-term memory.  T: Yes, and how do you think that might help a student transfer learning to a new context?  S: When information is in long-term memory, a student can retrieve it when it seems important.  T: Yes, information in long-term memory can be retrieved when a new context comes up. Providing opportunities to apply learning to new situations helps a learner sees the types of situations in which that information might be useful. T: Does anyone know what a mnemonic device is?  S: (Answer will vary.) T: A mnemonic device is a memory aid that improves a person’s ability to remember something through patterns of letters, numbers, or associations. Has anyone learned anything through the use of mnemonic devices?  S: (Answers will vary but may include ROY G. BIV, “I before E except after C or in sounding like A as in neighbor and weigh,” “Please excuse my dear aunt Sally.”) T: (Provide examples if students don’t provide any.) | Student Guide PPT UDLA Representation Comprehension Video |
| 8 mins | T: Let’s look at a few visual representations of these different strategies. As you look at the examples, think about how each example relates to opportunities for comprehension and take notes in your student guide. (Use the PPT to show examples.) S: (Take notes about each example in the student guide.) T: How does a KWL chart support comprehension?  S: It is a graphic organizer that helps students access prior knowledge, so it aligns to the guideline for activating prior knowledge.  T: Right. And what about concept maps?  S: They can be used to organize prior knowledge and they can also help students to make connections between new ideas. Concept maps are an example of a way students can show relationships and connections between big ideas.  T: What about annotating texts? What do you notice about this Mark up the Text activity that aligns with options for comprehension?  S: The strategy gives students a way to identify key details and make connections between ideas. It also can help them consider and monitor their prior knowledge through a focus on new vocabulary, questions, and predictions.  T: How does the multiplying fractions poster support comprehension?  S: It breaks information into smaller pieces and provides students with a frame for a step-by-step process. It aligns to the information processing and visualization guideline.  T: The last example we will look at is graphic organizers. What are some graphic organizers you have used?  S: (Answers will vary but may include Venn diagrams, Frayer Model, columned charts, flow charts, etc.) T: How do graphic organizers help comprehension?  S: They help students organize information by providing a visual representation of key ideas and patterns.  T: Technology is also a great tool to support multiple means of representation. Many of the strategies you just explored can be accessed in a digital format, such as a digital graphic organizer or annotating features and apps.  T: How else might you use technology to support multiple means of representation?   S: Students could explore videos and websites to learn more about the concept or play instructional games to build understanding of skills. T: How do these strategies support multiple means of representation and the retention of new information? S: These strategies help students cognitively engage through activating prior knowledge, using graphic organizers, and explicitly modeling and scaffolding steps in a process.  This helps students make-meaning and deepen their understanding of key concepts. | Student Guide PPT |
| 15 mins | Practice – Activity Analysis  T: We are going to look at a couple of classroom activities to determine how the plan supports options for comprehension and how we might incorporate additional options for comprehension. We will do the first one together and you will do the second one with a partner.  T: Find the practice activity in your student guide. Take a couple of minutes to read the activity. As you read, underline elements of the plan that address options for comprehension. Put a star anywhere you think the teacher might add an option for comprehension. I’m going to give you 4 minutes to read, think, and annotate your scenario. (Set a timer for 4 minutes.)  S: (Read and annotate their scenarios.)  T: Let’s review the scenario together. Who underlined an element of the scenario that supported comprehension?   S: (Raise hands to share answers.)  T: What did you underline?   S: (Answers will vary but should include elements underlined in the student guide answer key.) | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: Let’s think about today’s lesson. How did I engage multiple options for comprehension?   S: The bellringer activated our prior knowledge about the first two elements of Multiple Means of Representation. We had graphic organizers to take notes about the options for comprehension and to take notes on the examples. We also used annotation and graphic organizers to complete the practice lesson analysis activity.   T: How did the graphic organizers help you as learners?   S: They helped us to organize information and consider the relationships between key elements.   T: And how did the annotations help you?   S: They focused our reading and helped us to remember the task and apply the new information to the scenarios. | Student Guide |
