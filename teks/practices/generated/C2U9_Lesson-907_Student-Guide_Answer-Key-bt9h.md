Bellringer:
Below are some examples of sentence starters that could be used to support peer feedback.  How can utilizing the sentence starters help students to provide effective feedback?
- The best part of your work is…because…
- To make your work stronger I would suggest….
- I am wondering…
They help to structure the feedback for a student, both to get started but also to promote specific and clear feedback.
Peer Feedback Strategies
Peer Feedback: Practice where feedback is given by one student to another.
Considerations for selection of strategy:
Age group of the students
Amount of time required to provide effective feedback.
Type of feedback (small part of work vs whole work)
How much feedback (Feedback from many students or just one/two)
At what stage of the work is the strategy best utilized? (before draft is completed, after a completed draft)
Scaffolds to support effective feedback.
Model: Assessing a Peer Feedback Strategy



Practice: Teaching Peer Feedback Strategies
Strategy 1

Strategy 2

Strategy 3

Scenario 1: Mr. Olivera’s 2nd Grade Opinion Writing
Which of the peer feedback strategies that we have discussed would be most appropriate to use in this situation? (Gallery Walk, 2 Stars and a Wish, Charette Protocol)
2 Stars and a Wish
Which of the key considerations impacted your decision to select this strategy and why?
Younger elementary students, limited amount of time (30 min or less), only wants feedback from a few peers, whole piece of work to evaluate.

Scenario 2: Mrs. Greaves 8th Grade Social Studies Colonial Newspaper
Which of the peer feedback strategies that we have discussed would be most appropriate to use in this situation? (Gallery Walk, 2 Stars and a Wish, Charette Protocol)
Gallery Walk
Which of the key considerations impacted your decision to select this strategy and why?
Students are middle school; they have completed a draft and the teacher wants lots of feedback on a whole piece of work.  She only has about 30 minutes to dedicate to the feedback process.

Scenario 3: Mr. Johannsson’s High School Art II Project
Which of the peer feedback strategies that we have discussed would be most appropriate to use in this situation? (Gallery Walk, 2 Stars and a Wish, Charette Protocol)
Charette Protocol
Which of the key considerations impacted your decision to select this strategy and why?
High school level students, work in progress, only need feedback from a few peers.



| Strategy: TAG | Description of Best Use |
| --- | --- |
| Age Group of Students | Appropriate for all age groups of students |
| Amount of Time Required | Short time required (10-15 minutes) |
| Type of Feedback | Best for small piece of work, could be altered for larger works |
| How Much Feedback | Best for feedback from a few students |
| Stage of Work | After completed draft |
| Scaffolds to Support Effective Feedback | Sentence starters, handout with TAG categories |


| Strategy: Gallery Walk | Description of Best Use |
| --- | --- |
| Age Group of Students | Best for upper elementary and above due to the level of structure |
| Amount of Time Required | Depends on number of stations, but relatively short time required |
| Type of Feedback (Small piece vs whole work) | Whole work |
| How Much Feedback (Few students vs many students) | Provides an opportunity for all students to provide feedback on all pieces of work |
| Stage of Work (Prior to completing draft vs after completed draft) | After completion of draft |
| Scaffolds to Support Effective Feedback | Sentence starters to guide feedback, review of success criteria, review of how to give effective feedback |


| Strategy: Charette Protocol | Description of Best Use |
| --- | --- |
| Age Group of Students | Middle and High School |
| Amount of Time Required | 15 minutes per round, groups of 4 would require at least an hour |
| Type of Feedback (Small piece vs whole work) | Whole piece: focus question helps to guide the feedback |
| How Much Feedback (Few students vs many students) | Few students serve as feedback partners in the protocol |
| Stage of Work (Prior to completing draft vs after completed draft) | Prior to completing a draft |
| Scaffolds to Support Effective Feedback | Model the process, Sentence starters to help provide feedback, focus question, review of effective feedback |


| Strategy: Two Stars and a Wish | Description of Best Use |
| --- | --- |
| Age Group of Students | All levels, younger students may need more scaffolds |
| Amount of Time Required | Small amount of time (20-30 minutes) |
| Type of Feedback (Small piece vs whole work) | Could be small or whole piece of work |
| How Much Feedback (Few students vs many students) | Few students work in small groups |
| Stage of Work (Prior to completing draft vs after completed draft) | After completion of draft |
| Scaffolds to Support Effective Feedback | Model the process before allowing students to do it, sentence starters, review of success criteria, review of effective feedback, handouts to keep students on track |
