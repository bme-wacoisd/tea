### Lesson 10.03: The Qualities of Effective Schools | What Makes and Effective School?

Name:
Date:
- Name the five levers of an effective school.

- Strong School Leadership and Planning
- Strategic Staffing
- Positive School Culture
- High-Quality Instructional Materials and Assessments
- Effective Instruction

- Examine teacher and student responses on this year’s Effective Schools Framework Survey. School leaders use this survey to identify areas of growth on the framework. Based on the responses to the survey, which levers should the principal prioritize in the next school year? How do you know?

- The principal should prioritize Strong Leadership because most students say they never see leaders in the hallways. They should also focus on High-Quality Instructional Materials, because half of the student body reports that they don’t find lesson materials to be engaging.
