| 5 mins | Bellringer: What is a classroom management plan? Why do teachers need a classroom management plan? | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Partner Discussion:  T: Today you are going to have the opportunity to create your own classroom management plan. Before we do that, I want to show you an example of a completed classroom management plan. We will focus on different components to classroom management, like physical space, behavior management, and the development of routines.  T: Turn to your partner and find the Classroom Management Plan Exemplar. In looking at this exemplar, what do you observe? Take three minutes to discuss as partners and then we will come together as a whole group.  T: (Start a timer for three minutes)  T: What did you and your partner observe about the Classroom Management Exemplar?  S: Answers will vary, but could include: the clear, concise nature of the classroom rules how the plan outlines the way the teacher will manage/organize student work that there are routines to start and end class that the classroom layout seems to facilitate learning in different ways (e.g., group work, accessible classroom library, comfortable reading area, etc.)  T: Why do teachers need a classroom management plan?  T: (Elicit student responses and guide the ensuing discussion to lead students to the conclusion that an effective classroom management plan encompasses all aspects of classroom management, including strategies for the development of positive relationships, proactive and responsive techniques for behavior management and intervention, physical classroom design, and classroom rules, systems, and procedures.)  T: Ultimately, a successful classroom management plan permits the cultivation and sustention of an effective learning environment. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Intro to Classroom Management Plan Template and Rubric T: You are going to spend time today creating your own Classroom Management Plan. In your Student Guide, locate the Classroom Management Plan Template and the rubric.  T: You will use the template to address all components of effective classroom management, which includes the following sections: Classroom Rules, emphasizing: Simplicity Clarity Positive Framing Student Ownership Classroom Procedures, including: Morning/Beginning of Class Routines Routines for Managing Work Dismissal/End of Class Routines Classroom Layout, accounting for: Smooth Transitions Whole Group Discussion Small Group Work Access to Materials Behavior Management & Intervention, including: Preventative Strategies Reactive Techniques Reward Systems Positive Relationship Development, including: Trust and Rapport Boundaries Demeanor Consistency High Expectations Strong Voice Formal Register  T: The rubric is organized in the same way, focusing on the five categories we just discussed. (Go over the rubric and success criteria for each category.) This plan should ultimately be a useful resource to you as a teacher and should clearly lay out strategies, scripts, and systems so that you would be able to use it in a classroom. | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Practice: Develop a Classroom Management Plan T: Now, you will begin to develop a Classroom Management Plan specific to grade level and content area using the template. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: We will continue working on our plans tomorrow. What challenges did you encounter when trying to create your Classroom Management plan?  S: (Share out challenges, answers will vary.)  T: What did you find beneficial about using this type of template to create your classroom management plan?  S: Using the template ensures we are able to address all of the Classroom Management components we have talked about in class. |  |
