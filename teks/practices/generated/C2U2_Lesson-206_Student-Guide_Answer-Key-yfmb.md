Responses will vary

Intro to Positive Framing
As you watch, “Frame Redirections Positively: Hilary Lewis”, consider the following: How does Hilary maintain students’ privacy and communicate her belief that students want to be successful, even as she delivers a redirection?
Hilary’s redirection avoids naming names--"If you have a shape in your hand and it's causing a distraction for you right now, please put it down." She uses a simple if/then statement to communicate what she expects without identifying individual students. She communicates her trust in her students when she frames the shapes as “a distraction.” Students aren’t lacking respect or exhibiting a lack of interest in learning--they just need to put their shapes down so that they’re better able to focus. It’s worth noting that Hilary’s tone and volume communicate her calmness - From Texas TLAC Online.

Notes on Six Rules of Positive Framing

List the six rules of Positive Framing

- Live in the Now
- Assume the Best
- Allow Plausible Anonymity
- Narrate the Positive and Build Momentum
- Challenge!
- Talk Expectations and Aspirations






Notes on Assume the Best

List the elements of an effective Assume the Best
- Attributes behavior to positive intent: When students are making a good-faith effort, avoid ascribing ill intention to what could be the result of distraction or genuine misunderstanding
- Is specific about what you want students to do: Hold students accountable for following through by ensuring they know exactly what they should be doing
- Maintains Economy of Language: Use few words
- Maintains Emotional Constancy: It’s best to use a neutral tone and facial expression when delivering redirections of any kind

Practice 1: Study the example and upgrade the nonexample
List “go-to-phrases” for Assume the Best. Discuss as a class how this list aligns with the success criteria for Assume the Best.



Upgrade the nonexample
Look at two statements below that do not meet the success criteria. Work with a partner to identify how the statements do not meet the success criteria and adjust the statements to improve them.


Practice 2: Analyze Assume the Best in action

As you watch “Frame Redirections Positively: Gillian Cartwright,” look for evidence of Gillian’s Economy of Language and Emotional Constancy and consider how Gillian assumed the best intentions. Record your evidence below.

possible response: Gillian says “In just a moment. I appreciate the enthusiasm.” In just a few words she attributes student’s behavior to positive intent, while maintaining positive body language.


Practice 3: Creating effective Assume the Best statements

Plan and deliver an Assume the Best redirection with a partner using the following scenario from Texas TLAC Online. As your partner delivers their Assume the Best statement, use the feedback rubric below to provide specific feedback to your partner on their alignment to the success criteria.


Scenario: Students are solving math problems. You’ve asked them to show their work, but you notice that a few students are skipping right to jotting the solution.

As you plan, make sure your Assume the Best statement:
- Attributes behavior to positive intent
- Tells students exactly what they should do
- Maintains Economy of Language
- Maintains Emotional Constancy


Draft Statement:

Possible response: "Pause. A few of us are forgetting to show our work. Remember: Show your work in addition to writing the solution. Back to it!"
Feedback Rubric



| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Student Excitement | “Some of us are so excited that we’re already jumping in. Before you start, please make sure your desks are totally clear.” |
| Student Forgetting | “Pause. A couple of us forgot to complete planning before drafting. Please compete parts 1 and 2 of the prep sheet first.” |
| Teacher Clarity | “I wasn’t clear enough. First, be sure to jot down your own word or phrase as part of your annotation.” |
| Student Confusion | “It seems like a few of us might be confused. Let me model one more before you go back to independent work.” |


| Statement | Revision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fourth grade, none of us should be trying to sneak ahead of the rest of the class. | possible response: Just a minute, fourth grade. A couple of people were so excited to write about Roald Dahl that they went ahead before I told them to start | possible response: the original statement assume student are trying to look ahead to get an advantage. |
| Tina, please wait to answer until Jeffrey decides to join us. | possible response: A couple of people forgot our rules about tracking, Tina. Give them a second before you start | possible response: the original statement a places blame on a particular student and assumes he is choosing not to track. |


|  | Still Working On It. Provide Suggestions for Improvement. | You got it! Provide Evidence. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attributes behavior to positive intent: When students are making a good-faith effort, avoids ascribing ill intention to what could be the result of distraction or genuine misunderstanding. |  |  |
| Is specific about what you want students to do: Holds students accountable for following through by ensuring they know exactly what they should be doing. |  |  |
| Economy of Language: Use as few words as possible to lead the class through the Do It Again so their focus stays on the content and your Do It Again doesn’t turn into a lecture. |  |  |
| Maintains Emotional Constancy: Use a neutral tone and facial expression when delivering redirections of any kind |  |  |
