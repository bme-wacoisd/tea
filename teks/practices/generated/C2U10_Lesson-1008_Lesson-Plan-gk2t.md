| Rationale/ Summary | Teachers need to continually engage in reflection and improvement practices to refine their approach to instruction—this is important for their growth as a professional as well as student growth and learning. This lesson introduces students to the concept of a Continuous Improvement Cycle where they will identify the strategies teachers use to analyze instruction and ways of improvement. They will also be introduced to Texas Lesson Study, an application of the continuous improvement cycle that Texas teachers use to support their instructional goals through collaboration. | Teachers need to continually engage in reflection and improvement practices to refine their approach to instruction—this is important for their growth as a professional as well as student growth and learning.

|  | For the Texas Lesson Study Deep Dive, there are six topics. Students can be placed into six groups, assigning each group one TXLS step. For smaller classes it is recommended to split them into three groups, assigning each group two TXLS steps. Timing for this lesson is approximate and may require more than one 45-minute class session to complete. Please adjust to your class needs as necessary. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Of the quotes listed below, select one of them that speaks most to you. Why does this quote stand out? Do you agree or disagree with it? How do you think the quote you selected applies to teaching and learning? Quote A: “When you’re in a growth mindset, what that means is that you choose to see struggle and challenge as an opportunity for growth and for learning and development.” -Chris Bertram  Quote B: “It is only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.” -Roy T. Bennett  Quote C: “Practice the philosophy of continuous improvement. Get a little better every single day.” -Author Unknown | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Introduction to the Continuous Improvement Cycle: T: Today we’re going to discuss a concept called continuous improvement. Based on the quotes you read and context clues, what do you think continuous improvement means? S: (Answers will vary.) T: To explain continuous improvement, we are going to describe it as a cycle. The continuous improvement cycle is an intentional approach to improving one’s practice through planning, action, and reflection. Being aware of the areas in which you can grow as a teacher and intentionally using strategies to promote that growth will help you to become a better teacher and give more opportunities for your students to learn. T: Find the section of your Student Guide titled “Plan, Do, Study, Act.” These four steps are an easy way to think about how a teacher might implement a continuous improvement cycle. The first step to beginning a continuous improvement process is to identify a problem that should be addressed. This might be a learning goal, a behavior management goal, or a professional development goal. T: When a teacher recognizes their problem of practice, they can implement the PDSA cycle. Step One in the cycle is Plan. Will a volunteer read from the PowerPoint how to implement the planning step? S: Identify the problem, List possible steps to approach the problem. List desired outcomes.  T: The planning process is very important because it determines what steps the teacher will need to take to address the issue.   T: The next step in the cycle is Do. Will a volunteer read from the PowerPoint how to implement this step?  S: Apply the steps listed in the plan, Take notes/make observations during this time.  T: In this step, the teacher will take action to implement the changes they selected during the planning step. During this time, the teacher should be engaged with students and can take notes but should reserve judgements on the effect of the changes until they are able to review data.  T: The third step is Study. Will a volunteer read from the PowerPoint how to implement this step?  S: Study the results after applying the plan. Did you see the outcome you expected? What were the actual results when compared to the desired ones?   T: In this step, the teacher takes time to reflect on how the change they made impacted their overall goal.   T: The final step is Act. Will a volunteer read from the PowerPoint how to implement this step?  S: Consider your next steps. Has the solution addressed the problem? Do you need to return to any of the previous step?  T: In this final step, the teacher determines if they need to make additional changes, or if what they have implemented seems to be working. If the decision is to continue implementing the change or to try something new, they would start the continuous improvement cycle over again with the first step (Plan).  T: Let’s practice looking at an example of when a continuous improvement cycle might be used. Locate the Class Example in your study guide. Independently, take three minutes to read through the scenario and fill out the PDSA graphic organizer.  S: (Independently fill out PDSA graphic organizer.)  T: Let’s review our answers for how Ms. K can implement the PDSA cycle to improve student understanding.   T: (Call on students to share their thoughts on how the teacher can implement PDSA, using the Student Guide Answer Key to confirm exemplar responses.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 3 mins | Introduction to Texas Lesson Study: T: Some teachers in Texas participate in Lesson Study. Lesson Study is a type of professional development that was developed over 100 years ago in Japan. It’s a way for teachers to work together to improve their practice. Let’s watch a quick video explaining how Texas Lesson Study works.  T: (Show introduction video on Lesson Study Webpage.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 15 mins | Texas Lesson Study Deep Dive:  T: You are going to work in groups to learn more about Texas Lesson Study as an example of a Continuous Improvement Cycle. T: (Move students into groups and assign them 1-2 topics. See the teacher notes at the beginning of the lesson.) T: You will have fifteen minutes to learn as much as you can about your step(s). Use the graphic organizer to record your information and then, as a group, create a poster to explain your step(s) to your classmates. S: (Begin researching TXLS and creating posters.) T: (Circulate the room and help students when needed.) | Student Guide Internet Connected Device per Group Poster Paper Markers |
| 5 mins | Texas Lesson Study Group Share Out: T: (Starting with Step 0, instruct groups to share out about the steps of TXLS.) S: (Starting with Step 0, groups will share the steps of TXLS.) | Student Guide Poster Paper |
| 2 mins | Debrief:   T: Why should teachers participate in continuous improvement cycles, such as TXLS or PDSA? S: These cycles allow them to better understand what is and is not working to promote student learning, and in some cases allows for collaboration with other teachers who are experiencing a similar problem or question. | Student Guide |
