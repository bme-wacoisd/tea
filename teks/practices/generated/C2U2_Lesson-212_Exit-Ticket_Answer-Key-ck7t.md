Date:
On the PowerPoint displayed, there is a picture of a third-grade classroom. Identify what elements of the classroom design help make it a safe and effective learning environment (Consider furniture, materials, and spaces for activities)? Is there anything you would add or take away from the space?
Answer:  The desks are placed in small groups and there is enough space for the teacher and students to easily move throughout the room. The teacher’s desk is positioned so that they can view all of the students. Materials are organized and accessible to the students. There are spaces created for different activities like the small group table and the classroom library. There is good lighting and an appropriate academic print on the walls.
