While you likely created the artifacts included in your portfolio before finalizing your philosophy of education, you will see elements of your philosophy reflected in what you have produced. Who wants to share an example of something they included in their portfolio that reflects their philosophy of education?   S: (Responses will vary)  T: With your portfolio complete, each of you will have an opportunity to share all that you have learned throughout this course with your peers and invited guests.
