| Rationale/ Summary | Teachers need to see what’s happening in their classrooms. In this lesson, students will learn how to set the stage for success by giving observable directions and scanning the room. (Texas TLaC Online)  This is the first of two lessons on Radar: Be Seen Looking. In this lesson, students will learn about Be Seen Looking and different “dance moves” that can be used to communicate the teacher as a careful observer. Students will practice using the various Be Seen Looking “Dance Moves” and analyze the technique used in various classrooms to explain how this technique promotes an effective learning environment and builds positive relationships with students. | Teachers need to see what’s happening in their classrooms.

|  | Prior to beginning this lesson, ensure you can access the following videos:  Be Seen Looking: Doug Lemov and Jabali Sawicki Be Seen Looking: Denarius Frazier Be Seen Looking: Michael Rubino Be Seen Looking: Sadie McCleary |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think of a time when a teacher recognized you for doing the right thing in class. How did your teacher’s response to your efforts impact your motivation and performance? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Intro to Radar – Be Seen Looking  T: Be Seen Looking is a strategy that tells students that you notice them.  T: Teachers intentionally cause students to notice that they are good and careful observers. A simple nod in a student’s direction or a tilt of the head might say, “I see what you are doing. You should put that away now, please.” Let’s watch a video to see this in action.  T: (Show the video “Be Seen Looking: Doug Lemov and Jabali Sawicki.” Direct students to respond to guiding questions on the 2.17 Student Guide.)  T: (Use Volunteers and Conscripts to provide opportunity for students to share their responses. Call on as many students who volunteer to answer as students who do not volunteer to answer.)  T: How can you balance seeing behaviors that meet expectation vs those that do not?   S: Use subtle messages, such as head nods, gestures, etc. to show students that you see them.  T: Why is it important to notice the students who are working hard and meeting expectations for behavior?   S: Students want to know that you see the good they are doing; by reinforcing the good, students will want to keep doing it; builds positive relationships with students, etc.  T: How does it impact the classroom to notice behaviors that do not meet expectations?  S: Students are less likely to misbehave and there is less peer pressure to misbehave because students know the teacher will catch them  T: When should teachers be seen looking?   S: All the time, especially when they are working one-on-one with a student or small group of students; the rest of the class needs to know the teacher is still aware of the whole class. | Student Guide PowerPoint Video: Be Seen Looking: Doug Lemov & Jabali Sawicki |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Be Seen Looking “Dance Moves”  T: We are going to learn a variety of strategies for Be Seen Looking “Dance Moves.” These are moves that ensure students see a teacher looking. Let’s start with invisible column.  T: (Provide the definition of Invisible Column using the PPT and then model for students).  T: Now stand up and everyone try “Invisible Column.”  S: (Students physically stand up and practice Invisible Column as a whole group or in pairs while teacher provides feedback.)  T: (Repeat for each strategy. If using pairs, students can change partners for each practice round. The list of strategies can be found below.)  Invisible Column Tip Toes The Sprinkler Disco Finger The Politician The Quarterback |  |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Analyze Be Seen Looking in Action  T: Let’s see this in action now by looking at a few videos. As you watch each video, note the ways each teacher intentionally scans on the 2.17 Student Guide. Pay close attention to the different Be Seen Looking “Dance Moves”.  T: (Show “Be Seen Looking: Denarius Frazier.” You may need to replay the video more than once.)  S: (Watch video and take notes on student guide.)  T: What Dance Moves did you see Denarius Frazier using? (Use Pair Rehearsal to allow students to confirm their answers with a partner before you begin accepting volunteers to respond.)   S: Swivel, Invisible Column, The Quarterback  T: (Show “Be Seen Looking: Michael Rubino.” You may need to replay the video more than once.)  T: What Dance Moves did you see Michael Rubino using? (Use Pair Rehearsal to allow students to confirm their answers with a partner before you begin accepting volunteers to respond.)   S: Swivel, Pastore’s Perch, moving around the room to scan, The Quarterback  T: (Show “Be Seen Looking: Sadie McCleary.” You may need to replay the video more than once.)  T: What Dance Moves did you see Sadie McCleary using? (Use Pair Rehearsal to allow students to confirm their answers with a partner before you begin accepting volunteers to respond.)   S: Swivel, Invisible Column, Pastore’s Perch, moving around the room to scan. | Student Guide Video: Be Seen Looking: Denarius Frazier Video: Be Seen Looking: Michael Rubino Video: Be Seen Looking: Sadie McCleary |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Why is it important for a teacher to Be Seen Looking?   S: Be Seen Looking can increase motivation and accountability in a classroom. When students know the teacher is going to catch them doing something good, they may be more motivated. When students know the teacher is not going to miss them doing something that is not good, they are less likely to try.   T: How do these “Dance Moves” show students that a teacher is watching?  S: The provide opportunities for eye contact throughout the room, gestures show that a teacher is observing students, movement around the room shows that a teacher isn’t going to miss areas | Student Guide |
