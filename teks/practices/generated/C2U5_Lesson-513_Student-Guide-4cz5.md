Below is an example of a rubric that a 5th grade science teacher is thinking of using to assess her student’s science fair projects. In the assignment, students were asked to design a science experiment, test the experiment, collect, and analyze experiment data and communicate the results via a visual display. How does this align to the characteristics of quality rubrics? What suggestions or feedback could you provide the teacher for improvement of the rubric?

| Mr. Thomas is a science teacher who just finished a unit on alternative energy sources and energy transfer. To assess their knowledge, he created a scenario where the students are asked to work as engineers to design, build and test a solar cell using common materials for a remote community in need of power.  As a part of this activity, students will present their solar cell by sharing their research, design process and justification for materials used. |  |
| Mrs. Rios, a math teacher, just finished a unit on area and perimeter. As a part of the assessment, students were asked to create their own robot where each body part must be a specific perimeter or specific area.
