| TEKS | 7 | The student creates an effective learning environment. The student is expected to: describe and implement a safe and an effective learning environment that incorporates the principles of universal design. demonstrate teacher and trainer characteristics that promote an effective learning environment. identify classroom-management techniques that promote an effective learning environment. | The student creates an effective learning environment.

| Rationale/ Summary | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom. This lesson is the fifth in a series of six focused on the introduction of systems and routines. For systems and routines to work, teachers must get student buy-in. One way to increase student buy-in is to help students own the systems and routines. Careful attention to the roll-out of a routine or system can increase student ownership. In this lesson, students will practice the implementation of a routine roll-out with classmates who were not involved in drafting the routine itself. In this way, they will serve as more authentic “students” during the practice. | Designing effective systems and routines is only a start to developing an efficient, focused, and safe classroom.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Based on the first practice round, what revisions and refinements would you suggest?  What should you and your classmates consider moving forward to improve upon roll-out and deliberate practice in your next rounds? See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Based on the first practice round, what revisions and refinements would you suggest?

|  | In Lessons 1.08, 1.10, and 1.12, students worked in five groups to design classroom routines. In this lesson, students need to be placed into five groups that completely split up the five original groups. Each student should be in a group with four students who were not part of their original design group. |  |
|  | Prepare to share the video Deliberate Practice: Kim Griffith. |  |
|  | Considering the size of your groups, prepare enough copies of the Feedback Rubric in the Student Guide so that every student can complete one rubric for each member of their group. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Over the next two days, you will be working in new groups to practice rolling-out your entire routine, including deliberate practice. Based on the past few days of learning, as well as your reflections on your strengths and opportunities for improvement, what are some reminders to yourself that you’d like to focus on? What is one goal you have for your practice opportunity? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Video and Discussion:  Routine Roll-Out and Practice  T: May I have some volunteers share how they responded to the bellringer?  S: (Responses will vary based on student work to-date in their design groups.)  T: Be sure to keep the ideas from your bellringer in your head as you practice today. We want everyone to work on the goal they listed.  T: When thinking about implementing a new routine with students, it can be helpful to see many ways that teachers complete this task. As we’ve discussed, each teacher has their own style and personality, so multiple examples help show how there are different ways to reach the same goal: a classroom routine that students own and complete almost without thinking.  T: We’re going to begin by giving you the opportunity to see one more example of a routine roll-out, including student practice. As you watch this video with Ms. Griffith, respond to the questions in the Viewing Guide in your Student Guide.  T: (Play video.)  S: (Respond to questions in Viewing Guide in Student Guide.)  T: You’re now going to discuss what you saw with a partner. In addition to sharing your responses to the questions in the Viewing Guide, work with your partner to answer the next question in your Student Guide. This question helps you think about how watching Ms. Griffith’s video might change what you want to accomplish during your practice time today. You will have 8 minutes for your discussion with your partner. Stand Up-Hand Up-Pair Up!  T: (Set 8-minute timer.)  S: (Use routine to identify partner, share responses to questions in Viewing Guide, and respond to next question in Student Guide.)  T: (Circulate to answer questions and provide support as needed). | Student Guide Video: Kim Griffith |
| 15 mins | Small Group Practice: Routine Roll-Out and Practice  T: As you read in the bellringer, you’re going to have the opportunity to practice the routine your group designed with a new group of classmates. Since they did not help you create the routine, it’s new to them, just like it would be to a group of students.  We’ll start by getting into groups.  T: (Assign students into groups and identify a location in the classroom for each group to work.)  S: (Move to location assigned by teacher.)  T: Each member of the group will practice the roll-out of the routine you designed. The student practicing is acting as the teacher, and everyone else is acting as the students. Those who are acting as students should complete a Feedback Rubric. I am going to hand out copies of the rubric so that you will have enough to complete one for each member of your group.  T: (Distribute copies of Feedback Rubric.)  T: Before you begin practicing, think about how many people are in your group. You have 12 minutes for practice. Determine how many minutes each person has to practice and add it to your Student Guide. Begin.  T: (Set 12-minute timer.)  S: (Rotate through practicing their routine and providing feedback to their classmates.)  T: (Circulate to answer questions and provide support as needed.) | Student Guide Copies of Feedback Rubric from Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Debrief T: As we come back together, please make sure that you have all the copies of the rubric that your group members completed while you were practicing your routine.  T: I am going to give you 3 minutes to silently read though the feedback you received. Begin.  T: (Set 3-minute timer.)  S: (Review feedback received from group members.)  T: As you think about the feedback you received, what did you learn?  S: Responses will vary based on feedback.  T: How did it feel to practice the routine as the teacher?  S: Responses will vary based on student practice experience.  T: How did you feel about how your “students” responded to your routine?  S: Responses will vary based on student practice experience. | Student Guide |
