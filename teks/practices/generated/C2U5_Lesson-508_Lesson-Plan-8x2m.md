| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Reflect on your experience in the role play – including your strengths and opportunities for growth. Based on feedback from your peers and your own self-assessment, what did you do well during the role play?  Based on feedback from your peers and your own self-assessment, what are your opportunities for improvement?

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Students are learning about the impact of weather on land changes in their science class. As a part of the unit, the engaged in an experiment to test the strength of each. The objective of this lesson was to compare two rock materials to determine which would be more impacted by weather. Number each question below to show the best overall progression to build understanding. Using the question and anticipated response below, create additional questions to “stretch it.” |  |
| 2 mins | T: Before we review the bellringer, talk with a partner to compare your answers, and come to consensus.   S: (Find partners. Compare and discuss answers.)  T: How easy was it to anticipate student responses?   S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Why is it important for teachers to anticipate student responses?   S: So they can be prepared for stretch it questions. |  |
| 12 mins | Role Play Setup  T: Now that we have reviewed the success criteria, it is time to practice delivering questions and responding to student responses with a role play. Working in groups of 4, you will role play 4 different moments in a lesson based on the same text.   T: The text is divided into chapters. Each student will role play a discussion about one chapter. (Move students into groups of 4 and assign each member of the group a different chapter of the text.)  T: You will notice a graphic organizer on your student guide. The graphic organizer provides anchor questions for each chapter. When you are the teacher, you will begin your role play with one of the anchor questions. Before we begin the roles plays, you will have some time to prepare. Read the text and when you get to your assigned portion, plan a few follow-up questions you might use to stretch responses. To participate as students, you will need to read the entire text, not just your portion. You only need to play questions for your portion. (Provide time for students to read the text and plan questions.)  S: (Read the text and plan additional follow-up questions based on their anchor question.) |  |
| 20 mins | Practice 1: Role Play  T: When you are not the teacher, you will play the students and provide feedback to your teacher using the rubric. You will have four minutes for the role play, and one minute to discuss and provide feedback.  T: Round 1 begins now. (Set timer for 4 minutes.)  S: (Engage in Round 1 of role play.)  T: Now, you have one minute to provide feedback. (Set timer for 1 minute.)  S: (Provide feedback.)  T: (Repeat the process for Rounds 2, 3, and 4.)  S: (Engage in the role play. Provide feedback and discuss between each round.) |  |
| 3 mins | Debrief  T: What was easiest about delivering questions and responding to answers?   S: (Provide responses based on their personal experiences.)  T: What was hardest?   S: (Provide responses based on their personal experiences.)  T: To wrap up our lesson today, you are going to complete a self-reflection about your own role as the teacher. |  |
| 3 mins | S: (Complete the exit ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
