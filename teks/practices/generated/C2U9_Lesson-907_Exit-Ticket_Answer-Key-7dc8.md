Scenario
Students in Mrs. Blanchard’s middle school science class have worked on developing science experiments to investigate density.  The students designed an experiment to determine the density of different objects, conducted the experiment to collect data and then created a poster to present the experiment, data, and findings to their classmates.  The students have just completed their posters and Mrs. Blanchard wants all the students to have a chance to explore and provide feedback on each of the experiment posters.  She has dedicated about twenty minutes of class time to allow for students to provide feedback.
Which of the peer feedback strategies that we have discussed would be most appropriate to use for this application? (TAG, Gallery Walk, Glow and Grows, Charette Protocol)
Gallery Walk
Which of the key considerations impacted your decision to select this strategy and why?
The age of the students is older, so they would be able to handle the structure of the gallery walk.  Mrs. Blanchard wants all students to provide feedback on all projects and only has about 20 minutes of time to do it.  Gallery walks allow students to review each project and provide feedback on everything in that amount of time.
