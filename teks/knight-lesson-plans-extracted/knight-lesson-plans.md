I DO (15 minutes):
1. Say: "When you hear 'assessment,' what comes to mind?" Take responses - likely "tests" 2. Say: "Assessment is much more than tests. It's gathering evidence of student learning to
make instructional decisions." 3. Present "Three Types of Assessment":
 Formative (for learning): During instruction, guides teaching  Examples: Exit tickets, observations, questions, quick checks  Purpose: Adjust instruction in real-time
 Summative (of learning): End of unit, measures mastery  Examples: Tests, projects, presentations, portfolios  Purpose: Evaluate if students met objectives
 Diagnostic: Before teaching, identifies starting point  Examples: Pre-tests, screening tools, inventories  Purpose: Determine what students already know/need
4. Say: "Think of it like GPS navigation. Diagnostic tells you where you're starting. Formative tells you if you're on the right route. Summative tells you if you arrived at the destination."

3. Show example: Display actual 3rd grade TEKS for one subject 4. Anatomy of a TEKS statement:
 Subject and grade level  Strand (big category like "Number and Operations")  Standard number  Student expectation (specific skill/knowledge) 5. Example breakdown:  3.4(A): The student is expected to solve with fluency one-step and two-step
problems involving addition and subtraction within 1,000 using strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and the relationship between addition and subtraction. 6. Say: "This TEKS tells you WHAT to teach (two-step problems up to 1,000) and HOW students should learn it (using strategies like place value)." 7. Present "Why TEKS Matter":  Legal requirement for all Texas public schools  Ensure consistency across the state  Guide curriculum, instruction, and testing  Provide vertical alignment (what comes before/after)  Accountability - schools/teachers evaluated on student mastery of TEKS
YOU DO (15 minutes):
1. Provide TEKS documents for elementary grades (or access online) 2. Say: "Choose a grade level and subject you're interested in teaching." 3. Students explore TEKS and complete "TEKS Scavenger Hunt":
 Find and write 3 TEKS from your chosen grade/subject  For each, identify: What knowledge/skill is required?  Identify one TEKS that seems challenging to teach and explain why  Find a TEKS that connects to another subject area 4. Provide worksheet with these prompts
WE DO (15 minutes):
1. Share discoveries 2. Say: "What TEKS did you find interesting? Challenging?"

3. Discuss: "How do TEKS connect across grades? Let's trace one concept." 4. Example on board: Addition in K, 1st, 2nd, 3rd grade - show progression 5. Say: "This is called vertical alignment. Each grade builds on previous learning." 6. Discuss: "How will you use TEKS in your teaching?" 7. Key points:
 Start with TEKS when planning any lesson  Use TEKS to write objectives  Assess based on TEKS  Track which TEKS you've taught
WORK TIME (30 minutes):
 "TEKS Deep Dive Project" (ongoing this week)  Students select 5 TEKS from their chosen elementary grade/subject  For each TEKS, research and document:
1. What prerequisite knowledge do students need? 2. What comes next (vertical alignment)? 3. What are common student misconceptions? 4. What instructional strategies work well? 5. How could you assess mastery?  Begin research using TEA website, curriculum resources  This becomes a teaching resource for practicum
DAY 27 - Tuesday
Objective: Students will explain the rationale for instructional planning components such as vertical alignment, scope and sequence, and backward design.
TEKS: IP (6)(B,C), Practicum (2)
Teacher Script for Substitute:
"Welcome back! Yesterday we learned about TEKS. Today we learn how to organize them into coherent instruction plans."
I DO (15 minutes):
1. Say: "Imagine building a house without blueprints. That's teaching without a plan. Let me show you how teachers plan strategically."
2. Present "Key Planning Concepts": A. Vertical Alignment:  Ensuring learning builds across grade levels  What students learned before and will learn after  Example: Fractions in 2nd (halves, fourths)  3rd (unit fractions)  4th (equivalent fractions)  5th (operations with fractions)

3. B. Scope and Sequence:  Scope: What will be taught (breadth of content)  Sequence: Order in which it will be taught  Logical progression of concepts  Example: Must teach place value BEFORE teaching addition algorithms
4. C. Backward Design (Understanding by Design):  Start with the END in mind  Step 1: Identify desired results (what should students learn?)  Step 2: Determine acceptable evidence (how will you know they learned it?)  Step 3: Plan learning experiences (what activities will get them there?)
5. Say: "Most new teachers make this mistake: They plan activities first, then try to fit standards. That's backward! Always start with your learning goal."
6. Show example of backward design planning:  Desired Result: Students will compare fractions with like denominators  Evidence: Students correctly order 5 fractions from least to greatest  Learning Experiences: Hands-on fraction manipulatives, visual models, practice problems, games
7. Say: "Notice how the assessment and activities flow naturally from the goal."
YOU DO (15 minutes):
1. Provide case study: "Misaligned Planning" 2. Scenario: "A teacher wants to teach 3rd graders about main idea. She plans fun
activities: making posters, acting out stories, and creating bookmarks. Her assessment is matching vocabulary words to definitions." 3. Students analyze using these questions:
 What's the desired learning outcome?  What's the planned assessment?  Do the activities align with the outcome?  What's wrong with this plan?  How would you fix it using backward design? 4. Students write analysis individually
WE DO (15 minutes):
1. Discuss the case study 2. Say: "What did you identify as problems?" 3. Reveal issues:
 Activities are engaging but don't teach main idea  Assessment measures vocabulary, not main idea  No clear alignment 4. Redesign together using backward design:  Desired Result: Students identify main idea and supporting details  Evidence: Students read passages and correctly state main idea in their own
words

 Activities: Model thinking aloud, guided practice with text, partner practice, independent application
5. Say: "See how everything now connects? That's the power of planning backward."
WORK TIME (30 minutes):
 "Backward Design Practice"  Students create a complete backward design plan:
 Choose one TEKS from their research  Write specific learning objective  Design assessment that truly measures the objective  Plan 3-4 learning activities that build toward the objective  Explain how each component aligns  Provide template following the backward design model  These plans will be developed into full lessons later this unit

YOU DO (15 minutes):
1. Objective writing practice 2. Provide 5 weak objectives (handout) 3. Examples:
 "Students will understand the water cycle"  "Learn about adding two-digit numbers"  "Students will know about George Washington" 4. Say: "Rewrite each objective to make it clear, observable, and measurable." 5. Students work independently improving the objectives
WE DO (15 minutes):
1. Share and critique revised objectives 2. For each original objective, call on students to share their improved version 3. Write several on board 4. Class evaluates: "Is this observable? Measurable? Developmentally appropriate?" 5. Refine together 6. Example transformation:
 Original: "Students will understand the water cycle"  Improved: "Students will diagram and label the four stages of the water cycle
(evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection) with 100% accuracy" 7. Say: "Notice how specific this is? The student knows exactly what's expected."
WORK TIME (30 minutes):
 "Objective Writing for Your TEKS"  Using the 5 TEKS students researched:
 Write 2 learning objectives for each TEKS (10 total objectives)  Objectives should vary in Bloom's levels  Include: audience, behavior, condition, degree  Make sure objectives are developmentally appropriate  Connect objectives to assessments from backward design plan

2. Present "Major Instructional Theories": A. Constructivism:  Students build understanding through experiences  Learning is active, not passive  Connect new info to prior knowledge  Teachers are facilitators, not just lecturers  Example: Science experiment where students discover concepts vs. being told
3. B. Active Learning:  Students engage with material through activities  More effective than passive listening  Methods: discussions, problem-solving, projects, hands-on  Example: Math manipulatives vs. worksheets only
4. C. Direct Instruction:  Teacher-led, structured approach  Explicit teaching of skills/knowledge  Used when efficiency matters  Example: Teaching phonics rules systematically
5. D. Inquiry-Based Learning:  Students ask questions and investigate  Develop critical thinking

 Teacher guides discovery  Example: "What do plants need to grow?" - students design experiments 6. Say: "Notice these aren't mutually exclusive. Good teachers use ALL of these depending on the situation." 7.

WE DO (15 minutes):
1. Discuss matches as a class 2. Say: "Let's compare our thinking. Scenario 1: Teaching alphabet. What did you choose?" 3. Allow respectful debate when students disagree 4. Highlight: "Many scenarios could use multiple approaches. The key is intentional choice
based on your objective and students." 5. Practice combining approaches: "How could you use both direct instruction AND
constructivism to teach addition?" 6. Example: Direct teach algorithm, then use manipulatives for conceptual understanding
WORK TIME (30 minutes):
 "Theory in Action" lesson revision  Students take their lesson plan (from last week):
 Identify which instructional theories are embedded  Revise at least one section to incorporate a different theory  Write rationale explaining why you chose each approach  Consider: Does your lesson have enough active learning? Enough direct
instruction?  Peer consultation: Partner with someone to discuss instructional choices

I DO (15 minutes):

1. Say: "When you hear 'assessment,' what comes to mind?" Take responses - likely "tests" 2. Say: "Assessment is much more than tests. It's gathering evidence of student learning to
make instructional decisions." 3. Present "Three Types of Assessment":
 Formative (for learning): During instruction, guides teaching  Examples: Exit tickets, observations, questions, quick checks  Purpose: Adjust instruction in real-time
 Summative (of learning): End of unit, measures mastery  Examples: Tests, projects, presentations, portfolios  Purpose: Evaluate if students met objectives
 Diagnostic: Before teaching, identifies starting point  Examples: Pre-tests, screening tools, inventories  Purpose: Determine what students already know/need
4. Say: "Think of it like GPS navigation. Diagnostic tells you where you're starting. Formative tells you if you're on the right route. Summative tells you if you arrived at the destination."

13)(B), Practicum (3)
Teacher Script for Substitute:
"Welcome! Today we focus on reflection - the most important professional practice."
I DO (15 minutes):
1. Say: "Reflection turns experience into learning. Without reflection, you just keep repeating the same experiences without growth."
2. Present "The Reflection Cycle" (Kolb's Experiential Learning):  Experience: What happened  Reflect: Think about what happened  Conceptualize: Draw conclusions  Apply: Use insights in future practice

3. Say: "Great teachers reflect constantly: What worked? What didn't? Why? What will I do differently?"
4. Present "Reflection Prompts for Teachers":  Student learning: What evidence shows students learned? Who struggled? Who excelled?  Instruction: What teaching strategies worked? What would I change?  Management: How was student engagement and behavior? What affected this?  Personal growth: What did I learn about teaching? About myself?  Next steps: What are my goals for next time?
5. Show example of strong reflection (provide handout) 6. Contrast with weak reflection:
 Weak: "The lesson went fine. Students seemed to understand."  Strong: "12 of 18 students correctly solved at least 4 of 5 problems, showing
understanding of the multiplication strategy. However, 6 students struggled with word problems, suggesting they need more support with reading comprehension in math contexts. Next time, I'll pre-teach key vocabulary and model thinking aloud while solving word problems." 7. Say: "Notice the difference? Strong reflection is specific and evidence-based."
YOU DO (15 minutes):
1. Structured reflection activity 2. Say: "Think about a recent practicum experience. It could be a lesson you taught, an
observation, or an interaction with students." 3. Provide "Reflection Template":
 Describe the experience (what happened)  Analyze the experience (why did it happen that way)  Evaluate (what worked, what didn't)  Insights gained (what did you learn)  Application (how will this change your future practice) 4. Students write detailed reflection following template 5. Allow 12-15 minutes of focused writing time

DAY 26 - Monday

Objective: Students will explain the role of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) in planning and evaluating instruction.
TEKS: IP (6)(A), Practicum (2)
Teacher Script for Substitute:
"Good morning and welcome to Unit 2! For the next six weeks, we focus on planning and delivering effective instruction. Let's start with TEKS."
I DO (15 minutes):
1. Say: "Every lesson you teach must be based on TEKS - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills. These are our state standards."
2. Present: "What are TEKS?"  State-mandated curriculum standards  Define what students should know and be able to do at each grade level  Organized by subject and grade  Used for planning, instruction, and assessment  State tests (STAAR) are based on TEKS
3. Show example: Display actual 3rd grade TEKS for one subject 4. Anatomy of a TEKS statement:
 Subject and grade level  Strand (big category like "Number and Operations")  Standard number  Student expectation (specific skill/knowledge) 5. Example breakdown:  3.4(A): The student is expected to solve with fluency one-step and two-step
problems involving addition and subtraction within 1,000 using strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and the relationship between addition and subtraction. 6. Say: "This TEKS tells you WHAT to teach (two-step problems up to 1,000) and HOW students should learn it (using strategies like place value)." 7. Present "Why TEKS Matter":  Legal requirement for all Texas public schools  Ensure consistency across the state  Guide curriculum, instruction, and testing  Provide vertical alignment (what comes before/after)  Accountability - schools/teachers evaluated on student mastery of TEKS
YOU DO (15 minutes):
1. Provide TEKS documents for elementary grades (or access online) 2. Say: "Choose a grade level and subject you're interested in teaching." 3. Students explore TEKS and complete "TEKS Scavenger Hunt":

 Find and write 3 TEKS from your chosen grade/subject  For each, identify: What knowledge/skill is required?  Identify one TEKS that seems challenging to teach and explain why  Find a TEKS that connects to another subject area 4. Provide worksheet with these prompts
WE DO (15 minutes):
1. Share discoveries 2. Say: "What TEKS did you find interesting? Challenging?" 3. Discuss: "How do TEKS connect across grades? Let's trace one concept." 4. Example on board: Addition in K, 1st, 2nd, 3rd grade - show progression 5. Say: "This is called vertical alignment. Each grade builds on previous learning." 6. Discuss: "How will you use TEKS in your teaching?" 7. Key points:
 Start with TEKS when planning any lesson  Use TEKS to write objectives  Assess based on TEKS  Track which TEKS you've taught
WORK TIME (30 minutes):
 "TEKS Deep Dive Project" (ongoing this week)  Students select 5 TEKS from their chosen elementary grade/subject  For each TEKS, research and document:
1. What prerequisite knowledge do students need? 2. What comes next (vertical alignment)? 3. What are common student misconceptions? 4. What instructional strategies work well? 5. How could you assess mastery?  Begin research using TEA website, curriculum resources  This becomes a teaching resource for practicum
DAY 27 - Tuesday
Objective: Students will explain the rationale for instructional planning components such as vertical alignment, scope and sequence, and backward design.
TEKS: IP (6)(B,C), Practicum (2)
Teacher Script for Substitute:
"Welcome back! Yesterday we learned about TEKS. Today we learn how to organize them into coherent instruction plans."

I DO (15 minutes):
1. Say: "Imagine building a house without blueprints. That's teaching without a plan. Let me show you how teachers plan strategically."
2. Present "Key Planning Concepts": A. Vertical Alignment:  Ensuring learning builds across grade levels  What students learned before and will learn after  Example: Fractions in 2nd (halves, fourths)  3rd (unit fractions)  4th (equivalent fractions)  5th (operations with fractions)
3. B. Scope and Sequence:  Scope: What will be taught (breadth of content)  Sequence: Order in which it will be taught  Logical progression of concepts  Example: Must teach place value BEFORE teaching addition algorithms
4. C. Backward Design (Understanding by Design):  Start with the END in mind  Step 1: Identify desired results (what should students learn?)  Step 2: Determine acceptable evidence (how will you know they learned it?)  Step 3: Plan learning experiences (what activities will get them there?)
5. Say: "Most new teachers make this mistake: They plan activities first, then try to fit standards. That's backward! Always start with your learning goal."
6. Show example of backward design planning:  Desired Result: Students will compare fractions with like denominators  Evidence: Students correctly order 5 fractions from least to greatest  Learning Experiences: Hands-on fraction manipulatives, visual models, practice problems, games
7. Say: "Notice how the assessment and activities flow naturally from the goal."
YOU DO (15 minutes):
1. Provide case study: "Misaligned Planning" 2. Scenario: "A teacher wants to teach 3rd graders about main idea. She plans fun
activities: making posters, acting out stories, and creating bookmarks. Her assessment is matching vocabulary words to definitions." 3. Students analyze using these questions:
 What's the desired learning outcome?  What's the planned assessment?  Do the activities align with the outcome?  What's wrong with this plan?  How would you fix it using backward design? 4. Students write analysis individually
WE DO (15 minutes):
1. Discuss the case study

2. Say: "What did you identify as problems?" 3. Reveal issues:
 Activities are engaging but don't teach main idea  Assessment measures vocabulary, not main idea  No clear alignment 4. Redesign together using backward design:  Desired Result: Students identify main idea and supporting details  Evidence: Students read passages and correctly state main idea in their own
words  Activities: Model thinking aloud, guided practice with text, partner practice,
independent application 5. Say: "See how everything now connects? That's the power of planning backward."
WORK TIME (30 minutes):
 "Backward Design Practice"  Students create a complete backward design plan:
 Choose one TEKS from their research  Write specific learning objective  Design assessment that truly measures the objective  Plan 3-4 learning activities that build toward the objective  Explain how each component aligns  Provide template following the backward design model  These plans will be developed into full lessons later this unit
DAY 28 - Wednesday
Objective: Students will create clear, measurable learning objectives that are developmentally appropriate and aligned to TEKS.
TEKS: IP (6)(E), Practicum (2)
Teacher Script for Substitute:
"Good morning! Today we learn to write the foundation of every lesson: clear, measurable learning objectives."
I DO (15 minutes):
1. Say: "If you don't know where you're going, you'll never get there. Learning objectives tell you AND your students exactly what they'll learn."
2. Present "Components of Effective Objectives":  Audience: Who (the students)  Behavior: What they'll be able to do (observable action)

 Condition: Under what circumstances  Degree: How well (criteria for success) 3. Format: "Students will [verb] [content] [condition] [criteria]" 4. Show examples:  Weak: "Students will learn about fractions" (not observable or measurable)  Strong: "Students will compare fractions with like denominators using <, >, =
symbols with 80% accuracy" 5. Present "Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs" for writing objectives:
 Remember: identify, list, define, recall  Understand: explain, summarize, describe, compare  Apply: demonstrate, solve, use, calculate  Analyze: examine, investigate, categorize, distinguish  Evaluate: judge, critique, justify, assess  Create: design, construct, compose, develop 6. Say: "Use action verbs that you can observe and measure. Avoid vague verbs like 'understand,' 'know,' 'appreciate.'" 7. Emphasize developmentally appropriate objectives:  Consider age, ability level, prior knowledge  Kindergarten: "Students will identify basic shapes"  NOT: "Students will analyze geometric properties" (too advanced)
YOU DO (15 minutes):
1. Objective writing practice 2. Provide 5 weak objectives (handout) 3. Examples:
 "Students will understand the water cycle"  "Learn about adding two-digit numbers"  "Students will know about George Washington" 4. Say: "Rewrite each objective to make it clear, observable, and measurable." 5. Students work independently improving the objectives
WE DO (15 minutes):
1. Share and critique revised objectives 2. For each original objective, call on students to share their improved version 3. Write several on board 4. Class evaluates: "Is this observable? Measurable? Developmentally appropriate?" 5. Refine together 6. Example transformation:
 Original: "Students will understand the water cycle"  Improved: "Students will diagram and label the four stages of the water cycle
(evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection) with 100% accuracy" 7. Say: "Notice how specific this is? The student knows exactly what's expected."

WORK TIME (30 minutes):
 "Objective Writing for Your TEKS"  Using the 5 TEKS students researched:
 Write 2 learning objectives for each TEKS (10 total objectives)  Objectives should vary in Bloom's levels  Include: audience, behavior, condition, degree  Make sure objectives are developmentally appropriate  Connect objectives to assessments from backward design plan  Provide checklist for self-evaluation  Peer review: Exchange with partner for feedback

Teacher Script for Substitute:
"Good morning! Week 8 focuses on the 'why' behind teaching methods. Let's explore instructional theories that drive effective teaching."
I DO (15 minutes):
1. Say: "Why do some teaching methods work better than others? It's because they're based on research about how people learn."
2. Present "Major Instructional Theories": A. Constructivism:  Students build understanding through experiences  Learning is active, not passive  Connect new info to prior knowledge  Teachers are facilitators, not just lecturers  Example: Science experiment where students discover concepts vs. being told
3. B. Active Learning:  Students engage with material through activities  More effective than passive listening

 Methods: discussions, problem-solving, projects, hands-on  Example: Math manipulatives vs. worksheets only 4. C. Direct Instruction:  Teacher-led, structured approach  Explicit teaching of skills/knowledge  Used when efficiency matters  Example: Teaching phonics rules systematically 5. D. Inquiry-Based Learning:  Students ask questions and investigate  Develop critical thinking  Teacher guides discovery  Example: "What do plants need to grow?" - students design experiments 6. Say: "Notice these aren't mutually exclusive. Good teachers use ALL of these depending on the situation." 7.

Show video: Examples of different instructional approaches (5 min)
YOU DO (15 minutes):
1. Theory application activity 2. Provide 8 teaching scenarios 3. Examples:
 Teaching alphabet to kindergarteners  Exploring ecosystems in 4th grade  Practicing multiplication facts  Understanding historical perspectives 4. Say: "For each scenario, identify which instructional theory/approach would be most effective and explain why." 5. Students work independently matching theories to scenarios
WE DO (15 minutes):
1. Discuss matches as a class 2. Say: "Let's compare our thinking. Scenario 1: Teaching alphabet. What did you choose?" 3. Allow respectful debate when students disagree 4. Highlight: "Many scenarios could use multiple approaches. The key is intentional choice
based on your objective and students." 5. Practice combining approaches: "How could you use both direct instruction AND
constructivism to teach addition?" 6. Example: Direct teach algorithm, then use manipulatives for conceptual understanding

WORK TIME (30 minutes):
 "Theory in Action" lesson revision  Students take their lesson plan (from last week):
 Identify which instructional theories are embedded  Revise at least one section to incorporate a different theory  Write rationale explaining why you chose each approach  Consider: Does your lesson have enough active learning? Enough direct
instruction?  Peer consultation: Partner with someone to discuss instructional choices  Refine lesson plans based on theoretical foundations
DAY 32 - Tuesday
Objective: Students will identify and apply methods to adapt lessons to meet various student needs through differentiation strategies.

"Welcome! Today we dive deeper into differentiation - the art of teaching one lesson to many different learners."
I DO (15 minutes):
1. Say: "Remember, every classroom has diverse learners. One-size-fits-all teaching doesn't work. You must differentiate."
2. Review differentiation basics from Unit 1, then go deeper 3. Present "Four Ways to Differentiate" (Carol Tomlinson model): A. Content (What
students learn):  Same concept, different complexity levels  Example: All learn about habitats; advanced students research endangered species
4. B. Process (How students learn):  Different paths to learning  Example: Visual learners use diagrams; kinesthetic learners use manipulatives
5. C. Product (How students demonstrate learning):  Choice in how to show mastery  Example: Test, project, presentation, or video
6. D. Environment (Where/how class is structured):  Flexible seating, quiet spaces, group areas  Example: Some work independently, some in groups

7. Present "Differentiation Strategies for Common Needs":  English Learners: Visuals, sentence stems, preview vocab, partner with buddy  Advanced: Extension activities, deeper questions, leadership roles  Struggling: Scaffolding, more time, simplified materials, small group instruction  Learning Disabilities: Accommodations per IEP, assistive technology
8. Say: "The key is planning for diversity from the start, not adding it as an afterthought." 9. Show tiered assignment example:
