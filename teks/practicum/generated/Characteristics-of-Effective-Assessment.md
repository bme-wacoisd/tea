## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Characteristics of Effective Assessment

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
Define the characteristics of effective assessment.
Evaluate assessments for alignment to characteristics of effective assessment.
Revise assessments for stronger alignment to characteristics of effective assessment
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to identify the key components of effective assessments: alignment with learning targets, fairness and transparency, appropriate level of rigor, appropriate content prioritization, practical, cognitively engaging.
Summary: The tool provides a section for students to record their observations about assessments at the end of a unit of study, with a scale for each Effectiveness Indicator (e.g., “Always,” “Sometimes,” or “Not Observed”). It also provides students the opportunity to apply their knowledge about effective assessments by creating a formative assessment for a lesson within the field site teacher’s unit of study and receiving feedback. Lastly, the tool prompts students to reflect upon their learning experience about the importance of each characteristic of effective assessment.
