| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Mr. Carlos is a veteran teacher who is popular with his students. He often offers extra help after school. Mr. Carlos is tutoring one of his students, Thomas after school currently. Thomas has been a student in several of Mr. Carlos’s classes over the last two years. During this time Mr. Carlos has emailed and texted Thomas’ cellphone using his personal number and email address. At first the exchanges were very general and focused on school-related topics such as progress in class and participation on sports teams. Lately, Thomas has started to text Mr. Carlos more about his personal life and feelings.  Is Mr. Carlos acting in an ethical manner based on the Code of Ethics for Texas teachers? Why or why not? What are some of the potential negative consequences for the teachers or students?

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Read the following quote. Explain what it means in the context of the Code of Ethics for Texas teachers. “Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have the right to do and what is right to do.” – Potter Stewart | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Bellringer Review T: Can I have some volunteers share their responses to the bellringer?  S: Responses may vary but may include: Just because a teacher is allowed to do something by law doesn’t mean that it’s a good decision for them to make. One of the standards in the Code of Ethics for Educators focuses on teachers having good morals. There are lots of things that people have the right to do that don’t show good morals. It’s pretty easy to know some of the things teachers can’t do, like they can’t give drugs to their students. But there are lots of things that they have the right to do that still aren’t okay under the Code of Ethics for Educators.  T: There are lots of things that teachers are allowed to do but that are not a good idea because of their role. Some of the scenarios we considered in the previous lesson were clear; it was obvious that the teacher was, or was not, acting ethically. Today, we’re going to consider a scenario that is more complicated. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Video: Parent-Teacher Relationship Scenario T: I am going to play a short video. Please take notes on the important facts presented in the video in your Student Guide. I will play it twice, so you’ll have a second chance to catch anything you miss.  T: (Play video twice.)  S: (Write important facts in Student Guide.) | Student Guide Video |
| 20 mins | Reflection: Thoughts on Guiding Questions  T: I’m going to divide you into groups of 3-4.   T: (Use classroom routine for dividing into groups.)  T: Before you begin the discussion, select one student to be a spokesperson and one person to be a timekeeper. When we come back together as a group, each spokesperson will share your group’s thoughts on the reflection questions. The timekeeper should make sure that your group discusses all the questions. You don’t have to spend the same amount of time on each question, but you do need to get to all three. Once your group has assigned those two roles, discuss the three reflection questions that appear in your Student Guide. Be sure to write down responses in your Student Guide. You have 9 minutes for your discussion. Begin.  T: (Set timer for 9 minutes.)  S: (Select a spokesperson and a timekeeper and begin work on the reflection questions.)  T: Let’s review what you wrote. If you realize that your group missed something important or answered a question incorrectly, please add to the Student Guide.  T: (Vary the spokespersons selected to share responses so that all groups are represented equally.)  T: According to the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators, has Mr. Lowry behaved ethically?  S (Spokesperson): Mr. Lowry didn’t go anything specifically against the Code of Ethics because he is dating a parent, not a student. But the Code of Ethics does say that he should be of good moral character. There are lots of ways that this situation could hurt the student.  T: What could happen as a result of Mr. Lowry’s relationship with the student’s mother?  S (Spokesperson): Responses may vary but may include: The student could be embarrassed if others find out about his teacher’s relationship.  There is also a risk that Mr. Lowry could treat the student unfairly in relation to his other students. If his relationship is going well, he might give the student better grades than he should get. If the relationship doesn’t go well, he might retaliate against the student.  T: What, if anything, should Mr. Lowry have done differently in this situation?  S: He should have spoken with an administrator at his school as soon as he realized that he was dating the mother of one of his students. There could be local policies about this situation and, even if there are not, the administrator can help Mr. Lowry make an ethical decision about what to do next. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T:  Did you find this discussion to be easy?  S: No. Mr. Lowry didn’t mean to do anything wrong when he started going out with the student’s mom.  S: But, once he knew, he should have told somebody.  T: That’s right. It’s important to remember that some school districts have their own policies that have more details than what is in the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators.  T: This situation is also hard because we need to consider the part of the Code of Ethics that focuses on moral character. It can be hard to determine if a teacher is acting morally. In the end, educators need to make sure students are not harmed by their behavior. | Student Guide |
