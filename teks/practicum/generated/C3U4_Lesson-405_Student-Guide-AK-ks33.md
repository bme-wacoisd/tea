Dos and Don’ts of Productive Struggle

Example of Productive Struggle: A 6th grade teacher gives a challenging word problem to expand on her students’ understanding of surface area. The students work together in groups to solve the problem and display their answers on the white board to review their solutions.
Non-Example of Productive Struggle: A 3rd grade teacher uses a 5th grade math resource to challenge her students when discussing fractions. The students work independently to solve the problem and the teacher takes up their work to review who understood the concept.

| Dos | Don’ts |
| --- | --- |
| Encourage students to work through the struggle by activating their prior knowledge. Support students to use multiple strategies to practice, refine, and revise their understanding. Encourage students to think aloud, write, and draw their ideas. Create an environment in which “embracing the struggle” is accepted and expected. | Create struggles for students that are not appropriate to the TEKS, the content being taught, or the student’s grade level. Productive struggle only occurs when students are striving to reach an achievable goal. Fail to provide supports for students to assist them through the struggle. Use discouraging language when students are exploring new avenues of thinking. |
