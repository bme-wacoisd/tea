# Sequencing-Scaffolding


## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Sequencing & Scaffolding

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Analyze how learning can be sequenced and scaffolded to build toward mastery of content and avoid overload.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe the sequencing and scaffolding as instructional strategies for avoiding cognitive overload and supporting students’ understanding of content.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the field site campus uses sequencing and scaffolding to avoid cognitively overloading students. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students practice planning and/or implementing an instructional activity that intentionally integrates both sequencing and scaffolding to avoid overloading students and to help them understand content.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 4.05:  Prior Knowledge | Practice
Lesson 4.06:  Avoiding Overload | Too Much Information Can Interfere with Learning
TEKS:
- Standard 4: The student understands the learner and the learning process. The student is expected to: (A) relate and implement principles and theories of human development to teaching and training situations; (B) relate and implement principles and theories about the learning process to teaching and training situations; (C) demonstrate techniques for developing effective relationships with students that foster mutual respect and rapport and result in effective instruction.
- Standard 5:  The student interacts effectively in the role of an educator. The student is expected to: (A) demonstrate effective interaction skills with stakeholders such as students, educators, parents/guardians, community members, and other professionals.
- Standard 6:  The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) describe principles and theories that impact instructional planning.

| Preventing Cognitive Overload | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Sequencing: the effective ordering of academic content to support students' understanding of a topic while building on students’ prior knowledge; sequencing relies upon building on prior knowledge to ensure that there are not gaps in student learning. How is the lesson ordered to introduce concepts? How are the learning tasks ordered to move from less challenging to more challenging content? |  |
| Scaffolding: structured supports, such as worked examples, offered to students by the teacher to help students attain a strong command of a new skill and/or concept. What scaffolds do you observe in the lesson and instruction? List all the examples you observe. |  |

| Plan and/or implement an instructional activity that intentionally integrates both sequencing and scaffolding to avoid overloading students and to help them understand content. It is encouraged that the student uses the curriculum already used by the field site teacher, and it is not the expectation that the student makes it up themself. |  |
