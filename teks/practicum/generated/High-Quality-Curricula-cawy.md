Summary: Students are reminded of the characteristics of high-quality instructional materials. They are research-based, closely aligned to rigorous standards, differentiated to meet the needs of all students, and have been rated as high-quality by a team of reviewers. Students are invited to study a set of instructional materials that will be or have been used in a future learning experience and investigate their level of quality. Lastly, students will reflect upon the advantages of high-quality instructional materials and their impact upon students.
