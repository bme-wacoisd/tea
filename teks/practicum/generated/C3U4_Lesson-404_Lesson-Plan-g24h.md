| Objectives | Identify examples of conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Develop example problems to describe how a balance of conceptual and procedural understanding is necessary to building proficiency in mathematics. | Identify examples of conceptual understanding and procedural fluency.

| Rationale/ Summary | There are clear, research-based practices for mathematics instruction, however identifying when to use particular practices in the context of learning can be challenging for new teachers. In this lesson, students will have an opportunity to apply the information they have learned about balancing conceptual understanding and procedural fluency in the context of an elementary mathematics classroom. | There are clear, research-based practices for mathematics instruction, however identifying when to use particular practices in the context of learning can be challenging for new teachers.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Reflect on your experience designing instruction for the math standard you selected. What was challenging about balancing conceptual and procedural instruction? Was one easier to plan for than the other? How does this activity impact your thinking about mathematics instruction?

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Why are both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency important when planning how to teach a lesson? | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Notes: Reviewing Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency T: Before we begin our activity for the day, let us review what you have learned about conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Who can explain the two concepts in your own words?  S: Procedural fluency is the ability to quickly perform mathematical calculations accurately. Conceptual understanding is the ability to access concepts from a number of perspectives and to see math as more than a set of mnemonics or discrete procedures.  T: Great. Why does it matter to consider both types of learning when planning your math instruction?  S: Because both types of learning are consistently present in math instruction. It is more important to focus time on conceptual understanding, but students need to practice procedural fluency while deepening their learning to effectively solve similar problems. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Modeled Example: Designing Instruction for Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency T: Today you are going to have an opportunity to explore the elementary math TEKS and create your own instructional strategies around a TEKS of your choice. You will plan how to teach a lesson that includes both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. I will model an example of what this will look like.  T: Can I have a volunteer read the TEKS I am going to model? S: TEKS Mathematics Grade 3, 3H: “Compare fractions having the same numerator or denominator in problems by reasoning about their size and justifying the conclusion using symbols, objects, and pictorial models.” T: First, I will establish my goal, or objective for the lesson. For this lesson, students will compare fractions with the same denominator and arrange them from least to greatest. T: If I am planning instruction for this standard, I might first want to consider what types of procedural fluency my students should know and how to provide them with practice opportunities. This will also give me a chance to assess where students may struggle with the concept. T: Therefore, I might give them tasks such as these:  Order the following fractions from least to greatest: 1/9, 7/9, 4/9, 2/9, 6/9, 3/9, 5/9 Draw pictures to model each fraction above. T: Next, I want to consider how to assess their understanding of the concept. Instead of giving students multiple problems to compute, which may be more aligned with procedural fluency, I am going to create a word problem or scenario for students to work with. Here is an example  of what I might do:  Create a word problem or scenario for students to solve: Bob has a birdfeeder outside of his house. It holds 8 ounces of bird food. Each morning, he monitors how much of the food was eaten the day before, and then refills it to 8 ounces. He used the chart below to track the food amounts for last week. Use the chart to answer the questions.  T: Then I would have students complete the questions based on the chart. You will notice in your notes that I outlined what types of questions I would want to ask, as well as what the answers to those problems would be. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 20 mins | Practice: Designing Instruction for Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency T: Today you are going to have the opportunity to create your own instructional approach to a TEKS. You may work together with a partner or on your own. Please move to your partner at this time if you are choosing to work with someone else. S: (Move to partner groups, if applicable.) T: Everyone pull up the Elementary Math TEKS website that I have shared on the PPT.  S: (Navigate to the Elementary Math TEKS.) T: It would be best to review the TEKS of the grade level that you are observing in your field experience. Within that grade level, select a TEKS that you are interested in reviewing. Some of the TEKS can be broad, and therefore you will find it helpful to write a goal or objective from that standard to make the task more manageable. T: Please note you are not being asked to write a lesson plan, but to create two learning opportunities for your students—one activity that provides practice for procedural fluency, and one that provides practice for conceptual understanding.  T: Before we begin, let us review the Success Criteria for this assignment. (Display Success Criteria on PPT.) Instructions are clear and appropriate for the grade level. The learning opportunity clearly demonstrates how procedural fluency or conceptual understanding will be practiced. The learning opportunity provides students with enough to practice building on and demonstrate understanding of the skills in the standard/objective. The learning opportunity is designed to meet the intended standard/objective, and the connection can be explained by each group member.  T: Use the table in your Student Guide to organize your thoughts. I will circulate around the classroom to help you if needed. | Student Guide PowerPoint Internet Connected Device Elementary Math TEKS |
| 5 mins | Practice: Designing Instruction for Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency T: I have provided you with some chart paper and markers. On your chart paper, write out your strategies for your classmates to view in a gallery walk during our debrief. S: (Record their strategies on their chart paper.) | Chart Paper Markers |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Everyone take three silent minutes to do a gallery walk and look at your classmates’ work.  S: (Silently participate in gallery walk.)  T: What was challenging about this task?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: What about this did you find helpful when considering instructional activities for future lessons?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: Did anything stand out to you when reviewing your classmates’ work?  S: (Answers will vary.) | Student Guide |
