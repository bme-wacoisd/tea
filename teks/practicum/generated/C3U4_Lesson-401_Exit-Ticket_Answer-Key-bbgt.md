### Lesson 4.01: Balancing Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency

Name:
Date:
Why is using research-based instructional strategies in math important to the academic achievement of all math students?
Research tells us that there are practices that can lead to better student outcomes.
Too often students quickly categorize themselves as students who are good in math or not good at math. When teachers use RBIS, they help all students to recognize that they are capable at math regardless of grade level.

Describe the difference between procedural fluency and conceptual understanding.
Procedural fluency focuses on helping students to complete calculations quickly and accurately. Conceptual understanding builds the ability to access concepts from a number of perspectives and to see math as more than a set of mnemonics or discrete procedures.

Read each scenario and identify whether the scenario is describing procedural fluency or conceptual understanding.
Students are working on memorizing their multiplication facts for the numbers 1-5. Procedural Fluency
Students are asked to show how many tens groups are in the number 65 by drawing a picture.
Conceptual Understanding
Use a number line to find determine the answer of 3 + 5.
Conceptual Understanding
Solve for x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20.
Procedural Fluency
