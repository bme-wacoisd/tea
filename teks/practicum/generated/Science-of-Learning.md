Objectives:
Identify five science of learning principles to guide teaching and learning and explain how they are connected to the simple memory model.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe how the science of learning principles can guide teaching and instructional decision-making.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the field site campus applies the science of learning principles to guide teaching and instructional decision-making. It provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students reflect on their understanding of the science of learning principles and their importance in supporting effective instruction. A table providing an explanation of the Science of Learning Principles is also included as a resource for students.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 4.02:  Science of Learning Principles
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 4: The student understands the learner and the learning process. The student is expected to: (A) relate and implement principles and theories of human development to teaching and training situations; (B) relate and implement principles and theories about the learning process to teaching and training situations; (C) demonstrate and implement behaviors and skills that facilitate learning.
- Standard 5:  The student interacts effectively in the role of an educator. The student is expected to: (A) demonstrate effective interaction skills with stakeholders such as students, educators, parents/guardians, community members, and other professionals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

Science of Learning Principles Explained



| Science of Learning Principles | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Attending: What is the most important content that students are learning in this lesson?  How does the teacher focus learning on the most important content?  How do the learning tasks focus learning on the most important content? |  |
| Prior Knowledge: How does the teacher access and build on prior knowledge? |  |
| Cognitive Overload:  How is learning broken into smaller chunks to avoid causing information overload? (Look for evidence of direct teaching one concept, giving students time to practice or engage with it, and checking understanding before moving on) |  |
| Cognitive Engagement: -What questions does the teacher ask to deepen student understanding?  - What evidence is there that students are being challenged to think and put forth effort? |  |
| Practice with Feedback:  What are students doing to practice the new learning? What positive feedback does the teacher give to students (individually and as a group)? What corrective feedback does the teacher give to students (Individually and as a group)? |  |

| Science of Learning Principles |

| Attending: Focusing on a specific aspect of the environment. In a lesson, focusing on the important content to be learned. Learning requires attending to the most important content. The teacher must direct student’s attention specifically to what they want students to learn. |
| Prior Knowledge: Information or context a learner already has about a topic before they learn new information. Learning builds on prior knowledge. Prior knowledge can help students make connections to new information, better understand new information, and store and retrieve new information. |
| Cognitive Overload: Failure to learn because too much information comes at students too fast, and the working memory cannot hold all of it at once. Overload occurs when the brain becomes weighed down with so much information or data that it exceeds an individual’s capacity to process incoming or new information or data. Too much information at once can interfere with learning. |
| Cognitive Engagement: When students use their brains in the classroom – bringing important ideas into their working memory by being asked questions and completing tasks that make them think hard about a topic and make meaning. Students should use their brains during the entire lesson and should be asked questions and complete tasks that make them think hard about a topic, not just repeat a surface level understanding of facts. Learning requires cognitive engagement and should be effortful. |
| Practice with Feedback: Practice: Trying a skill or task, especially one you have not yet mastered, in order to improve your performance.  Feedback: Giving students information about their performance during practice with the purpose of improving student performance. The process of practicing and incorporating feedback makes the working memory work very hard and helps students fully understand content and store ideas in their long-term memory. Practice and feedback are essential to move ideas permanently into long-term memory. |
