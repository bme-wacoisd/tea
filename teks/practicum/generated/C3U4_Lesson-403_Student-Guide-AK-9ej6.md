### Lesson 4.03: Balancing Conceptual and Procedural Understanding: Misconceptions

Bellringer: In your own words, explain the difference between procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. Provide an example of when each would be used in a math classroom.
Conceptual Understanding is the ability to access concepts from several perspectives and to see math as more than a set of mnemonics or discrete procedures. Procedural fluency is the ability to quickly perform mathematical calculations accurately. Both are used consistently in the math classroom; procedural fluency is used when performing calculations (such as finding area of a rectangle through the formular A=L x  W x H), whereas conceptual understanding is applying math skills in a way that demonstrates understanding of the concept (such as understanding what area is and why the length, width, and height measurements are used to find the area.)

Notes: Building Conceptual and Procedural Understanding: Misconceptions

Misconception #1: Teachers should spend equal time on Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency.

Both are important, but conceptual understanding takes more time.
Conceptual understanding challenges the student to understand why they are following certain steps to solve a problem, even in the context of new situations.
Conceptual understanding allows the student to check for reasonableness of their answer.

Misconception #2: Procedural Fluency is just practicing facts.
Procedural fluency is not just knowing what to do in a math problem, but when and how to do it.

Misconception #3: Procedural Fluency happens before conceptual understanding.

Teachers sometimes believe that students need to master every procedure to understand math conceptually, but that is not the case.
Understanding ideas conceptually can occur before they have math facts memorized.

|  | Evidence From the Lesson |
| --- | --- |
| Procedural Fluency | Students practice group counting forward and backward (sixes, sevens, eights, and nines) Students will use arrays to model and practice writing number sentences (multiplication). Students will observe models of varying rectangles with an area of 8 square units to demonstrate that the same number of units within an object can look different. |
| Conceptual Understanding | Students will practice modeling different rectangles (drawing and using square inch tiles) to find area. Students will apply the concept they have practices with drawings and square inch  tiles to find area of drawn rectangles using a ruler as well as counting unit squares within the shape. |
