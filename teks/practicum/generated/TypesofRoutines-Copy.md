Objectives:
- Explain the importance of systems and routines in creating a safe and effective classroom.
- Define and identify academic, behavioral, and classroom routines.
- Students will practice routines for entering the classroom, turning in work, getting the attention of the class, participating in discussions, etc.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is to provide students with the opportunity to observe how systems and routines contribute to the creation of a joyful and focused classroom.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of academic, behavioral, and classroom systems and routines. It also provides conversations starters for students to use with their field site campus teachers to learn more about how the observed systems and routines contribute to the creation of a safe and effective classroom. Lastly, students are asked to engage students in the execution of a system or routine, discuss feedback from the field site campus teacher, and reflect upon the experience.
