Objectives:
- Observe and reflect on the components of a high-quality lesson plan.
- Explore and reflect on how a high-quality lesson plan leads to mastery of grade-level content.
- Rehearse and teach part or all of a lesson plan.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to learn about lesson planning, to rehearse and teach part or all of a lesson plan, and to promote reflection on the relationship between high-quality lesson plans and student learning experiences.
Summary: This tool invites the student to interview the field site campus teacher to learn more about their favorite lesson to teach and consider how the essential components of lesson planning facilitate teaching and learning. Next, students will rehearse and teach part or all of a lesson plan and discuss feedback with the field site teacher. Lastly, students are asked to reflect upon essential components and how students should interact with standards and objectives.
