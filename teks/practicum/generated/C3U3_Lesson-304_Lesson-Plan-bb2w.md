| Rationale/ Summary | Deliberate practice of skills in and out of text is essential to literacy instruction. When students immediately apply newly learned skills to text, they are more likely to improve their decoding abilities. In this lesson, students will learn the difference between practice “in text” and practice “out of text” and why both are important to building literacy skills. Students will examine lesson plans for evidence of deliberate practice both in and out of text and explain the impact it has on student learning. | Deliberate practice of skills in and out of text is essential to literacy instruction.

|  | Prepare to show a video of decodable words in isolation and in text to students. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Complete the Anticipation Guide to review the criteria for deliberate practice. Based on the Anticipation Guide, what are the criteria for deliberate practice that you explored in previous units? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | T: (Quickly review responses to the statements in the Anticipation Guide.) |  |
| 12 mins | Discussion: Introduction to Practice in and Out of Text T: (Share key definitions with PPT.)  T: What do you remember about practice?  S: It should perform the learning goal.  T: With foundational literacy instruction, it is especially important that students practice the same skills they were explicitly taught during the direct instruction.   T: Practice should also be interactive or require active student participation. Students should have opportunities to practice skills in different modalities, or forms of sensory perception, such as moving tiles into sounds boxes, using hand gestures to support memory, building words with letter tiles, writing letters, and speaking the sounds.  T: Why is it important for students to practice the skills in different modalities?  S: Students need to see the skill represented in different ways.  T: Multisensory activities provide scaffolding to beginning and struggling readers and include visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile activities to enhance learning and memory.  T: Practice should also be both in and out of text. Students should practice the skill in isolation, or “out of text,” then apply that skill to a text, or “in text.”   T: Why is it important for students to practice skills both in and out of text?   S: Students need to be able to apply what they learned in isolation to an actual text.  T: “When students have the opportunity to immediately apply newly learned skills to their reading, they are more likely to use decoding strategies to read unfamiliar words and are more skillful at decoding” (Hatcher, Hulme, & Ellis, 1994; Cheatham & Allor, 2012).   T: One way to practice skills out of context is with a decodable text. A decodable text is a type of text that contains only the sound-letter relationships that have previously been taught. Decodables generally follow a scope and sequence and progress in skills. Because a specific phonics pattern is clearly identifiable and repeated throughout the decodable, students have multiple opportunities to practice the skill for proficiency.  S: (Add definitions to chart in Student Guide.)  T: (Share video via PPT.) Let us look at a quick video clip to see decodable words in isolation and in text. As you watch, record ways the students practice /ee/ both in isolation and in text.   T: (Provide time for students to record evidence in Student Guide after video plays.)  S: (Record evidence in Student Guide while video is playing and after it is complete.)  T: How did students practice /ee/ in isolation?  S: The students practiced the sound /ee/ with the spelling ‘ee’ and ‘ea’ in the words ‘meat’ and ‘seed'. Students were given a list of words where they had to underline the ‘ee’ and ‘ea’ in words. The students sounded the list of words out together to read them. The words contained /ee/, /e/, and /a/ so students could practice reading words that contained the /ee/ sound or that were short vowels to see the difference in sounds between the short /e/ and long /ee/.  T: How did students practice /ee/ in text?  S: Students were given the text “Up in the Trees.” They had to look for words in the text that had the ‘ee’ or ‘ea’ spelling, underline them, and read them. Students read the book “Up in the Trees” to practice the /ee/ sound with ‘ee’ and ‘ea.’  T: Why is deliberate practice of skills in and out of context important?  S: Students need multiple opportunities to practice the new skills and receive corrective feedback. When students immediately apply newly learned skills to their reading, they are more likely to use decoding strategies to read unfamiliar words and are more skillful at decoding. This process helps students move their learning from short-term memory to long-term memory. | PPT Student Guide Video |
| 17 mins | Practice: Lesson Review T: Review the materials excerpted from Grade 1, Unit 3, Lesson 12. List ways the lesson provides opportunities for students to practice in isolation and in the text. Record evidence in the graphic organizer.  S: (Students complete graphic organizer in Student Guide). | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Debrief T: How did the lesson offer opportunities for students to practice the skill in and out of text?  S: For out of text, students start by repeating the sound /oi/ several times and repeating words that have the /oi/ sound at the beginning, middle, and end. Students practice writing the vowel sound /oi/ by tracing it with their finger on their desks. Students give words in which ‘oi’ stands for /oi/. Students use Activity Page 12.1 to practice saying the sound of each letter team and single letter spelling that they write, going sound by sound to write the words. On the back, students read words and write each word under its matching picture. For the text, students read “The Bag of Coins” to practice /oi/ and another previously taught skill – /ou/. Prior to reading, students review spellings in the text that practice previously taught skills – ‘ou’ and /ou/ and ‘oi’ as /oi/.   T: Why is deliberate practice of phonics skills both in and out of text essential to building students’ literacy skills?   S: Students can practice the skills in different contexts. They apply what they learned in isolation to a text, which is the goal. Frequent practice of newly learned skills helps move student learning from the short-term memory to the long-term memory and builds students confidence and skills to use decoding strategies to re unfamiliar words. | Student Guide |
