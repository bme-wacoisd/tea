The Superintendent of our school district because he decides when we go to school.



Notes: Federalism as a Governance Model
Federalism: a form of government in which power is divided between state and national levels
Federal: has two definitions:
Describes a nation in which the power is divided between state and national levels.
Used to: describe a country’s type of government.
Describes something associated with the national level of government.

Notes: Federal Governance of Education in the United States
The federal government has less control than states and districts over what happens in schools.




Notes: Roles of State Government in Education in the United States

Per state constitutions, the ultimate responsibility of a state is to provide education to students.



Texas State Board of Education: sets policies and standards for public schools in Texas. The State Board of Education makes decisions by voting.



Texas State Board for Educator Certification: oversees the preparation, certification, and ethical standards for educators in public schools. The State Board for Educator Certification makes decisions by voting.



Texas Education Agency (TEA): provides leadership, guidance, and support for all public school students. TEA also supports the members of the two boards above. The Commissioner of Education makes some decisions, but other decisions are made by individual staff members who work there.





Texas Legislature: makes decisions on many policy areas, including education. They decide on the amount of state money that is used to support education and how that money is distributed. They also pass laws with requirements for schools and districts.
