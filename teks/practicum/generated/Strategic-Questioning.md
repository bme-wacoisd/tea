## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Strategic Questioning

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Observe and reflect on the characteristics of effective questions.
- Evaluate and practice creating questions according to the characteristics of effective questions.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to use the Wiederhold Question Matrix as an observation device, provide additional experience with composing effective questions, and to reflect upon effective question delivery criteria.
Summary: The tool provides an observation section for students to tally the depth of thinking for each question posed in one or more lessons using the Wiederhold Question Matrix. Students next have the opportunity to compose five or more questions for an upcoming lesson, ensuring they meet all characteristics of effective questions. They must be meaningful and understandable to students (succinct), focused on the most important content, aligned to the level of thinking required in the learning target, and demonstrative of increasing levels of complexity and demand. Lastly, students are asked to reflect upon the impact of strategic questioning.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 5.05: Introduction to Strategic Questioning
