Date:
Objectives:
Identify how classroom systems and routines contribute to a safe and effective classroom environment.
- Practice implementing routines for entering the classroom, beginning class, turning in work, getting the attention of the class, transitions, and participating in discussions.
- Identify elements of classroom routines that lead to a safe and effective learning environment.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is to provide students with the opportunity to observe how the implementation and modeling of systems and routines for entering the classroom, beginning class, turning in work, getting the attention of the class, transitions, and participating in discussions contribute to a safe and effective classroom environment.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of routines and systems, including:
- entering the classroom,
- beginning class,
- turning in work,
- getting the attention of the class,
- transitions,
- and participating in discussions.
It also provides conversations starters for students to use with their field site campus teachers to learn more about how the observed systems and routines contribute to a safe and effective classroom environment. Lastly, students are asked to implement systems and routines, discuss feedback from the field site campus teacher, and reflect upon the experience.
