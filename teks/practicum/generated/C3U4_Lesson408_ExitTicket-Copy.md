### Lesson 4.08: A UDL Approach to Math

Name:
Date:
In your field site, you may have seen teachers use different UDL practices in math. Now is your opportunity to share the great examples of UDL you have seen in your field site or suggest opportunities where UDL could be used with the class. You can choose how you want to share your learning. You may choose to write your response, create a video, perform a skit, develop a poster, etc. If you have seen UDL in math during your field experience, describe a few examples and tell the outcome. If you have not seen teachers use UDL practices in math, provide examples of a few opportunities where they could have done so. How could they have engaged students in a more productive way? How does a UDL approach promote more accessible outcomes for all students?
