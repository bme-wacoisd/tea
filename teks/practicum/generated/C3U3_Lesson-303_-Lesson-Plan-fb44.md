| Objectives | Apply an understanding of explicit and systematic instruction to practice and deliver foundational literacy skills from High Quality Instructional Materials. | Apply an understanding of explicit and systematic instruction to practice and deliver foundational literacy skills from High Quality Instructional Materials. | Apply an understanding of explicit and systematic instruction to practice and deliver foundational literacy skills from High Quality Instructional Materials. |
| Rationale/ Summary | Students who receive systematic and explicit phonics instruction are better readers at the end of instruction than students who receive non-systematic or no phonics instruction. Instruction in foundational literacy should be systematic and explicit and include practice of specific skills both in and out of text. In this lesson, students will plan and teach an explicit phonics lesson from High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) to a small group. | Students who receive systematic and explicit phonics instruction are better readers at the end of instruction than students who receive non-systematic or no phonics instruction.

|  | Prepare a copy of the Grade 1 Unit 3 Lesson 15, pages 172-174 for each student. |  |
|  | Prepare to show a video of phonics instruction to students. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Analyze the scenario to determine if the instruction is explicit and systematic. Place a check in the box to indicate if each criterion for explicit and systematic instruction is evident in the scenario. Then, explain how this scenario supports phonics instruction and explain where the instruction falls within the simple view of reading. | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | T: Stand up and pair up with a partner. Share your response and you are reasoning for each statement with your partner.  S: (Stand up and pair up and share responses and reasoning.)  T: (Quickly review responses to the scenario.) | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Review Systematic and Explicit Literacy Instruction T: In our previous lesson, we learned about explicit and systematic instruction. Let us review the criteria for successful systematic and explicit instruction.   S: (Review notes from previous lesson.)  T: Why is it important for learners to have systematic and explicit instruction?  S: It provides direct teaching and modeling that introduces skills in a logical sequence to build on students’ prior knowledge. Most learners require a structured literacy approach to learn how to read because learning to read is not a natural process. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 1: Video Analysis T: Let us observe a 1st grade teacher as she engages students in a phonics lesson on the long “I” sound. As you watch, observe how well the teacher instruction aligns to the success criteria for explicit and systematic instruction and record notes in the chart in your student guide.   T: (Play video. Stop at 7:40.)  S: (Watch video and take notes in Student Guide.)  T: How did the teacher’s instruction align to the success criteria?  S: The teacher met all the criteria. | Video Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice 2: Role-play T: With a partner, you are going to role-play a portion of the Grade 1 Unit 3 Lesson 15, pages 172-174.   T: (Provide students with a copy of the lesson plan.)  T: (Divide students into pairs.)  T: Each group member will choose a section from the lesson plan to read and teach to the group. While the “teacher” is delivering the instruction, the other group members will provide feedback on how well the teacher instruction aligns to the success criteria for explicit and systematic instruction. At the end of each turn, group members will have 2 minutes to share feedback.  T: Here are the sections you can choose to role-play:  Introduce the Sound /aw/ Introduce the Spelling /aw/ > ‘aw’  S: (Move into groups and assign sections.)  S: Complete role-play activity and record feedback in the Student Guide.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: How did it feel to deliver an explicit phonics lesson?  S: Responses will vary.  T: As the “students,” what was helpful about the explicit instruction?  S: The instruction was clear, taught in manageable steps, and allowed for active participation. The lesson also built on previously learned skills which helped me make connections. There was also an opportunity for the teacher to check for my understanding to make sure I was on track.   T: How does explicit instruction help build student understanding?  S: Explicit instruction helps build student understanding by scaffolding the concepts and skills into learnable steps. The teacher provides clear and direct teaching through modeling that allows students to see how to perform each step of a process as well as understand the connections between each step and why each step is important. The explicit instruction built on students’ prior knowledge of previously taught skills and provided frequent opportunities for students to actively participate. |  |
