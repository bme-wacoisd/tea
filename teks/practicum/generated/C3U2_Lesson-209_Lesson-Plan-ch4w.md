| 3 mins | Bellringer:  Why is it important to have a code of ethics for educators? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | T: In our previous lesson we discussed what the Texas Code of Ethics looks like for educators. Why is it important to have a code of ethics for educators? S: It protects the rights of students by explaining what appropriate conduct is for an educator. T: Does anyone else have an idea about why it is important to have a code of ethics for educators? S: A common code of ethics makes sure that everyone knows what ethical conduct looks like for teachers. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Notes: Educator Code of Ethics T: Now that we are familiar with the ethical code for educators in Texas, we can discuss what happens when an educator violates the ethical code of conduct.  T: In Texas, the SBEC, or the State Board of Educator Certification (SBEC), is the governing body that oversees all aspects of the preparation, certification, and standards of conduct of public-school teachers. Notice I said public school teachers. Do teachers at private schools have to follow the rules and guidelines as public-school teachers?  S: They don’t have to follow the same rules or guidelines for certification, but the ethical conduct expected is likely the same.  T: If an educator is believed to have violated the Educator Code of Conduct, an allegation of misconduct can be filed to the SBEC. Who do you think can file allegations of misconduct against an educator?  S: School districts or schools.  T: Most of the time the allegations may be filed by the school district or school district officials; however, anyone can file an allegation of misconduct against an educator. Remember, the code of conduct emphasizes the safety and welfare of students and ensures that educators are “morally fit and worthy to instruct and supervise children.”   Do you think a complaint can be filed about an educator’s conduct outside of a school building?  S: The code of conduct extends beyond the school. Educators can’t break the law.  T: Teachers must be of good moral character and that means both inside and outside of the classroom. The SBEC will prioritize investigations based on the severity and immediacy of the claim, as well as the likelihood of harm to the subject of the investigation. Once a claim is filed, what do you think is the next step?  S: The SBEC will investigate the claim.  T: The SBEC will thoroughly investigate the claim and hold disciplinary hearings to review findings and disciplinary measures that will be taken in the case. Here are some of the examples of disciplinary measures that can be taken by the SBEC toward educators. They are listed in your Student Guide under Notes: Educator Code of Ethics. Place restrictions on issuing, renewing, or holding of an educator’s certificate either indefinitely or for a set term; Issue an inscribed or non-inscribed reprimand; Suspend a certificate for a set term or issue a probated suspension for a set term; Revoke or cancel a certificate without opportunity for reapplications for a set term or permanently; and/or Impose any additional conductions or restrictions deemed necessary by SBEC.  T: There are a lot of legal terms here that you may be unfamiliar with, so let’s go through these to make sure everyone understands what each action means. Can someone read the first action that can be taken along with its description?  S: (Reads first action & description listed in table.)  T: So, for example a teacher may not be allowed to hold a teaching certificate in Texas for 5 years as a result of disciplinary findings.   T: Can someone read the second action and description from the table?   S: (Reads second action and description listed in table.)  T:  So, this might look like a formal statement that is written on the front of a teaching certificate that informs others of disciplinary findings. Can someone read the third action and description from the table?  S: (Reads third action and description listed in table.)  T: Probated suspension is like probation. For example, the SBEC may allow the teacher to keep their certificate but place the educator on probation for 18 months.  During this time the educator may have limits to their certificate, and they will be watched closely for any concerns during that time. Any additional violations will result in loss of certificate.  Can someone read the fourth action and description?  S: (Reads fourth action listed in the table.)  T: To revoke a certificate or cancel it means to make it no longer valid. In the case of the fourth action, and example might be if a violation is very serious the SBEC would take away the teacher’s certificate and not allow the individual to every have a certificate in the state of Texas again. Can someone read the last action and description listed in the table?  S: (Reads last action listed in the table.)  T: That statement may seem broad and unspecific, but it provides flexibility to the SBEC to how they may discipline teachers in unique situations. A broad statement like this allows the SBEC the discretion to come up with disciplinary measures that are appropriate for different and unique situations if it meets the disciplinary policy guidelines. For example, they may require specialized training for a teacher in ethical decision making during a probationary period rather that simply taking the certificate away or only putting that teacher on probation.  T: Now, you will get a chance to explore another way that the SBEC keeps students safe: the Texas Do Not Hire Registry. | Student Guide PPT |
| 12 mins | Research: Do Not Hire Registry (Students will be using computers to do web-based research with this activity.  Prepare for students to have access to computers ahead of time to complete this activity.) T: In a minute, you will have the opportunity to do some web-based research on another effort to keep students safe, the Texas Do Not Hire Registry. Before we get started, I want to define the term non-certified employee. What do you think we mean when we say non-certified?  S: Someone who doesn’t have a teaching certification.  T: A non-certified employee is someone who works in the school but does not require a teaching certificate to qualify for the job. Can you think of any examples of job in a school that might be considered non-certified?  S: Secretaries, custodians, cafeteria workers, instructional assistants, coaches.  T: So certified employees are those who need a teaching certificate for their role (teachers, administrators, counselors) and non-certified are employees that do not need a teaching certificate for their role (coaches, instructional assistants, secretaries, custodians, cafeteria workers).   T: With a partner, you will do some research on the Texas Do Not Hire Registry. You can locate information about the registry through the website linked under Research: Do Not Hire Registry section on your Student Guide. Once you access the website, you will need to answer the five questions in your Student Guide. You will have 10 minutes to complete this task. What questions do you have for me?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: Please find your partner and begin working. I will set a timer for 10 minutes and let you know when your time is up.   T: (Set 10-minute timer.)  S: (Access website and answer questions from Student Guide.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let’s take a few minutes to go through the answers you found with the research on the Do Not Hire Registry.  What is the Do Not Hire Registry?  S: List of individuals that are not eligible for hire in Texas public schools because of criminal history or misconduct.  T: Who is included on the Do Not Hire Registry?  S: Non-certified employees or those individuals that have had their teaching license revoked.  T: What are the two reasons that someone might be listed on the Do Not Hire Registry?  S: They have a certain criminal history or have abused or engaged in inappropriate relationships with students or minors.  T: What are the four category definitions found on the registry?  S: Not eligible for hire, under investigation, date on registry, and approximate age.  T: What information do you need to search someone on the registry?  S: First and last name.  T: If someone in the school violates the Code of Ethics, there are two ways that they can be listed. If they are non-certified, they go on the Do Not Hire Registry. If they are certified, then the SBEC can act against them. What are some of the actions that the SBEC can take against individuals who have or are applying for certification?  S: Place restrictions on an educator’s certificate, can issue an inscribed or uninscribed reprimand, suspend a certificate for a set term or issue a probated suspension, revoke, or cancel a certificate or impose any additional conditions deemed necessary. |  |
