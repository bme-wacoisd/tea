### Guided Practice: Scenarios on Ethics

- Mr. Jones is walking by another classroom when he hears a teacher getting sick. He sticks his head into the classroom and asks if she needs any help. The teacher apologizes and says that she is taking medication for a serious medical condition and that it makes her nauseous. Mr. Jones wants to make sure that this teacher gets the help she needs, so he tells the principal and the other teachers who have classrooms in that hallway.

## Slide 5

### Exit Ticket

- Mrs. Jacobs, a 7th grade math teacher, is frustrated by the effort of a student in her class. She stops by the neighboring teacher’s classroom to vent. In sharing the story, Mrs. Jacobs tells the other teacher about the student, identifying the student’s name and providing specific details about the student’s academic record. Since the neighboring teacher doesn’t know the student personally, Mrs. Jacobs feels that there shouldn’t be a problem discussing the student and the situation.
- Is Mrs. Jacobs acting in an ethical manner based on the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators? Why or why not?
- What are some of the potential negative consequences for the teachers or students?
- How could Mrs. Jacobs have acted in a more ethical manner?
