### Lesson 2.02: What is Professionalism?

Name:
Date:
Complete the following questions:
- Why is it important to demonstrate professional conduct, dress, and communication at your E&T field site? How might unprofessional behavior impact your future as well as impact the students and teachers you are working with?
- Professionalism communicates that you take your role seriously and want to do your best. It also builds trust and respect with students, families, administration, and colleagues. Unprofessional behavior could impact my future because it may show potential employers that I’m not serious about my future career or am not prepared to be an educator. Unprofessional behavior can impact my students because it can take away from their learning and communicates that I do not have high expectations or respect for their futures. It can impact the teachers I’m working with by taking away from their high-quality teaching and could put them in an uncomfortable situation depending on the situation.

Analyze the scenarios below. Determine if the educator behaviors are professional (P) or not professional (NP) and explain the message the teacher is sending through their actions.






| Scenario | Professional (P) or Not Professional (NP) | What message does this send to others? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The school’s afterschool running program has been cancelled due to the lack of coaches. After talking with his administration, Mr. Hall contacts some former student athletes to come in and run with his students afterschool. | P | This communicates dedication and commitment to his students. It sends the message to his students that he values their interests. |
| Ms. Ramon received a phone call from an irate parent. The parent is upset because Ms. Ramon gave her student silent lunch. Mr. Ramon tries to explain that the student received silent lunch because she continuously talked during the instruction and disrupted the other students in the class. Ms. Ramon quickly becomes frustrated as the parent continues to yell. Mr. Ramon begins to yell back at the parent and eventually hangs up on her. | NP | This communicates to the parent that you do not value their voice. Although the teacher shouldn’t tolerate being yelled at by parents, the teacher could have set up a time to meet with the parent, child, and administration to further discuss the situation. |
