Modeling: Characteristics of Effective Communication through Conflict

Scenario:
Mrs. Jessup is an 8th grade math teacher.  She recently administered an end of unit math test, and, as she returned them to students, she notices that a lot of her students didn’t seem to do well on the test.  Maria is a student in Ms. Jessup’s math class.  When she received her test back, she saw that she received a 65%.  Maria is extremely upset about this score and doesn’t believe it can be right.  As she reviews the test, she notices several questions marked incorrectly that she believes to be right.  Maria approaches Ms. Jessup visibly upset with her test in hand ready to argue her points.
What characteristics of effective communication through conflict did you observe in this role play?
Ms. Jessup made eye contact and actively listened to Maria’s concerns.
Even though Maria was upset, Ms. Jessup used a calm voice.  She also acknowledged the fact that Maria looked upset and told her they would figure it out together.
Ms. Jessup didn’t get upset with Maria when she raised her voice.  She confronted the situation of the incorrect answers, not maria’s yelling.  Also, she said “I might have made a mistake”.

Practice: Effective Communication through Conflict Role Play
Scenario 1:  Mr. Cole is a 3rd grade elementary teacher.  In his class yesterday, two students, Devon and Marissa, got into an argument during recess.  This resulted in Devon pushing Marissa.  When Mr. Cole observed the behavior, he responded immediately, checking to make sure Marissa was ok, and he reported the incident to his administrator, who called Devon’s parents.  This morning when Mr. Cole came into school, Marissa’s father was waiting for him, very upset about the fact that Marissa was physically assaulted, and he didn’t get a phone call.

Scenario 3: Jeramiah is a first-year teacher who is working with a group of experienced teachers to plan the next unit in his high school social studies class.  As the group is discussing what activities to incorporate in the unit, Jeramiah shares an idea for a new project.  The group leader, Thomas, immediately dismisses his idea, saying “The students aren’t capable of creating a project like that and, plus, there isn’t any time to do all that.”   Jeramiah is frustrated because it seems that Thomas and the rest of the group never listen to his input or consider his ideas to improve the instructional activities.  Jeramiah decides to approach Thomas after the meeting to discuss his concerns.
