| Rationale/ Summary | Reading, writing, and speaking about text reinforce student comprehension of content. Asking students to respond to questions by using evidence is an important strategy for enhancing fairness in classrooms. When students can base their answers on evidence provided to them, their success is dependent on their analysis of that information, not prior knowledge they may bring to the classroom. | Reading, writing, and speaking about text reinforce student comprehension of content.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Read the scenario and two prompts below.  Ms. K’s class just finished Not Norman: A Goldfish Story together. The book tells the story of Norman, a goldfish whose young owner wanted a different kind of pet, like a dog. Prompt #1 Why did Norman’s owner want a pet other than a goldfish? Prompt #2 Have you ever wanted a different kind of pet than the one you have? Why did you want a different animal? Identify whether a student can answer each prompt without support from the text or if the text would be needed to answer the question. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Strengthening Comprehension through Reading, Writing, and Speaking T: In your bellringer, you considered two prompts that Ms. K. might ask her class after reading a story with them. Can a student answer Prompt #1 without knowing what happened in the text?  S: No, they need to have read the story to answer the question.  T: How about Prompt #2?  S: A student could answer that one even if they did not listen to the story.  T: If an educator’s goal is to increase our students’ comprehension of what they read, which prompt is the better choice?  S: The first one.  T: That is right. When students respond to the first prompt, they must use the information that appeared in the text.   T: Reading, writing, and speaking are building blocks; writing and speaking about what you read strengthens your comprehension.   S: (Add skills to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: Students can remember what they learn in more detail and for longer when teachers ask them to use evidence from what they read when they speak or write.  S: (Add answer to question in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: The Value of Evidence-Based Writing T: Today, we are going to focus on evidence-based writing, so we will be taking a close look at how asking students to use what they have read in their writing builds their understanding.  T: Evidence-based writing consists of writing activities that engage students in using information from what they have learned to support their answers to prompts.  S: (Add definition to chart in Student Guide.)  T: Evidence-based writing is important for two main reasons. First, it is one of the skills that students need to be successful in their educational pursuits after high school. Second, it is a strategy that teachers can use to promote fairness for all students. We will dig into each of these reasons in more depth.  S: (Add reasons to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: When we ask college instructors to describe the skills that they expect of their students, they point to students’ ability to identify, evaluate, and use evidence to make an argument or argue against a specific point of view.  T: Yet these same college instructors report that students do not bring this skill to college. One of the reasons that students do not graduate with this skill is because teachers often give assignments that ask students to write about their own knowledge and experiences. Students do not receive enough writing assignments that ask them to pull information from the text. Giving students more of these types of evidence-based writing experiences will help better prepare them for education after high school.  T: Look back in your Student Guide. What is the second reason that evidence-based writing is important?  S: It increases fairness.  T: When teachers require students to engage in evidence-based writing, they are creating a fair environment in which all students can be successful.   T: Look at today’s Bellringer again, specifically, Prompt #2. Do you have any concerns about this prompt?  S: What if a student has never had a pet? They cannot answer the question.  S: Maybe a student has had a pet, but they always loved it and never wanted a different kind. They cannot answer the question either.  T: These are all great points! When we ask students to respond to questions about their background knowledge or personal experiences, some of them might have difficulty answering. They may not have had the experiences that the questions reference; in this case, some students may not have ever had a pet.  T: When teachers ask students to respond to prompts with evidence-based writing, we know that all students have the same opportunity to be successful. They all read the same text and engaged in the same learning experiences that are needed to successfully answer the questions. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Evaluating Assessments for Evidence-Based Writing T: We are going to think about some possible prompts that a teacher could give to students who have just finished reading Alice in Wonderland.   T. In your Student Guide, you will find examples of questions that the teacher could ask. Read those silently to yourself.  S: (Read example prompts in Student Guide.)  T: Which prompt includes evidence-based writing?  S: They both do.  S: (Add answers to questions in Student Guide.)  T: Where do you see evidence-based writing in Prompt #1?  S: To answer the question, you need to know what happened in the story when Alice met the characters.   T: Where do you see evidence-based writing in Prompt #2?  S: To answer the question, you need to know what happened when Alice got to Wonderland. If you know that, you can write about how she probably felt.  T: You have identified how both prompts ask students to engage in evidence-based writing. One of these prompts, however, is stronger than the other. Which one is better?  S: The first one.  T: Why?  S: Because the first one is all about evidence-based writing. In the second one, part of the question asks for evidence-based writing, but part of it asks about how a student would respond if they were in a new place.  S: (Add answer to question in Student Guide.)  T: We said that one of the reasons teachers should use evidence-based writing is to increase access for students. Which of these prompts is more accessible? Why?  S: The first one is more accessible. In the second one, students need to think about how they would respond if they were in a brand-new place. What about students who always go to places in their town? They might not know how to answer the question.  T: Now, you are going to look at some other examples of prompts on your own. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Evidence-Based Writing in Action T: In your Student Guide, you will find examples of assessment questions for fifth grade students. Read each one and respond to the questions in your Student Guide.  S: (Review each prompt and respond to questions in Student Guide).  T: We will now review the answers. If you need to update any of your answers, please do so.  T: Which of these prompts requires evidence-based writing?  S: The second prompt.  T: That is right. How did you know it was the one that requires evidence-based writing?  S: The student needs to use what they read in the text to answer the question.  T: Great! Which of these prompts is more accessible for all students?  S: The second one.  T: That is right. How does this prompt support fairness for all students?  S: Students do not need to know anything about Michelangelo to answer the question. All the information they need is in the text.  T: Let us expand our thinking beyond the questions in your Student Guide. Consider Prompt #1. How is this prompt not fair or accessible to all students?  S: There might be students who do not know about different types of art. They cannot answer the question as successfully as other students who have more knowledge about the topic. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let us review what we learned.  T: What is evidence-based writing?  S: It is writing activities that engage students in using information from what they have learned to support their answers to prompts.  T: If a prompt asks a student to use examples from a story, they read to answer a question, is it an example of evidence-based writing?  S: Yes.  T: If a prompt asks a student to write about an experience, they have had that is similar to a story they read, is it an example of evidence-based writing?  S: No.  T: How does evidence-based writing advance accessibility for all students?  S: When teachers ask students to respond to prompts with evidence-based writing, we know that all students have the same opportunity to be successful. They all read the same text and engaged in the same learning experiences that are needed to successfully answer the questions. |  |
