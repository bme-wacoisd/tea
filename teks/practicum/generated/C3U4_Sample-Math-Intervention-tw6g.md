Sample Math Intervention Scenario
RBIS Math Portfolio Project

Ms. Q is about to begin her third math unit in her second-grade class. She wants you to plan and implement a just-in-time intervention to support students who may need review before engaging with grade-level content. She has compiled the following resources to help you identify the areas where students need support and plan when and how you will provide the intervention.

For context:
- Ms. Q has a 90-minute math block, and she has the flexibility to use the first or last thirty minutes for interventions or extension.
- Ms. Q is unable to administer a pre-assessment for each unit, so she is using data from a diagnostic assessment she gave at the beginning of the year.


Grade-Level and Foundational TEKS

Student Assessment Data
The following data points show student proficiency in the first grade TEKS based on a diagnostic assessment given at the beginning of the school year. 22 students

HQIM Scope and Sequence
Ms. Q uses the Eureka Math Curriculum, which includes the following schedule for this unit:

| Grade Level Content Standards | Grade Level Content Standards |
| Number and operations | The student applies mathematical process standards to understand how to represent and compare whole numbers, the relative position and magnitude of whole numbers, and relationships within the numeration system related to place value. The student is expected to: | Number and operations | The student applies mathematical process standards to understand how to represent and compare whole numbers, the relative position and magnitude of whole numbers, and relationships within the numeration system related to place value.
