Read the following quote. Explain what it means in the context of the Code of Ethics for Texas teachers.
“Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have the right to do and what is right to do.”
– Potter Stewart
Responses may vary but may include:
Just because a teacher is allowed to do something by law doesn’t mean that it’s a good decision for them to make.
One of the standards in the Code of Ethics for Educators focuses on teachers having good morals. There are lots of things that people have the right to do that don’t show good morals.
It’s pretty easy to know some of the things teachers can’t do, like they can’t give drugs to their students. But there are lots of things that they have the right to do that still aren’t okay under the Code of Ethics for Educators.



Video: Parent-Teacher Relationship Scenario
The important facts in this scenario are:
Mr. Lowry is private about his personal life.
Ms. Keegan likes to know about teachers’ private lives.
Ms. Keegan observed Mr. Lowry having what seemed to be a personal conversation with a parent during parent-teacher conferences.
Ms. Keegan saw Mr. Lowry and the same parent interacting again at a different time.
Mr. Lowry first explained that the parent was concerned about her son, who is in his class.
However, the next day, he told Ms. Keegan that he has been dating the parent for about four months.
He and the parent didn’t realize that their son was in his class until their second date.
He hasn’t told anyone at school about their relationship.

Reflection: Guiding Questions
According to the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators, has Mr. Lowry behaved ethically?
The Code of Ethics for Texas Educators can be accessed by clicking on this link.
Mr. Lowry didn’t go anything specifically against the Code of Ethics because he is dating a parent, not a student. But the Code of Ethics does say that he should be of good moral character. There are lots of ways that this situation could hurt the student.

What could happen as a result of Mr. Lowry’s relationship with the student’s mother?
Responses may vary but may include:
The student could be embarrassed if others find out about his teacher’s relationship.
There is also a risk that Mr. Lowry could treat the student less fairly than his other students. If his relationship is going well, he might give the student better grades than he should get. If the relationship doesn’t go well, he might retaliate against the student.

What, if anything, should Mr. Lowry have done differently in this situation?
He should have spoken with an administrator at his school as soon as he realized that he was dating the mother of one of his students. There could be local policies about this situation and, even if there are not, the administrator can help Mr. Lowry make an ethical decision about what to do next.
