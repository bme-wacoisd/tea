Tips for Giving and Receiving Effective Feedback
Effective feedback can be powerful in helping to improve work with given and received effectively.
- Giving effective feedback:
- Feedback should meet 4 simple criteria:
- Specific:  Focus on one topic at a time and highlight specific examples from the work or presentation. Reference specific criteria from the project requirements as well.
- Actionable:  Focus on comments and suggestions about things that the person can change.
- Kind: Frame comments so they are respectful of the person and their work.
- Balance: Include comments about positive aspects of the work as well as comments about what can be improved. Positive comments can be equally useful to the recipient as comments pointing out areas for improvement.

- Receiving feedback:
- It is important to pay attention when receiving feedback. Insights offered can often provide helpful ideas to improve your work or presentation. Some key tips:
- Listen: Try to hear all the comments and suggestions being offered before responding
- Clarify: Ask clarifying questions about the feedback if there are comments that you don’t understand
- Accept: Resist the urge to be defensive. You do not have to agree with all the feedback that is offered. Try to focus on what will help improve your work rather than worrying about aspects of the feedback you disagree with.
