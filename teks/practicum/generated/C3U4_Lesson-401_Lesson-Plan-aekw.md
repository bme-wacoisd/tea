| 3 mins | Bellringer:  Read each of the statements below and decide whether you believe the statement to be true or false. Not every student can understand math. Some students are just “math people” and others are not. There are practices in mathematics that can lead to better student outcomes for all students. Understanding the process for how to solve a math problem is more important than understanding why that solution works. The U.S. scores above average on Math scores on international assessments such as the PISA (Program for International Assessment) exam. Memorizing math facts does not help students to learn math. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Research-Based Instructional Strategies T: Research-based instructional strategies are practices that were developed based on the best research available in the field of education and child psychology. They are a set of practices supported by research that should be present in classrooms, regardless of instructional materials. Today, we are going to call them RBIS. Sometimes this acronym is pronounced “Arby’s.”  Saying it that way might help you to remember them!  S: (Students record definition in Student Guide.)  T: RBIS are… A set of research-based practices that highlights misconceptions common in the field. Topics that require conceptual or philosophical shifts in approach to instruction. A set of practices that are supported by research and should be present in classrooms, regardless of instructional materials. A set of practices that relate directly to the design of instructional materials AND/OR the approach required to implement them well.  T: Why should we use research-based practices?  S: We want to ensure that the instructional practices we are using are going to work.   T: Research tells us that there are practices that can lead to better student outcomes. Students often categorize themselves as either good in math or not good at math. When teachers use RBIS, they help all students to recognize that they are capable at math regardless of grade level.  T: I am going to show you a graph of math achievement of US students compared to 7 countries with the largest economies in the world on an international assessment called the PISA test. (Display PISA chart on ppt.)  What do you notice about the math achievement of US students?   S: The US math score is the lowest of all the countries.  T: Turn to a partner and discuss the implications of the US having the lowest math scores compared to the 7 countries with the largest economies in the world. (Provide 2 minutes for discussion).  S: (Discuss with partner.)  T: What are some of the implications that you discussed?  S: (Responses may vary but could include: the US will not be able to compete for technology jobs or innovations, students will not be competitive in an increasingly global workforce, lack of skills/knowledge will require US to outsource jobs to other countries leading to less money in the US economy.)  T: So, with all these concerns you can see why it is especially important that we utilize the best, proven strategies to help our US students build their math skills for future success. | Student Guide PISA Scores Chart |
| 15 mins | Notes: Understanding of Procedural Fluency vs Conceptual Understanding   T: Let us look at content-specific practices for Math. We will look at each of these practices in more depth throughout this unit. (Share via PPT as students record descriptions in Student Guide.)  T: Just like you learned about making sure students are requiring complex-grade level texts and other content specific teaching strategies in the previous unit on RBIS Reading and Language Arts, this unit will outline three important strategies for math. The Content-specific practices for Math include: Balancing Conceptual Understanding with Procedural Fluency Requiring and encouraging productive struggle Providing curriculum embedded supports to accelerate student learning.  T: In today’s lesson, we will focus on the first strategy: Balancing conceptual understanding with procedural fluency. Look at the following image. (Share via PPT.)  T: When considering RBIS in math, rigor is a key characteristic. Rigor in math is made up of three components: Procedural skill and fluency, conceptual understanding, and application. Rigor is compared to a three-legged stool as show in the image. What happens to a stool such as the one shown if we were to remove one leg?  S: The stool would fall over or not stand.  T: To have rigor, you must have ALL three of those components. None is more important than the other. Now let us look at the difference between procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. I am going to show you a short video. As you watch, I want you to jot down some notes about how you might describe procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. (Show video.)  S: (Watch video and take notes in student guide.)  T: Now I want you to turn to a partner and share your thoughts about how you describe procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. See if you can come to an agreement about your descriptions. Also share any examples of procedural fluency or conceptual understanding that you might have observed in your field experiences. (Provide about 2 minutes for discussion.  S: (Engage in partner discussion.)  T: Can someone share how you and your partner described the terms?  S: (Share thinking with whole class.)  T: Could anyone identify an example of procedural fluency or conceptual understanding that they saw in their field experiences?  S: (Share field experience examples.)  T: Procedural fluency in math is defined as the ability to quickly perform mathematical calculations accurately. For students, this looks like a process or steps that they learn and engage in to solve similar problems.   T: Let us look at an example. (Display example of 1 ¾ ÷ ½)  T: In this example a student is asked to simplify this equation. If a teacher were helping students to build procedural fluency, they would describe the process to students as: First convert the 1 ¾ to the improper fraction of 7/4. Then multiply the numerators of 7 and 2 to get 14.  Then multiply the denominators of 4 and 1 to get 4. Convert the improper fraction of 14/4 to a mixed fraction of 3 ½.   T: Based on the description from the teacher above, how would you know that the teacher is helping students to build procedural fluency?  S: The teacher has given students a process and calculations to make to simplify the equation.  T: This is an example of procedural fluency because the teacher has provided steps and calculations and these steps and calculations could be repeated, practiced, and applied to solve similar problems in the future. It is all about being able to perform mathematical calculations quickly and accurately.  T: Now let us think about conceptual understanding. How did you describe conceptual understanding with your partner based on what you heard in the video?  S: (Share thinking and ideas.)  T: Conceptual understanding is the ability to access concepts from a number of perspectives and to see math as more than a set of mnemonics or discrete procedures. Conceptual understanding can be thought of as understanding why the math works the way that it does and how we can understand a problem in many different ways. So, let us go back to the equation we looked at previously. (Display example of 1 ¾ ÷ ½)   T: A teacher who is trying to help students to develop conceptual understanding may approach the problem a bit differently. Instead of asking students to simplify the equation, they might instead ask students to draw of picture that represents how many “halves” are in 1 ¾. To do that, students would need to understand that 1 would be the same as 4/4. They would need to draw 2 rectangles broken into four boxes each. They would then shade in 7 of the 8 boxes that represent 1 ¾ or 7/4. Since they would know that 2/4 is the same as ½, they could then think about 2 boxes together equaling 1 half. From there, the student would be able to recognize that for every two boxes it would equal one half, leading to an answer of 3 ½ halves in 1 ¾.  T: How is this approach different from the one that I provided for procedural fluency?  S: The second approach requires much more thinking. The student used a lot of different knowledge to solve the problem.  T: In the second approach, the student had to apply knowledge of fractions and how they were represented to solve the problem. This process might not look the same every time, meaning the student could not simply follow “steps” to solve the problem; they must understand how to visually represent the fractions in a meaningful way, which may look differently for different students. For instance, It would have been just as valid for a student to draw two circles and divide them into fours instead of rectangles, thinking of them as pizzas or pies that are divided or shared. All of these would display a conceptual understanding and get the student to the same final answer.  T: Why do you think it is important for students to build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency?  S: Students need to understand why they are doing what they are doing in math and be able to eventually do it fast with accuracy.  T: While developing procedural fluency can mean practicing similar types of problems over and over to ensure speed and accuracy, it is important that students also realize that solving problems often takes time, effort, and perseverance. | PPT Student Guide Video: Procedural Fluency and Conceptual Understanding (1:20) |
| 10 mins | Practice: Procedural Fluency or Conceptual Understanding? T: Now that you have a working understanding of the difference between procedural fluency and conceptual understanding, you will be working with a partner to examine some examples and see if you can correctly identify them as examples of procedural fluency or conceptual understanding. Please locate the examples in your student guide under Practice: Procedural Fluency or Conceptual Understanding?   S: (Locate examples).  T: (Assign student partners or ask students to work with shoulder partner.)  With your partner, look at each example and classify it as an example of procedural fluency or conceptual understanding. You will have 10 minutes to complete the activity. Are there any questions? S: (Students ask clarifying questions.)  T: You may begin. (Set timer for 10 minutes.)  S: (Complete practice activity.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Now I want you to turn to another partner group and compare your answers from the practice examples.  S: (Compare practice examples.)  T: How did you do? Are there any examples on which you did not agree?  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: (Clarify or respond to any questions that students may have on the examples.)  What is the difference between procedural fluency and conceptual understanding?  S: Procedural fluency focuses on the process or calculation and making sure that you can do them quickly and accurately. Conceptual understanding is all about helping students to understand why the math works the way it does.  T: Why is it important for teachers to use RBIS for math, such as balancing procedural fluency and conceptual understanding?  S: RBIS for math helps to improve student outcomes. Using RBIS also helps students in math to see that there is no such thing as a “math” person and that everyone can do math. | Student Guide |
