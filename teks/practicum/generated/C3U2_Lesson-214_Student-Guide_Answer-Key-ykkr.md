Notes: What is Burnout?




Video Viewing: What is Teacher Burnout?
Directions: You will watch a video called “Stress and Teacher Burnout” created by PBS. Answer the guided questions below.

1. What are some contextual factors that can cause stress to a teacher?

Demands of change or to fix something, improving test scores, implementing new curriculum, changes out of their control, community context or environmental factors, young peoples’ lives.

2. What is empathy distress or empathy fatigue in your own words? (Hint: Opposite of compassion and what too much empathy can do.)

When you are always feeling empathy for someone, you can get tired of it and get stuck in it. And it makes it hard to do other things. It is the opposite of compassion.

3. What is short-term stress? What is long-term stress?

Short-term stress is when you are overwhelmed with sadness or the lack of efficacy to do anything for a brief moment. Long-term stress is debilitating, and people lose the capacity to observe themselves. They may be objective with reality and see problems that don’t exist. Coping when you are stuck is very hard. People focus on the past and become angry and look to the future to “get out.”

4. How does burnout happen? Does it happen right away?

Burnout does not happen right away because it comes from long-term stress. It is a psychological and physiological state that can lead to depression.

5. Why are good teachers able to burnout?

Because all of the things that make someone a good teacher – juggling different tasks and being empathetic – are also the things that make people burnout.


Small Group Discussion: Teacher Burnout
Directions: Independently read the article, Teacher Burnout: Causes, Symptoms, and Prevention.
In small groups, using your notes, the article, and the teacher video, you will discuss the causes, symptoms and difficulties related to teacher burnout. The questions below are intended to be guiding questions for your conversation.
Norms:
Be respectful while others are speaking
Listen actively
Allow everyone the opportunity to speak
1. What is teacher burnout? How is it different than short-term stress?

Burnout is a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, detachment, and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment. This is a result of prolonged exposure to stress related to the job of an educator. It is different from short-term stress because short-term stress can happen only for a moment – like being sad for just a moment. Teacher burnout does not go away.

2. What are some stressors or contextual factors that can cause burnout? Why do you think these would cause burnout over a long period of time? (Hint: Video)

Political context, school environment, emotional stressors, working extra hours, etc. These could cause burnout over a long period of time because a long period of stress causes people to not be able to react and lose objective reality of what is going on.

3. What are the symptoms of burnout? Why is it important to recognize them?

Symptoms include physical response, depression, withdrawal, cynicism about the job. It is important to recognize them to prevent them.

4. Why should we prevent teacher burnout? How does teacher burnout affect students and the wider school?

We don’t want teacher to leave teaching because teachers who come into teaching love it. We also need teachers in the classroom. It affects students and the wider school because if teachers are feeling burn out, they are not teaching to the best of their ability and may stop caring about students. This could mean a lot of things for students.
