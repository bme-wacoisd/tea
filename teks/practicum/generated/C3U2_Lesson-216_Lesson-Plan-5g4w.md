| 5 mins | Bellringer:  “Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.”  -Vincent Van Gogh How does this quote relate or connect to developing a plan? Imagine a time where you were experiencing a lot of stress. What steps did you or could you have taken to minimize that stress? | Student Guide |
| 7 mins | Developing a Stress Management Plan  T: Who would like to share their response to the bell ringer?  S: Responses may vary but may include: The quote refers to a series of small things and with a plan we may break apart larger tasks into smaller actions. Small things brought together make something larger and a plan can be large or small.  T: Just like teachers create lesson plans to properly manage the tasks in the classroom, a stress management plan consists of simple, personalized strategies for decreasing stress and anxiety during stressful times or events.  T: All jobs, including those in education, are stressful at times. Having a plan can help them to manage these feelings before they have a greater effect on their work or life.  T: Why do you think it’s important to manage stress?  S: Answers will vary.  T: Managing stress impacts your overall happiness—both in your professional and personal life—and can make you feel more prepared to handle difficult situations when they do arise.  T: Let’s reflect on your teacher interviews. What did the teacher say that stood out to you?  S: Answers will vary Graphic Organizer T: Consider what we have already learned about stressors and the teaching profession.  As you reviewed your notes from your interview what similarities did you notice?  S: Students may refer to topics discussed earlier or examples from their interview:  working extra hours lack of balance in work-home life emotional stress lack of resources political context/climate classroom management difficulties administrative burdens  T: Find the Stress Management Plan Graphic Organizer--Example in your student guide. We’ll do the first one together. In the first example, Mr. Gutierrez is spending hours at home creating lesson plans. For him, this is a stressor. A stressor is an event or situation that causes stress or is perceived as a danger. What negative effects might this stressor have in Mr. Gutierrez’s life at work or at home?  S: Answers will vary but may include:  Mr. Gutierrez has less free time to spend with his family or friends. Mr. Gutierrez is tired when he gets to work. Mr. Gutierrez is experiencing stress because he does not have a “break.”  T: What are some ways that Mr. Gutierrez could have prevented this stressful situation?  S: Answers will vary but may include:   Mr. Gutierrez could talk to other math teachers about their planning strategies, and plan with those teachers. Mr. Gutierrez could talk to his principal and ask for suggestions to make planning more efficient. Mr. Gutierrez could create a lesson plan template with important information already filled out, so the lessons take less time to write.  T: When he does experience this stressful situation, what are some strategies Mr. Gutierrez could use to manage the stress? S: Answers will vary but may include:  Deep breathing techniques Mr. Gutierrez can dedicate a certain amount of time (example: 1 hour) that he is allowed to do work after he has come home. Setting a timer to take breaks after a certain amount of time working. Going for a walk after work with his family. Eating a healthy dinner away from his computer/work. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Independent Planning  T: Look back through your notes and take note of three stressors mentioned by the teacher you interviewed. In the blank graphic organizer in your Student Guide, identify the negative response caused by each stressor. What strategies would you suggest they use for preventing and managing stress?  S: (Fill out the graphic organizer.) | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Group Planning T: (Use your classroom routine to create partner groups.) T: In your partner groups, you are going to create a stress management plan that you will present to the class. You can use the strategies you brainstormed in your graphic organizer to help create your plan and presentation.  T: Your stress management plan should include the following:    3 Stressors teachers may experience Strategies to prevent the stressor A plan for managing the stressor when it does arise T: You’ll present your stress management plan in a slideshow. In your Student Guide, you’ll find a rubric for scoring the plan and presentation. You will have fifteen minutes today and ten minutes tomorrow to complete your plan and prepare for your presentation. S: (Work in partners to develop their stress management plan and presentation.) | Student Guide Computer |
| 3 mins | Debrief  T: What challenges did you encounter when creating your plan with your partner?  S: Answers will vary. T: What do you need to make sure you do tomorrow during your planning time? S: Answers will vary. | Student Guide |
