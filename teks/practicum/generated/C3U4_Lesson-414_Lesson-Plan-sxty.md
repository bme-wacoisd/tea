|  | In advance of this lesson: Prior to this lesson, students should have pulled and organized their portfolio items identified throughout the unit. This task should have been completed for homework from the previous lesson. However, time can be built into this lesson during Portfolio Presentations Planning to locate and/or order these.  Invite others, such as field site teachers, administrators, counselors, etc., to attend student presentations and provide feedback.  Make enough copies of the portfolio presentation feedback form (in the Student Guide) for each student and guest to complete one form for each presentation they observe. Plan for how much time you will need for all students to present – as this lesson can stretch over multiple lessons if necessary. |  |

Let us thank our guests with a round of applause.  S: (Applaud.)  T: During your presentation, there are several important pieces of information you need to share. First, state your name for our guests. Then, tell us about your goal for your career in education and training.  T: After that, you will display each component of the portfolio on the screen, one by one. You will not be reading any of the portfolio components to us. Instead, while the portfolio component is on the screen, share the two most important things you learned while developing that part of the portfolio. Once you have finished sharing one element of the portfolio, move on to the next one.  T: (Display slide with portfolio presentation outline.)  T: You should present the items in your portfolio in the order in which you organized them for homework.  T: There is a presentation planner in your Student Guide.
