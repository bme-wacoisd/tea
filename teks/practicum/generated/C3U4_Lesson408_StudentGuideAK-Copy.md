Bellringer:
How do I meet the different needs of my students AND teach the grade-level TEKS as they are intended?
Responses may vary but may include:
Utilizing flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences through engagement, representation, and expression.

Notes: UDL in Math


Practice 1: Guided Example
A 6th grade math class is working on the following TEKS:
6.4(B) Apply qualitative and quantitative reasoning to solve prediction and comparison of real-world problems involving ratios, rates, and proportions.
The teacher gives her students the following word problem: Jay was paid $190 for a job that required 40 hours of work. At this rate, how much should he be paid for a job requiring 60 hours of work?
Many of her students were successfully able to complete the word problem, but one student has unfinished learning as he has a hard time operating with fractions.
What should the teacher do?
To support this student as well as all the students in the class through multiple means of engagement, the teacher might provide students with coping skills when they get frustrated, use prompts and scaffolds to help support students through the steps of the word problem, provide specific and timely feedback, and provide real-world examples that are relevant to the students’ life.
To support students through multiple means of representation, the teacher may give students a variety of different ratios and proportions in word problems. The teacher may show worked examples on the board, model with drawings, or use a demonstration, such as making a recipe for the class.
To support students through multiple means of representation, the teacher may give students multiple ways to demonstrate they understand word problems using ratios and proportions, such as worked problems, explained answers, demonstrations, video explanation, etc.
Which approach do you think will most likely increase student understanding and promote more accessible outcomes for all students?
The UDL approach because all students are held to high expectations and given access and support with grade-level content.


Practice 2: Video Analysis
Watch a video example of a 1st grade math lesson to see how UDL is used throughout the lesson. As you watch, take notes on the different ways you see UDL practices being used to support student learning.

How did the UDL strategies named in the video compare to the UDL strategies you listed?
Responses will vary.
Are there other UDL strategies you would have used to make this lesson accessible to all students?
Responses will vary.
How could technology have been used to enhance the lesson?
Students could have completed learning activities on the computer that were personalized to their learning. Students could have used online manipulatives, students could have watched videos, etc.


Practice 3: Scenarios
Read each scenario. With your group, determine what the long-term impact for the student might be and what a UDL approach to this situation might look like.




| Unfinished Learning | Knowledge or skills in the TEKS that students have not yet mastered |
| --- | --- |
| Traditional Approach | The teacher modifies lessons for some learners so that they can address unfinished learning, such as giving them different problems than other students. |
| Universal Design for Learning (UDL) | An educational framework to guide the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences through engagement, representation, and expression. UDL minimizes barriers and maximizes learning for all students |
| UDL Guidelines | A set of strategies that can be applied to any subject or grade level to ensure that all learners can access and participate in meaningful, challenging learning opportunities |


| Segment | UDL Strategies in the Lesson | UDL Strategies I Would Add |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Modeling, clear instructions, gradual release, feedback from students after the model, whiteboard | Responses will vary. |
| 2 | Manipulatives, visuals, vocabulary/math language, multiple representations, small groups | Responses will vary. |


| Scenario | Long-term Impact | What Might a UDL Approach Look Like? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Students in Mr. P’s 5th grade math class were given the following problem to solve.  A restaurant bill was paid equally by 7 friends. The bill was $99.96. How much money in dollars and cents did each person pay?  (STAAR End-of-Grade Assessment in Grade 5 Mathematics, 2022 Released Form).  Most of the students were able to complete the problem with ease, but one student really struggled with decimals. The teacher decided to modify the numbers in the word problem so that the student would only have to solve the problem using whole numbers instead of decimals. | The student is going to continue to fall further behind and is not going to be prepared for the End-of-Grade Assessment. | Responses will vary but may include: the teacher could model examples on the board, use models with drawings, use a demonstration with actual money, provide step-by-step directions for the student to access at his desk.   Opposed to giving the student simplified numbers, the teacher could provide supports and scaffolds to allow the student to access the same grade-level content. |
| Ms. M is teaching a lesson on subtraction using a number line. She talks to students about what a number line is, shows an example of a number line, and then shows a video about how to subtract using a number line. After the video, she gives her students a few problems to solve. | Students may have difficulty understanding how to subtract on a number line because Ms. M did not model for students or practice any problems with them before asking students to complete the problems on their own. Students will likely have unfinished learning. | Responses will vary but could include: the teacher could model examples on the board, used a demonstration such as a human number line where students represented numbers on the number line, provided step-by-step instructions for students, had students help complete problems on the board, etc. |
| Ms. K’s 5th grade class has been learning about ecosystems to answer the question: how can trees support so much life? Students build an understanding of how energy flows in food webs by engaging in different activities, labs, and research to explore life surrounding and supported by a mangrove tree. Now, Ms. K wants to assess her students understanding by giving everyone a unit assessment. | All students may not be able to demonstrate a complete understanding of their learning through a single paper/pencil assessment; therefore, the teacher may assume they do not have a deep knowledge of the content. | Responses will vary but could include: provide students will the opportunity to showcase their learning through an authentic project or representation. Allow students to choose how they want to demonstrate their learning. |
