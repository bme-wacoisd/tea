### Lesson 4.12: Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:
Mark the following as true or false.

_______ Teachers must balance procedural and conceptual math instruction to build greater understanding of math concepts.

_______ If students cannot perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division from memory, they cannot be successful with more advanced math concepts.

_______ When students do not understand a lesson, it is best to reteach that lesson the next day to give students more “at-bats.”

_______ The most effective math interventions tie review of foundational skills into grade-level content.



Instruction: Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction Notes
Practice: Identifying Strategies to Overcome Instructional Pitfalls
With a partner, consider the following scenarios related to each pitfall. Identify which pitfall is at play and, using the prior knowledge developed throughout this unit, suggest an alternative approach for that teacher and explain why it is important for them to take a different approach.

Consider the intervention you are planning within your internship class. What pitfall are you most concerned about falling into with your planning? Why?










How might you address this pitfall?




| Pitfall | Description | Challenges it Presents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Too much Remediation |  |  |
| Procedural Instruction |  |  |
| Prioritizing Fluency Practice |  |  |
| Repeating the First Teach |  |  |


| Example | Pitfall | Alternative (With Rationale) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ms. A’s students are struggling to quickly and accurately complete multi-step equations because they do not have their multiplication and division facts memorized. She decides to dedicate in-class time for students to just practice memorizing multiplication and division every day for the next two weeks. |  |  |
| Ms. L decided to focus on teaching her students step-by-step instructions for subtracting two- and three-digit numbers because that is how she learned, and it is faster than the way her curriculum explains the concept. |  |  |
| When Ms. Q’s students did not master her lesson on multiplying fractions, she decided to use the same lesson the next day (with switching out the numbers in the practice problems) and teach it again. |  |  |
| Based on pre-test data, Mr. E. noticed that his class has not mastered the third grade TEKS necessary to succeed in his next unit, so he decides to cover those standards before he moves to grade level content. |  |  |
