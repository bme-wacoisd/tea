### Lesson 4.10: Remediating, Accelerating, and Just-in-Time Supports

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:
John entered the second grade without having mastered all the first-grade math content standards. His second-grade teacher, noticing this same challenge for many students, spent much of the first few months providing remediation around first grade content before moving onto second grade math concepts. John was able to learn some of these first-grade concepts, but his teacher had to move quickly to address nearly 1.5 years of content in one school year. Unfortunately, he finished second grade with gaps in both first and second grade content.
Now he is entering third grade and his teacher saw similar challenges for many students in a pre-assessment to start the school year. What will happen if his third-grade teacher begins the year the same way his second-grade teacher did? Why?


Instruction 1: Acceleration and Just-in-Time Supports Notes













Contrasting Remediation and Acceleration
Instruction 2: Just-in-time Interventions Notes
Ms. C. is a second-grade teacher using just-in time interventions to help her students catch up on prior skills while still engaging in grade-level content. Examine the table below to determine how she can use acceleration while keeping students on-grade level.

How is Ms. C being strategic with planning her just-in-time interventions?




How is Ms. C being timely with these just-in-time interventions?





Practice: Identifying Remediation vs Acceleration
Scenario 1: Mr. M and Ms. G both teach 8th grade math. As part of their professional learning community (PLC) they use common assessments to measure their student’s understanding of the 8th grade TEKS. Therefore, they can compare their results to determine what teaching practices are most effective.
Ms. G used her pre-test data to identify the foundational math skills that students have not yet mastered and has designed a four-week “math bootcamp” at the beginning of the school year help students catch up on the concepts they need to succeed in the 8th grade curriculum.
Mr. M used his pre-test data to identify the areas where his students have gaps in foundational content knowledge and has designed small group interventions for select students the week prior to introducing a new concept. He addresses these skills with the students that need it most, making direct connections to the grade level content they will learn the following week.

Which teacher is using acceleration? Which is using remediation?







What do you think they will see in their common assessment data (And the 8th grade STAAR test) when they compare their results?





Scenario 2: Ms. V and Ms. P both teach 4th grade math. Below are their students’ results on this year’s STAAR test, broken down by Unit.

Which teacher is using acceleration? Which is using remediation? How do you know?
