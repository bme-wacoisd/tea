Date:
Objectives:
- Observe and reflect on the uses of other formative assessment strategies.
- Practice and apply appropriate formative assessment strategies.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is to align connections between various formative assessments and student learning experiences using field notes, practice, and reflection.
Summary: This tool requests that students arrange to observe a teacher’s use of a gallery walk, graphic organizer, learning logs, or ABCD cards and make field notes about what participating students are doing. Next, students are invited to work with their field site campus teachers to design an appropriate gallery walk or graphic organizer, which may be used during instruction at the teacher’s discretion. Lastly, students are asked to interpret the value of these formative assessment strategies through both the eyes of the participating students and through the eyes of the teacher.
