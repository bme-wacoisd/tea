## Slide 3

### Bellringer

- Mark the following as true or false.
- _______ Teachers must balance procedural and conceptual math instruction to build greater understanding of math concepts.
- _______ If students can’t perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division from memory, they cannot be successful with more advanced math concepts.
- _______ When students don’t understand a lesson, it is best to reteach that lesson the next day to give students more “at-bats.”
- _______ The most effective math interventions tie review of foundational skills into grade-level content.

### Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction Notes pg.1


| Pitfall | Description | Challenge it Presents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Too much Remediation | Prioritizing below grade-level content | Prevents students from accessing grade-level content and may lead students to have a negative association with Math. |

## Slide 5

### Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction Notes pg. 2


| Pitfall | Description | Challenge it Presents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Procedural Instruction | Focusing on procedures to speed up instruction. | When students only have procedural knowledge of math concepts, they lack a true understanding of WHY these procedures work, limiting their ability to apply this knowledge in different contexts. |


| If students have a procedural understanding of subtraction, they know that you can borrow from the tens place when subtracting from two-digit numbers:  1   15 25 - 8 17 | BUT without a conceptual understanding of subtraction, they may struggle to know what to do when they are introduced to problem where borrowing does not work  0    13 13 - 8 ? |

### Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction Notes p. 3


| Pitfall | Description | Challenge it Presents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prioritizing Fluency Practice | Focusing on student understanding of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division at the expense of grade level content. | Pulls students away from deeper conceptual knowledge and grade-level content. |

### Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction Notes p. 4


| Pitfall | Description | Challenge it Presents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repeating the First Teach | Reteaching content the same way again to provide more “at-bats.” | Does not directly address student misconceptions and does not allow for multiple methods of engagement. |

## Slide 8

### Practice: Identifying Strategies to Overcome Instructional Pitfalls: Ms. A Scenario

- 8
- Ms. A’s students are struggling to quickly and accurately complete multi-step equations because they don’t have their multiplication and division facts memorized. She decides to dedicate in-class time for students to just practice memorizing multiplication and division every day for the next two weeks.

---

## Slide 9

### Practice: Identifying Strategies to Overcome Instructional Pitfalls: Ms. L Scenario

- 9
- Ms. L decided to focus on teaching her students step-by-step instructions for subtracting two- and three-digit numbers because that is how she learned, and it is faster than the way her curriculum explains the concept.

---

## Slide 10

### Practice: Identifying Strategies to Overcome Instructional Pitfalls: Ms. Q Scenario

- 10
- When Ms. Q’s students did not master her lesson on multiplying fractions, she decided to use the same lesson the next day (with switching out the numbers in the practice problems) and teach it again.

---

## Slide 11

### Practice: Identifying Strategies to Overcome Instructional Pitfalls: Mr. E. Scenario

- 11
- Based on pre-test data, Mr. E noticed that his class has not mastered the third grade TEKS necessary to succeed in his next unit, so he decides to cover those standards before he moves to grade level content.

---

## Slide 12

### Practice: Identifying Strategies to Overcome Instructional Pitfalls

- 12
- Consider the intervention you are planning within your internship class. What pitfall are you most concerned about falling into with your planning? Why?
- How might you address this pitfall?

## Slide 13

### Exit Ticket


| ____ | Too Much Remediation | “Students did not quite master the previous lesson. If I reteach that lesson and provide more at-bats, students will achieve mastery and then we can move on." |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ____ | Procedural Instruction | “I can’t teach this third-grade lesson until I know my students have mastered all of the second-grade content.” |
| ____ | Prioritizing Fluency Practice | Students don’t know their math facts yet, so they’re not ready for this grade-level instruction. We need to get caught up on math facts so we can prevent mistakes and get to grade level content. |
| ____ | Repeating the First Teach | I don’t have enough time to teach conceptually. I need to model the quickest, easiest way to complete the problem so we can get through the content. |

- Select one of the teacher comments from the table above and explain why the pitfall they are expressing can negative impact student success. Then, provide an alternative for how they can still address these needs while providing grade-level instruction.
