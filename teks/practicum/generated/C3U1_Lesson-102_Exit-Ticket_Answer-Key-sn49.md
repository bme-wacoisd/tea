Name:
Date:
For each scenario, determine whether the federal or state government should respond and why.
Scenario 1:
Employers in a certain region of the country report that they need employees who have skills in cybersecurity, and they recommend that courses in cybersecurity should be created and offered as part of Career and Technical Education programs.

The state government should respond because establishing and maintaining academic content standards is a state responsibility.

Scenario 2:
Members of Congress have reviewed research showing that students learn foreign languages more quickly when they learn them in elementary school (rather than middle school or high school). They have identified funding for elementary schools that want to start foreign language programs.

The federal government should respond because the funding is from the federal government and used to support schools following specific guidelines.
