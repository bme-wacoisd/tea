| Diagnostic  Formative  Summative  Interim | Assessment used at the end of a learning sequence to determine to what extent students met the learning objectives; evaluative.   Assessment used at different checkpoints throughout the year to measure student understanding of a broader span of student expectations and learning targets to monitor progress, predict summative performance, and identify students for intervention.   Assessments are used to determine student progress while learning is still happening (during a learning sequence) and to inform the next steps in a learning progression.  Assessments are used to collect information about a student’s strengths and weaknesses in a particular skill area and are usually given at the beginning of a new unit. |
