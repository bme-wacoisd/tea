### Lesson 2.11: Using Ethics to Guide Decision-Making, Part 2

Name:
Date:
Respond to the questions below about the following ethical scenario:
Mr. Carlos is a veteran teacher who is popular with his students. He often offers extra help after school. Mr. Carlos is tutoring one of his students, Thomas after school currently. Thomas has been a student in several of Mr. Carlos’s classes over the last two years. During this time Mr. Carlos has emailed and texted Thomas’ cellphone using his personal number and email address. At first the exchanges were very general and focused on school-related topics such as progress in class and participation on sports teams. Lately, Thomas has started to text Mr. Carlos more about his personal life and feelings.
- Is Mr. Carlos acting in an ethical manner based on the Code of Ethics for Texas teachers? Why or why not?
No, he is not acting in an ethical manner. Communications between students occur through school-approved accounts, about school-related topics.

- What are some of the potential negative consequences for the teachers or students?
Conversations over text or personal email can be forwarded or taken out of context, looking inappropriate. Also, Mr. Carlos may not have the skills or knowledge to deal with Thomas’ personal feelings and issues. This could lead to bad advice or inappropriate actions on both sides.
