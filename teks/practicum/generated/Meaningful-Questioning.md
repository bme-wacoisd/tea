# Meaningful-Questioning


## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Meaningful Questioning

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
Analyze how meaningful questions lead to cognitive engagement.
- Use questioning strategies to cognitively engage students and require effortful thinking.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students  to observe higher-order questioning  .
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the use of meaningful questions, such as Directive and Non-Directive Prompts, can lead to cognitive engagement. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students practice planning and/or implementing an instructional activity.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 4.10:  Meaningful Questioning for Cognitive Engagement, Part I
Lesson 4.11:  Meaningful Questioning for Cognitive Engagement, Part II
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 4: The student understands the learner and the learning process. The student is expected to: (A) relate and implement principles and theories of human development to teaching and training situations; (B) relate and implement principles and theories about the learning process to teaching and training situations; (C) demonstrate and implement behaviors and skills that facilitate learning.
- Standard 5:  The student interacts effectively in the role of an educator. The student is expected to: (A) demonstrate effective interaction skills with stakeholders such as students, educators, parents/guardians, community members, and other professionals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

Reflect:


| Higher-order questioning | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| How does the teacher reward a “right” answer with a more challenging |  |
| How does the teacher use non-directive prompts, such as “Say more.”? |  |
| What higher-order thinking questions (Why, how, what if) did you observe the teacher asking? |  |


| Discuss with the field site campus teacher: | Discuss with the field site campus teacher: |

| How they use questioning strategies to scaffold learning engage students? |  |
| How they use questioning strategies to challenge students and engage them in higher-level thinking? |  |
| How they use prompts like “say more” or “develop that idea” to guide students to think further in a specific way? |  |

| Design and/or implement an instructional activity that intentionally incorporates the Stretch It technique to create meaningful questions, as Directive and/or Non-Directive Prompts that lead to cognitive engagement. Consider using the suggested prompts below as a guide.  It is encouraged that the student uses the curriculum already used by the field site teacher, and it is not the expectation that the student makes it up themself. |  |
| Date & Time: |  |
| Class / Subject: |  |
| Directive Prompts | Non-Directive Prompts |
| Ask How or Why | Say More |
| Ask for Another Way to Reach the Same Answer | Keep Going |
| Ask for More Precise Expression | Develop That |
| Ask for Evidence | Head Nod, Raised Eyebrow, of a “Keep Going” hand gesture |
| Ask for Integration of a Related Skill | Build on it Please |
