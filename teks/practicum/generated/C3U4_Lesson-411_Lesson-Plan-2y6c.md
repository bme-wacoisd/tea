|  | This lesson references the portfolio project introduced in lesson 4.10. In the sections where students must reference the plans for a math intervention within their internship class, students who are not in a class where math is an option should use the Sample Math Intervention Scenario found in 4.10. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Ms. L teaches Algebra 1. This week, she is introducing the slope-intercept form linear equation: y = mx + b. She feels confident that her students will be able to understand the terms and graph examples but is concerned that a few of her students have struggled to solve for an unknown variable in an equation. Once students need to solve for x, some of them will not be able to complete the assignment. She decides to provide a targeted review of how to solve for unknown variables in an equation during her school’s study hall block the day before the lesson and asks the students who have the most difficulty on this topic attend. By providing this support, nearly 90 percent of her students were proficient on her exit ticket the following day.  1. Describe how Ms. L set her students up for success using the terms “acceleration” and “just-in-time interventions.” | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Notes: Just-in-time Interventions  T: As you have learned in this unit, math is one of the most common subject areas where students will struggle because of missing previous grade-level concepts or skills. You have learned about remediation, acceleration, and just-in-time interventions. Who can explain how the bellringer shows an example of a teacher using a just-in-time intervention? S: Ms. L saw that her students needed review, so she decided to use acceleration, instead of remediation, to help them catch up while still teaching them grade-level content. She provided a just-in-time intervention to help her students review how to solve for a missing variable so that they could better understand how to use the slope intercept linear equation. T: Today, we will focus on just-in-time interventions for acceleration, like what Ms. L did, and the three steps teachers use to design and implement these interventions. Can someone remind us of the definition of a just-in-time intervention? S: A strategic and timely review or reteaching of foundational skills that contribute to success on grade-level content. T: Exactly. Why is it important to provide just-in-time interventions instead of simply reviewing all needed content at the beginning of the school year?  S: Traditional remediation doesn’t allow students to connect the review with grade level content. It also increases the chances that students won’t get to all their grade level content that year because the teacher dedicates lots of time to reviewing the last year’s content.  T: There are three major steps to just-in-time interventions. Please find the section of your student guide entitled Planning Effective Just-In-Time Interventions Notes. S: (Locate table in student guide.) T: Follow along with the PowerPoint and complete the descriptions of each in your student guide. First, teachers must Identify Prerequisite Skills and Knowledge. This is where teacher examines a unit’s standards and objectives and use an aligned pre-test to identify the prior knowledge needed to master grade level content. Why is it important to both analyze the standards and provide a pre-test? S: Because the teacher needs to think in advance about what students need to know and then have a data point to show which students need the intervention.  T: It is most effective when it is an assessment that occurs in class, but teachers can also use STAAR data from the previous year to get an idea of which concepts definitely need to be revisited. T: Next is Scheduling with the Scope and Sequence. A just-in-time intervention needs to be provided at a time that aligns with the grade-level content it supports. The best way to figure out this timing is to look at the unit plan or scope and sequence, which outlines the objectives and topics of the lessons. So, a teacher should identify timely opportunities to provide just-in-time interventions within the scope and sequence.  T: Third, the teacher must Design and Implement Appropriate Interventions. The activities should make clear connections between the skills and the grade-level content. Often, high-quality instructional materials have such materials available as part of their curriculum. T: Are there any clarifying questions about these steps? S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: (Answer any clarifying questions.) | Student Guide PPT |
| 15 mins | Practice 1: Applying the Steps of Just-in-Time Interventions for Acceleration T: To help us better understand how these steps work in practice, let’s examine a specific teacher scenario. Please locate “Practice 1: Applying the Steps of Just-in-Time Interventions for Acceleration.” in your student guide. Can someone read the description aloud for us? S: (Reads the description) T: Our first step is Identifying the prerequisite skills and knowledge. Can someone remind us of the two ways teachers identify these skills? S: By looking at a unit’s standards and objectives and a pre-test. T: Can someone read the description for Mr. H’s approach to Step 1 aloud? S: (Reads the description) T: So, this unit is discussing addition and subtraction of unit lengths. Follow along with me as we examine these content standards. Mr. H’s curriculum has included standards for second grade, here called the Grade Level Content Standards, and the first-grade standards they build on, here called foundational standards. You will notice that the second-grade standards start with a 2, while the first-grade standards start with a 1. T: This unit focuses on geometry and measurement and by the end, students will apply mathematical process standards to select and use units to describe length, area, and time. (Read each standard, pointing out the term units of length, which means anything from inches to paper clips that is used to determine the length of an object.)  T: Without reading the first-grade standards, what do you think students need to know in order to master these standards? S: What units are. How to measure things with a ruler. How to use units to measure objects. What a number line is. Addition and Subtraction. T: Take a moment to independently read the foundational standards that tie to these second-grade standards. Are there prerequisite skills or knowledge needed that you didn’t think about? S: (Responses will vary) T: Take four minutes to respond to questions 1 and 2. S: (Respond to questions 1 and 2.) T: Since we already discussed question one as a group, who can share their thoughts on question 2?  S: If they do not understand that you can measure an object using units, they may not understand how to use inches or centimeters as standard units of measurement to find the length of an object. T: Mr. H also uses a pre-test to determine which of these competencies’ students need support with. There are two questions here, and the results below. Can someone read those results aloud? S: (Read Results aloud.) T: Take a minute and jot down a response to question 3. Given the results of this assessment, what concept should Mr. H focus on with his just-in-time intervention? How many students should be in this intervention group? S: (Respond to Question 3) T: Who can share their response? (Push students to reference the standard around which students lack mastery.) S: Some students need support in standard 1.7B and 1.7D, how to use same sized units to units to measure objects using units and describe a length using the nearest whole unit. Six students should be in the intervention group for this concept. T: Next is step 2, scheduling within the Scope and Sequence. Mr. H. uses the Eureka Math curriculum provided by his district. These high-quality instructional materials provide the following overview of the topics and objectives featured in this upcoming unit.  T: The first thing I notice is that lessons are grouped by the TEKS they cover. Each lesson also includes a specific topic that gives a bit more insight into the content. I remember from our first step that standards 2.9A, 2.9B, and 2.9C are the three grade level standards we want students to engage. When we are planning a just-in-time intervention, they can come anywhere within a unit, but we should ensure that it comes immediately before students need those skills. Take one minute and turn and talk with a partner to discuss which point in the unit (A, B, or C) should Mr. H provide this intervention and why. S: (Turn and Talk, writing the response to question 4 in their student guide.) T: Can a group share out? S: Mr. H should provide this intervention at point A. The first objective requires students to use multiple copies of the same unit to measure objects, so he should provide this intervention prior to this lesson. B and C are too late. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Step 3: Design and Implement the Intervention  T: Tale the next 8 minutes to read Mr. H’s approach to step three, Designing and implementing the appropriate interventions. Then Answer questions 5 and 6.  S: (Complete the Step 3 section in the student guide.)   T: To effectively create an intervention, a teacher must first think about what the grade level content is and how these foundational standards tie in. Who can share their response to question 5?  S: To succeed in this content, students must be able to use a ruler and a paper clip to measure the ribbons. They are using two different units of measurement to compare lengths of ribbons. For students to understand this, they must understand how units can be used to measure things (centimeters vs paperclips.)  T: Next the teacher needs to use problems that align in a way that supports students in mastering the grade level content. Which of the three options do you think best helps students access the grade level content shown in the unit assessment question?  S: Question C, because it is the only one that uses units to measure the length of something. This is a skill students must master in order to know how to use paper clips or a ruler to measure the ribbon in the above question. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: This three-step process is something you will need to complete as part of the portfolio assignment we introduced last class. With support from your cooperating teacher, you should gather the information for step one, schedule a time as step two, and discuss what sorts of information you should include in the intervention with students. (If students do not have a math class for which to plan this portfolio assignment, provide them with the handout attached to lesson 4.10.) |  |
