| 5 mins | Bellringer:  “Being a professional is doing the things you love to do on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” -Julius Erving, American Basketball Player What is an example of a time you did not feel like doing something you enjoyed, but did so anyway because it was the right thing? How does this quote relate to the teaching profession? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Peer Feedback on Introduction Speech T: Before we begin our speeches today, I am going to give you ten minutes to practice with a partner and receive feedback from them. You will deliver your speech just as you would for the class. In the Student Guide, your partner will document warm and cool feedback based on the rubric in the Student Guide, which they will share with you. Once you have completed your speech and received feedback, you will switch roles with your partner.  T: Please turn to your presentation rubric in your student guide. This is the criteria for which you will be graded, and with which your partner will give you feedback.   T: Someone read the first rubric category for us.   S: Creating a warm & welcoming environment  T: Right, so we want to make sure our message delivery, tone, facial expressions, and words make students feel welcome, safe, and eager to learn.  T: Someone else read the second rubric category.  S: Share expectations for the class  T: We need to make sure students clearly know what our expectations are from them, as well as what they can expect from the class.  T: Someone read the third rubric category.  S: Share information about yourself as a teacher.   T: Your students are eager to know about their teacher. Feel free to share information about you as a teacher that is appropriate. This is the start of the relationship you’re building with your students.  T: What is the last criteria for this activity?  S: Professional dress and behavior.   T: Correct, so that means you are following our class protocol by not being out of compliance with dress code and you are composing yourself as a professional when giving your introduction speech.  T: Are there any questions before we rehearse?  S: (Ask questions, if any.)  T: (Use your classroom routines to assign partners.)  S: (Practice their introduction speech/provide feedback.) | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Introduction Speech Presentations S: (Individually, give their First Day of School Introduction Speech to the class. Students in the audience will provide warm and cool feedback based on the rubric in the Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Why is it important for a teacher to start the first day of school with an introductory speech like the ones we modeled today? S: Answers will vary, but may include: To help the students get to know the teacher, to establish classroom expectations/rules, to clarify learning targets/objectives, to create a welcoming learning environment, etc. T: How a teacher communicates with their students, colleagues, administrators, and parents is an incredibly important part of the teaching profession. Why is it important to have clear, professional communication?  S: Answers will vary, but may include: to prevent or disengage conflict, increase confidence in the teacher, help students and parents to feel supported in the learning environment, establish routines and procedures, etc.  T: What questions do you still have about professional communication?  S: ({Write actions that students need to take.}) | Student Guide |
