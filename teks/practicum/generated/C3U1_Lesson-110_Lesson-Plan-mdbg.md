| Rationale/ Summary | In this lesson, students will consider factors that contribute to these shortages. Teacher shortages are an increasing and complex problem in schools across the state and nation. While teacher shortages harm students, teachers, and the educational system, there are greater effects in areas that are disproportionally difficult to staff. | In this lesson, students will consider factors that contribute to these shortages.

| 2 mins | Bellringer A teacher shortage exists in education. There are some areas identified as hard to staff such as special education, math, and science classrooms. Why might it be more difficult to fill these positions? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share your response. If you are in an even row, your partner is the person in front of you.   S: (Turn and talk.)  T:  What are some of the reasons it is more difficult to fill these positions?   S: Answers may vary but may include: It is harder to get licensed as a special education teacher.  Not too many people want to teach math because it is hard.  You can make more money as a scientist than a science teacher.  There are different requirements for these teachers, so it is harder to get your degree. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Discussion and Notes: Supply and Demand  T: The teacher shortage exists in almost every district in the nation. A teacher shortage occurs when there are not enough teachers to staff open positions. This means that the supply and demand for teachers is not equal. Supply and demand refer to the number of teachers available and qualified for positions compared to the number of available positions. We learned that districts are working to address the shortage by creating Grow Your Own Programs, recruiting retired teachers back to the field, and increasing salaries or offering bonuses.   T: What has been the impact of these efforts?   S: We continue to have teacher shortages.   T: It is never enough to just address the symptoms of the problem. We must also address the causes of teacher shortages.   T: Previously, we reviewed that not only is there a teacher shortage, but there are also areas that are considered hard-to-staff. Hard-to -staff areas are teaching categories (such as special education, bilingual education, mathematics, or science) in which there is an indication of multi-year data to indicate a teacher shortage in the area. Additionally, these shortages and hard-to staff areas show up disproportionally in some areas’ schools and districts. Disproportionality refers to unequal or out of proportion. This means that even though most districts have large number of vacancies or hard-to-staff positions, there are some districts in which the number of vacancies and hard to staff positions far exceeds what it should when compared to other districts.   S: (Add notes to chart in Student Guide.)  T: For the bellringer, you were asked to reflect on and share why it might be more difficult to fill hard-to-staff positions such as special education, math, and science teaching positions. Please share some of those reasons with the class.  S: Answers may vary but may include: It is harder to get licensed as a special education teacher.  Not too many people want to teach math because it is hard.  You can make more money as a scientist than a science teacher.  There are different requirements for these teachers and, and it is harder to get your degree. | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Practice: Researching Teacher Retention and Disproportionality   T: The teacher shortage issue will not be solved by simply recruiting new teachers to the field of education. Understanding that it is not enough to simply recruit new teachers to the field of education, we will research current teacher retention efforts and analyze the causes of hard-to-staff teaching areas. Teacher retention refers to the number of teachers who remain in the classroom over time. Additionally, disproportionality with the number of teacher vacancies exists not only in specific hard to staff areas, but also in specific schools and districts. This is what makes the issue of teacher retention so critical.   T: As a part of your research, you will answer the following questions:  What are the factors that cause hard-to-staff and teacher shortages? Are there specific schools and/or types of schools that experience these shortages more so than others?  What are districts doing to increase teacher retention?  What do you believe is the likely impact of the teacher shortage on student learning?   T: In same pairs as the bellringer discussion, conduct research using the websites listed in the Student Guide and complete the graphic organizer that you will find there as well. You will have 18 minutes to conduct your research.  T: (Sets a timer)    S: (Record responses in Student Guide.)  Researching Teacher Retention and Disproportionality Research | Student Guide |
| 3 min | Debrief  T: Let us take a few minutes to review your research.   T:  What are the factors that cause hard-to-staff and teacher shortages?  S: Working conditions is one reason for a teacher shortage. There are not enough people entering the field because they are dissatisfied with teacher pay, respect given to teachers, and the workload.   T: Were there specific schools or school types that have greater teacher shortages than others?   S: Urban areas and rural areas had more vacancies than suburban area. Also, schools with higher poverty rates had greater disproportionality than more affluent districts.   T: What did you find as to why urban, rural, and high poverty schools had more vacancies?   S: The retention rates for these schools were lower, and teachers were less likely to work at these schools for longer periods of time.   T: What are districts doing to increase teacher retention?  S: Some districts are offering bonuses; others are trying to improve the working conditions for teachers.   T: What do you believe the impact of disproportionality on districts and schools that are experiencing it?   S: Teacher shortages affect us all, but disproportionality makes it worse for those districts and schools that are having to deal with it. |  |
