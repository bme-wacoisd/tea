Date:
Objectives:
Identify and analyze the use of the Universal Design for Learning guidelines in a lesson.
Evaluate the impact of using the Universal Design for Learning guidelines on learning.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe the Universal Design for Learning Guideline of providing multiple means of engagement to support learning for all students.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the field site campus teacher uses the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines to spark excitement, curiosity, motivation, and self-regulation to maximize learning for all students. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students practice planning and/or implementing an instructional activity that provides multiple means of engagement.

|  | Universal Design for Learning Guideline:  Provide Multiple Means of Engagement | Examples | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recruiting Interest | Allow students choice in how they might reach a learning target | Provide choice boards and menu options.  Offer choice in how students work.  Use examples aligned to student hobbies |  |
| Recruiting Interest | Provide opportunities for students to engage in learning experiences that are relevant and valuable to their goals and individual interests | Connect content to something. relatable to students. Incorporate a variety of contextually appropriate materials and resources. Provide a clear purpose for why the content matters in the real-world. |  |
| Recruiting Interest | Create a supportive environment where students feel safe to learn and take risks. | Set clear expectations and class routines. Use timers, cues, etc. for activities and transitions.  Provide choice in the sequence or pace for completing tasks. |  |
| Sustaining Effort and Persistence | Explain the important of goals and objectives | Display the goal in different ways. Provide frequent reminders of the learning target and explain why it matters |  |
| Sustaining Effort and Persistence | Provide flexibility with tools and resources to challenge and motivate learners | Differentiate the level of rigor of a task. Provide students will a range of tools and resources to use. |  |
| Sustaining Effort and Persistence | Foster collaboration and community through flexible grouping | Establish clear goals, roles, and responsibilities for cooperative learning groups. Allow students to engage in peer-tutoring |  |
| Sustaining Effort and Persistence | Provide feedback that guides students toward mastery | Provide frequent, timely, specific, and actionable feedback. Focus feedback on effort and improvement over performance |  |
| Self-Regulation | Support learners in setting personal goals that are attainable and that motivate them to take ownership of their learning. | Offer activities that encourage self-reflection and identification of personal goals. Model the process of goal setting. |  |
| Self-Regulation | Provide models, scaffolds, and feedback to help learners develop personal coping skills and strategies. | Model how to manage frustration and seek external support. Use real life situations to demonstrate coping skills |  |
| Self-Regulation | Support learners in developing an awareness of their progress toward goals and how to learn from their mistakes. | Provide charts or tools to help students track progress. Engage in activities that allow students self-assess and receive feedback |  |
