### Lesson 3.04: Practice in and Out of Text

Name:
Date:
Examine the following lesson plan and determine how students were asked to practice.





What are two ways that this practice activity does not provide opportunities for deliberate practice of skills in and out of context?
Answers may include:
- Students did not have the opportunity to read words with the ‘b’ as /b/.
- Students did not have the opportunity to practice reading words with ‘b’ as /b/ in a text.
What impact might this have on students’ ability to master the objectives?
Students may meet the first objective to hear and say the /b/ sounds in words. Students did not participate in much deliberate practice in reading or writing words with the /b/ sounds. They only formed uppercase B with pretzels and cheese. Because of this, students may have difficulty mastering the second two objectives.

| Practice Out of Text (Isolation) | Practice in Text |
| --- | --- |
| Students practice making the letter ‘b’ with string cheese and pretzels. Students write CVC words with the spelling ‘b’ to match a picture. |  |
