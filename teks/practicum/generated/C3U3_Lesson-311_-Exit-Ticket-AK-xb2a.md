### Lesson 3.11: Assessment Data

Name:
Date:
Students will respond to the following questions:
- Why is it important to use data from a variety of assessments?
- Each type of assessment provides a different level of insight into what students’ strengths and weaknesses are and helps support the teacher in planning instruction.


- Why should a teacher prioritize curriculum embedded assessments?
- Curriculum embedded tasks can tell a teacher how students use the standards to make sense of the text, analyze, synthesize, and make arguments about the ideas and content within texts. They also help show the teacher where students may need additional support. The curriculum embedded helps drive a teacher’s instructional decisions because they are timely and allow teachers to make immediate adjustments to instruction.


- What are common pitfalls when responding to assessment data?
- Attempting to improve cold read performance with more cold read practice.
- Assessing too frequently
- Aligning instruction and reteach to discrete, skills- based lessons.
- Disaggregating data based on discrete comprehension standards.
- Inserting skills-based mini lessons

- What assessment types have you noticed in your internship experience? How has the teacher used those assessments to drive instruction?
- Student responses will vary based on internship experience.
