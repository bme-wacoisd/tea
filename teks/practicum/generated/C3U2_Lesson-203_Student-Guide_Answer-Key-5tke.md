Mrs. Matkins | Dear Mary Clare,  Thank you for writing and I am so sorry to hear you are sick!   Please read Chapters 2 and 3 in your textbook. You will find the questions on Google Classroom in this week’s assignments. The title is “Chapter 2 and 3 Review Questions.” Please answer these and turn them in online. You do you have your project due next week. Please let me know if you require an extension.  Get better soon! Mrs. Matkins |
| This is not effective because it is not clear and does not answer the question, it does not have professional content because it talks about her dog, it is informal, and there are grammatical and spelling errors. | This is effective because it is clear and achieves the goal, it is the appropriate tone and level of formality, is simple and on topic, it remains professional, and has no grammatical or spelling errors. |


| Example | Level of Effectiveness |
| --- | --- |
| Mr. Edwards writes a report to another teacher about a shared student for an IEP.   Elias’s math is pretty good. He hasn’t improved much since his las report card. | 2 – He keeps it simple, but it is not professional, and it is not clear exactly what he means by “his math.” It also seems a little informal for a written report. Mr. Edwards could write his grades or some examples of how he has improved. |
| Ms. Garcia writes directions for her first-grade students.   Write the numbers in sequential order from highest to lowest. | 3 – The directions are clear, and it achieves the goal, however it is not appropriate for the audience. A first grader might not know the term ‘sequential order.’ Ms. Garcia could change the language to make it more age appropriate and give an example. |
| Mr. Freeman gives a high school student feedback on their essay about Romeo and Juliet.   John, I think this essay is well written and clear. You support your thesis that Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy by giving clear examples from various acts. You received marks off because of grammar and spelling, and there are a few sections where you could have provided more explanation and analysis. | 4/5 – This feedback to a student is positive, professional, age appropriate, and clear. It explains why he received the grade he received and stays on topic. Mr. Freeman could be more  specific perhaps on suggestions/examples of analysis. |


| Dear Sixth Grade Teacher,   I am concerned about J.R.’s work since we have been on vacation for a week. Please let me know what he needs to complete for your class, so he is not behind.   Thank you,  Angela Fox. |

| Your Response:  Dear Mrs. Fox,   Thank you so much for your email and I hope you and your family have enjoyed your vacation.   In regard to the work for my class the last week, we have been working on Ancient Greece and Rome. J.R. will be able to catch up by logging into Google Classrooms to access the week he has missed (Week 12). There are five classes and links for each class. He will need to complete: Class Readings for each class (1-5) Guided Questions for each class (1-5) Homework from all classes of that week   He does not need to complete any classwork beyond the reading and the questions. I will waive all other work and quizzes with excused absences.   Thank you and please let me know if you have any further questions.   Kindly,  Mr. XXXX |
