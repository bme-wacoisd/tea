### Tool Name: Unit Plans

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Observe and reflect on the sequencing of lessons within a unit plan.
- Observe and reflect how learning is sequenced throughout a unit to build understanding.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is to enhance student understanding of unit plan sequencing through observation, review, and reflection upon how unit sequencing impacts students and teachers.
Summary: This tool asks students to investigate the lessons within a past unit and consider the sequencing of the lessons and how student learning is connected between lessons. Next, students are asked to discuss with the field site teacher how learning is sequenced to begin with simple concepts that build in complexity through the unit. Lastly, students are invited to reflect upon how the organization of learning supports both students and teachers.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 6.02: Sequencing a Unit Plan
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 3: The student explores the teaching and training profession. The student is expected to: (B) summarize and apply pedagogical knowledge and skills needed by teaching and training professionals.
- Standard 6: The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) explain the role of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills in planning and evaluating instruction; (C) explain the rationale for and process of instructional planning components such as vertical alignment and scope and sequence; and (F) demonstrate lesson planning to meet instructional goals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and uses effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.
