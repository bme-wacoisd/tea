Bellringer:
A 4th grade teacher is planning for their next unit from high-quality instructional curriculum, but they are concerned that the text complexity is too advanced for many of their students who are struggling readers. The teacher decides to find an alternative text on a lower reading level that they feel might be more appropriate and engaging for their students. How will this decision impact their students?

Practice: The Impact on Vocabulary
A 5th grade teacher plans to have her students read an article about an owl that was stuck in the Rockefeller Center’s Christmas tree. Knowing she has students on various reading levels, she decides to use leveled texts. All her students will read and learn about the Rockefeller Christmas tree owl, but the texts will be modified to different reading levels. The students reading on grade level will receive the text on a 5th grade level. Students who are just below grade level will receive the text on a 4th grade level. Students who are significantly below grade level will read the text on a 3rd grade level.

With a partner, review the texts at the three different levels. As you scan, take notes on what you notice about the text at each level. For example, how does the vocabulary change at each level? How does the language change at each level? How does that impact the meaning of the text?
