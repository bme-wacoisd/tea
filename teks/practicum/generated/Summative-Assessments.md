### Tool Name: Summative Assessments

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Evaluate and assess summative assessments for alignment to characteristics of effective assessment.
- Design and reflect on summative assessments for alignment to success criteria.
Purpose: This tool synthesizes student understanding of various summative assessments by evaluating assessment effectiveness, designing a performance task, and imagining the components of a large-scale portfolio assessment.
Summary: Students are reminded of the various types of summative assessments (projects, quizzes/tests, essays, performance tasks, and portfolio assessments) and the universal effectiveness criteria by which they may be evaluated: aligned with learning target(s), measures appropriate level of rigor based on learning target, fair and transparent, practical, and cognitive engaging. After completing an evaluation task, students are invited to design a performance task for an upcoming learning target and share it with the field site campus teacher for feedback and future use, if appropriate. Lastly, students are asked to consider what a portfolio assessment of their high school experience might look like, given the expectations for effective summative assessments.

Lesson 5.11: Characteristics of Effective Summative Assessment | Introduction to Summative Assessment Practices
Lesson 5.12: Summative Assessments| Paper and Pencil Assessments

Connected Instructional Practice TEKS:
- Standard 3: The student explores the teaching and training profession. The student is expected to: (B) summarize and apply acquired pedagogical knowledge and skills needed by teaching and training professionals.
- Standard 6: The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (D) describe principles and theories that impact instructional planning; and (F) demonstrate lesson planning to meet instructional goals.
- Standard 8: The student assesses teaching and learning. The student is expected to: (A) describe the role of assessment as part of the learning process; (C) analyze the assessment process; and (D) use appropriate assessment strategies in an instructional setting.

Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and uses effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

Observe:  Evaluate a summative assessment that will be or has been used to determine to what extent students met the learning objectives. It may be a project, quiz, test, essay, performance task, or portfolio assignment if it is evaluative and used at the end of a learning sequence. Determine to what extent you agree that the summative assessment meets effectiveness criteria using a scale of 1 - 5:

The performance task should include a complex challenge and assess a higher level of thinking. Use the effectiveness criteria listed below to guide your work.  It is encouraged that the student uses the curriculum already used by the field site teacher, and it is not the expectation that the student makes it up themself. |  |
