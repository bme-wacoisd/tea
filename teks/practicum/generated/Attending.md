## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Attending to the Most Important Content

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Describe why focusing attention on the most important content is necessary for effective instruction.
- Analyze examples of learning activities to determine how they focus student attention on the most important content.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for to observe how the focus of students’ attention in class will determine the level of engagement of their working memory and the likelihood of learning.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the field site campus applies the science of learning principle of attending to focus students’ attention, maximize the level of engagement of their working memory, and increase the likelihood of learning. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students practice planning and/or implementing an instructional activity.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 4.03:  Practicing with Attending to the Most Important Content
Lesson 4.04:  New Learning is Built on Previous Learning
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 4: The student understands the learner and the learning process. The student is expected to: (A) relate and implement principles and theories of human development to teaching and training situations; (B) relate and implement principles and theories about the learning process to teaching and training situations; (C) demonstrate and implement behaviors and skills that facilitate learning.
- Standard 5:  The student interacts effectively in the role of an educator. The student is expected to: (A) demonstrate effective interaction skills with stakeholders such as students, educators, parents/guardians, community members, and other professionals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

| Science of Learning Principle I: Attending to the Most Important Content | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Anticipatory Set: a short, introductory activity at the beginning of a lesson about the topic of the day that anticipates the learning to gets students thinking about the content they will learn. Look for: -Evidence of connecting prior knowledge to new learning. -Evidence that students are thinking about the new content. |  |
| Prior Knowledge: information or context a learner already has about a topic before they learn new information; learning builds on prior knowledge; prior knowledge can help students make connections to new information, better understand new information, and store and retrieve new information. Look for: -Evidence that the teacher is learning what students already know about the content. |  |
| Direct Instruction The use of explicit teaching techniques and modeling to teach a specific skill.  Look for: -Clear explanation of the new content - Examples and nonexamples related to the most important content - Modeling and thinking aloud about concepts |  |
| Student Learning Tasks Includes guided practice, independent practice, and any student activities during the lesson.  Look for: -Tasks directly related to making sense of the most important content. -Tasks that require students to put forth thought and effort. |  |
| Misaligned Activities: activities that do not require students to attend to what is important to learn. |  |

| --- | --- |
| How do they determine what is the most important content they want students to remember? |  |
| How do they introduce a new concept in a way that focuses students on the most important content? |  |
| How do they structure direct instruction to make sure students clearly understand the new content? |  |
| How do they ensure that learning tasks are challenging for students and directly related to the most important content? |  |

| Implement an instructional activity that focuses students’ attention on a single and simple objective. Plan for how the content will be introduced, explained, and practiced. It is encouraged that the student uses the curriculum already used by the field site teacher, and it is not the expectation that the student makes it up themself. |  |
