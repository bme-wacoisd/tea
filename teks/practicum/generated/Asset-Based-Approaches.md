## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Asset-Based Approaches

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Identify characteristics of asset-based teaching
- Identify practices that hold high expectations for all students and identify why holding high expectations is important to successful teaching.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is to provide students with the opportunity to observe how an asset-based approach to teaching leverages students’ strengths while supporting all students in achieving high expectations for behavioral and academic achievement.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of asset-based teaching, sectioned into rows for high expectations, grade-level content, and behavioral expectations. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teachers. Lastly, students practice the planning and/or implementation of asset-based teaching.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
- Lesson 3.05:  Introduction to Asset-Based Approaches
- Lesson 3.06:  Asset-Based Practices
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 4: The student understands the learner and the learning process. The student is expected to: (A) relate and implement principles and theories of human development to teaching and training situations; (B) relate and implement principles and theories about the learning process to teaching and training situations; (C) demonstrate and implement behaviors and skills that facilitate learning.
- Standard 5:  The student interacts effectively in the role of an educator. The student is expected to: (A) demonstrate effective interaction skills with stakeholders such as students, educators, parents/guardians, community members, and other professionals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.
