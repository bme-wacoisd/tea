Name:
Date:
Respond to the questions below about the following ethical scenario:
Mrs. Jacobs, a 7th grade math teacher, is frustrated by the effort of a student in her class. She stops by the neighboring teacher’s classroom to vent. In sharing the story, Mrs. Jacobs tells the other teacher about the student, identifying the student’s name and providing specific details about the student’s academic record. Since the neighboring teacher doesn’t know the student personally, Mrs. Jacobs feels that there shouldn’t be a problem discussing the student and the situation.
Is Mrs. Jacobs acting in an ethical manner based on the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators? Why or why not?
She is not acting in an ethical manner. Sharing confidential information, such as specifics about the academic record, is not allowed.
What are some of the potential negative consequences for the teachers or students?
Information about the student’s academic record could be shared outside of the conversation, leading to negative outcomes for the student. Additionally, this situation puts the neighboring teacher into an uncomfortable situation and could lead to false judgements about the student.
- How could Ms. Jacobs have acted in a more ethical manner?
Responses may vary but may include:
- She could have talked about the student without using the student’s name.
- She could have spoken to an assistant principal about the student.
