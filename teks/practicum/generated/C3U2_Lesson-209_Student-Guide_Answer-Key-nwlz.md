| State Board of Educator Certification (SBEC) | Governing body in Texas that oversees the preparation, certification, and standards of conduct for public school educators |
| --- | --- |
| Non-Certified Employee | Employees that work within the school setting that are not required to have a teaching certificate to qualify for the position |


| Actions Taken | What does this mean? | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Place restrictions on issuing, renewing, or holding of an educator’s certificate either indefinitely or for a set term | Limit the teacher’s ability to get a teaching certificate for a set period of time or until conditions are met. | As a result of disciplinary findings, a teacher is not allowed to hold a teaching certificate in Texas for 5 years. |
| Issue an inscribed or non-inscribed reprimand | An inscribed reprimand is a formal acknowledgement of wrongdoing written directly on the teaching certificate. A non-inscribed reprimand is one that is in writing and available, but not placed on the teaching certificate itself | A written note is placed formally on the teaching certificate of a teacher due to ethics violations. |
| Suspend a certificate for a set term or issue a probated suspension for a set term | Take away a certificate for a period of time or to place restrictions on the certificate for a period of time | A teacher is allowed to keep their teaching certificate but is on probation for 18 months.  This means they will lose their certificate if another incident happens during that time period. |
| Revoke or cancel a certificate without opportunity for reapplications for a set term or permanently | To revoke a certificate or cancel it means to make it no longer valid. They can revoke the certificate permanently or for a set period of time | A teacher has their teaching certificate taken away due to disciplinary findings and is never allowed to hold a teaching certificate in Texas again |
| Impose any additional conditions or restrictions deemed necessary by SBEC | Allows the SBEC the discretion to come up with disciplinary measures that are appropriate for different and unique situations if it meets the disciplinary policy guidelines | A teacher is required to attend ethics trainings in order to reinstate their license after a period of time. |
