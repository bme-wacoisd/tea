### Lesson 3.12: UDL in Literacy Instruction

Respond to the following questions:
- How does a traditional approach to planning differ from a UDL approach?
- With a traditional approach, the teacher usually plans for the “average” student in mind and then modifies the activities for some learners. This approach reduces rigor of activities for students performing below-grade level. With a UDL approach, all students have full access to learning opportunities. The teacher provides clear outcomes and anticipates differences in learner abilities and experiences. The teacher uses embedded support for below and above grade level learners. The teacher provides embedded scaffolds and supports as needed to support access while maintaining rigor.


- How does a UDL approach promote more accessible outcomes for all students?
- A UDL approach minimizes barriers and maximizes learning for all students. UDL provides flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences through engagement, representation, and expression. With UDL, the teacher does not give lower-level students easier tasks but provides the necessary supports and scaffolds to access the same grade-level content.

- How have you seen a UDL approach to planning in your own internship experience?
- Student responses will vary based on experience.
