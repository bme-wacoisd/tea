| Rationale/ Summary | Effective Math instruction requires teachers to balance the spiraled review of foundational math skills to guarantee all students are prepared to access grade-level content. This challenge can lead math teachers to fall into four different instructional of pitfalls that limit their ability to provide effective instruction for all students. In this lesson, students will examine these pitfalls and discuss strategies to avoid them. | Effective Math instruction requires teachers to balance the spiraled review of foundational math skills to guarantee all students are prepared to access grade-level content.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Match the teacher mindset with the common pitfalls in math instruction. Select one of the teachers comments from the table above and explain why the pitfall they are expressing can negative impact student success. Then, provide an alternative for how they can still address these needs while providing grade-level instruction. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Match the teacher mindset with the common pitfalls in math instruction.

|  | This lesson includes a tie-in to the math intervention students are discussing with their cooperating teacher (introduced in 4.10.) If students’ have not yet discussed with their cooperating teacher or are not able to perform this intervention in their internship, have them use the Sample Math Intervention Scenario included in 4.10. |  |
| 4 mins | Bellringer:  Mark the following as true or false. _______ Teachers must balance procedural and conceptual math instruction to build greater understanding of math concepts. _______ If students cannot perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division from memory, they cannot be successful with more advanced math concepts. _______ When students do not understand a lesson, it is best to reteach that lesson the next day to give students more “at-bats.” _______ The most effective math interventions tie review of foundational skills into grade-level content. | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Bellringer Review T: (Review bellringer responses without formally establishing if each are true or false. Allow students to provide rationale before introducing the lesson.) S: (Explain responses on bellringer questions. |  |
| 10 mins | Instruction: Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction Notes T: As we have discussed throughout this unit, Math is a subject area in which concepts must build on top of each other. This requires that teachers ensure that they are not only introducing new content but also making sure that students have the foundational skills to master that new, grade-level content. Balancing this need presents teachers with a few instructional pitfalls that they must avoid.   T: Please complete the table in your student guide titled “Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction” as we discuss these dangers for math instruction.   T: First, is one we have already discussed, Remediation. What is remediation and why may it be a pitfall?  S: Remediation is where teachers review older content before moving onto grade-level content. It can be a pitfall because some teachers would spend too much time remediating, limiting a student’s ability to engage in grade-level content.  T: Exactly. Please note in your table that Remediation is when a teacher Prioritizing below grade-level content. It is a challenge because it prevents students from accessing grade-level content and may lead students to have a negative association with Math.  T: Next is Procedural Instruction. We discussed procedural fluency earlier in our unit. What does this term mean?  S: Procedural instruction is the teaching of math "tricks" to solve problems rather than understanding why things work mathematically.  T: Procedural fluency is a necessary part of math instruction. However, exclusively relying on procedural Instruction is a pitfall where teachers focus on using procedures and procedural fluency to speed up instruction. Developing conceptual understanding is complex and takes time. When time is limited, some teachers easily fall into this pitfall of focusing on just helping students know the steps to solve something. Why might this present a challenge for students?  S: They will not understand the WHY of the procedure, and so it will be harder for them to apply the concept to new or different problems.  T: If students have a procedural understanding of subtraction, they know that you can borrow from the tens place when subtracting from two-digit numbers:   1   15 25 - 8 17  T: Without a conceptual understanding of subtraction, they may struggle to know what to do when they are introduced to problem where borrowing does not work.  0    13 13 - 8 ?  T: So procedural instruction is a challenging pitfall because when students only have procedural knowledge of math concepts, they lack a true understanding of WHY these procedures work, limiting their ability to apply this knowledge in different contexts.  T: The next pitfall is prioritizing Fluency Practice. This is almost a combination of remediation and procedural instruction. For many math concepts that build on each other, fluency in basic math facts like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are vital. Because of that teachers often feel the need to spend time ensuring students have these facts down before moving on to something else. Like our example of procedural instruction, fluency practice is an important part of math instruction. However, it cannot be the only approach a teacher uses. This pitfall is focusing on student understanding of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division at the expense of grade level content. This is a significant challenge because it pulls students away from deeper conceptual knowledge and grade-level content.  T: The final pitfall is Repeating the First Teach. Just from context clues, what do you think this pitfall is?  S: Teachers would just teach the same lesson again if students did not understand.  T: Correct, this is when teachers are reteaching content the same way again to provide more “at-bats.” Why do you think this is an issue?  S: If student do not get something the first time, teaching it again is not going to help. The teacher needs to try a new way to show them how to understand the concept.  T: It goes against what we know are important UDL principles, that students need multiple entry points into a math concept to be successful, especially if they did not understand the first entry point attempted.  T: Raise your hand if you have ever had a math class where a teacher spent a lot of time on Remediation.  S: (Raise hands)  T: Raise your hand if you have had teachers focus too much on procedural instruction.  S: (Raise Hands)  T: (Ask students to raise hands for Prioritizing Fluency Practice and Repeating the first teach.)  T: As you can see, these are pitfalls we all have experienced, and you can understand why teachers would fall into them. On the surface, they make sense. However, when we are trying to ensure that students have a deep understanding of math and can access grade-level content, these can be significant barriers to effective math instruction. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 17 mins | Practice: Identifying Strategies to Overcome Intervention Pitfalls T: Now that we know these pitfalls, what can teachers do to avoid them? In the next section of your student guide, you will see a table with example scenarios for each pitfall. With a partner take the next eight minutes to review each scenario to identify the pitfall and, using prior knowledge you have built throughout this unit, suggest an alternative approach, and explain why it is a better intervention strategy.  S: (Complete the table in pairs) T: (Review student responses, pushing students to provide rationale for their alternative approaches.) T: Let us think about how these pitfalls can apply to your field experiences. You are currently discussing the possibility of executing a just-in-time math intervention in your internship class. What do you think is the biggest pitfall you could fall into with this intervention? How might you address this pitfall? Consider the content of the intervention, the skills students are lacking, and your own experience as a math student. Take four minutes to Independently respond to these questions in your student guide. |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Can I have a volunteer share the pitfall they are most concerned about and how they might address it?   S: (Responses will vary)   T: (Help students discuss ways to overcome these pitfalls, as needed.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
