Discussion and Notes: Role of the Teacher


Practice: Examining Teacher Practice
As a small group, read each of the three scenarios and identify each as an example of the three roles teachers hold or a non-example and why.


| Academic leader |  |
| --- | --- |
| Behavioral leader |  |
| Reflective leader |  |


| Scenario | Examples | Non-examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario #1: Mr. Thomas is a third-year teacher, and this is his first-year teaching second grade. He often struggles with classroom management and even though he cares a great deal about his students he often finds himself using punitive measures to manage his classroom. His principal has assigned him a mentor, but he often does not show up for the meetings with his mentor or is late and unprepared. |  |  |
| Scenario #2:  Mrs. Ekbald is a teacher who is new to the school. She is teaching third grade for the first time. She has a student who have poor attendance. She has reached out to parents and the parents have promised to get them to school more regularly. When the student is in school, she finds time during the day to give her extra assistance on what she has missed. She also has the classroom volunteer to spend extra time with her as well. She does not take her recess period away to do work and makes sure she has all her missing assignments to take home when she is absent. She has met with the counselor about her concern with the student. |  |  |
| Scenario #3:  Mr. Stevens is a veteran teacher. He has taught several different grade levels and often serves as a mentor teacher. He remembers his students’ birthdays and communicates with parents regularly about what is happening in his classroom. He has been asked to lead the school’s curriculum committee and just signed up for the districts reading professional development series. |  |  |
