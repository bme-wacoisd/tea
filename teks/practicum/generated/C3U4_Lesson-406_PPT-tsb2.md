## Slide 9

### Exit Ticket

- Mr. R. is working on a word problem with a group of students. They need to use the information in the problem to set up an equation, which they then need to solve. They are stuck on how to set up the equation, so Mr. R. tells them what the equation needs to be. The students say that they don’t know how to solve the problem. He gives them time to solve the problem before checking their work. Three of the students answered correctly, but one got the incorrect answer. Mr. R. points out the correct steps the student took to solve the equation and praises them before asking them to double-check their work on the steps they completed incorrectly.
