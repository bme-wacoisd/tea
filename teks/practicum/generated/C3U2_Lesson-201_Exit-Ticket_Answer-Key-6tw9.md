Why is professionalism important in the classroom?

Teachers play a key role in supporting students to achieve success.  Exhibiting professionalism shows that you take this role seriously.  Failing to act professionally sets a bad example for students and may lead to a loss of trust and respect by students, colleagues, and families. Professionalism communicates to parents, students, colleagues, and administration that you can be trusted and helps them feel more confident in your abilities to guide student learning.

- Interactions with students
- Workplace professional conduct
- Appearance
