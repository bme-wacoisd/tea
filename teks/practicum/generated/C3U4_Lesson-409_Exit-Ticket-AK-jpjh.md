### Lesson 4.09: Curriculum Embedded Supports

Name:
Date:
Consider your own field experience during your classroom visits. What examples of UDL strategies have you seen your teacher (or other teachers) use?
Answers will vary.

Mr. L is teaching his fourth-grade math students how to add decimal numbers. The students are doing well with the content. Therefore, as an an in-class activity to show their understanding, Mr. L asks students to write their own word problem using decimals and demonstrate how to solve the problem. How does this assignment meet the criteria for UDL guidelines? How does it not? What else could Mr. L do to make this assignment more accessible for all students?
Mr. L’s strategy could use forms of Multiple Means of Engagement, as he is giving students an opportunity to create a word problem that might align with their own interests (since he did not say what the word problem had to be about). However, not all students will be able to successfully write their own word problem, especially those students who are English Language Learners or who struggle with reading/writing. Mr. L could allow students to demonstrate their understanding in multiple ways, such as teaching the class (verbal), writing a song about the process of adding decimal numbers, creating a visual aid, or working out a problem set. Providing students with the choice of how to demonstrate they understand the content would allow students who are not strong writers to be successful in this lesson.
