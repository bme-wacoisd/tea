## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: The Exit Ticket

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Observe and reflect on the characteristics of effective exit tickets.
- Evaluate and design exit tickets for alignment to success criteria.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to analyze exit tickets from previous lessons for success criteria (relevance, brevity, and variety), practice their own construction of exit tickets, and reflect upon students’ perceptions of exit tickets.
Summary: The observation component of this tool asks students to review prior exit tickets for the success criteria presented in Lesson 5.09.  Next, students are asked to apply those success criteria to designing an exit ticket for a future lesson and sharing that with the field site campus teacher for feedback. If appropriate, the field site campus teacher may choose to use the exit ticket in the respective future lesson. The student should analyze any results, discuss them with the field site campus teacher, and make recommendations for lesson planning as a result of that analysis. Lastly, the student has an opportunity to reflect upon how students view exit tickets and to consider a strategy for advocating for their use.
