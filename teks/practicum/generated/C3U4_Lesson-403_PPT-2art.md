### Misconception #1

- Misconception #1: Teachers should spend equal time on conceptual understanding and procedural fluency.
- Both are important, but conceptual understanding takes more time
- Conceptual understanding challenges the student to understand why they are following certain steps to solve a problem, even in the context of new situations
- Conceptual understanding allows the student to check for reasonableness of their answer.

## Slide 6

### Misconception #2

- Misconception #1: Procedural fluency is just practicing facts
- Procedural fluency is not just knowing what to do in a math problem, but when and how to do it.

## Slide 7

### Misconception #3

- Misconception #3: Procedural fluency happens before conceptual understanding.
- Teachers sometimes believe that students need to master every procedure to understand math conceptually, but that is not the case.
- Understanding ideas conceptually can occur before students have math facts memorized, while they are learning the concept and procedure concurrently.

### Exit Ticket

- Reflect on the math lessons you have seen taught during your field visits by providing short answers to the prompts below.
- What are some math concepts that students have struggled with?
- In what ways have you observed your mentor teacher model use of procedural fluency as well as conceptual understanding?
- What seemed to help the students the most? Why do you think that is?
