### Learning Styles vs UDL


| Learning Styles | UDL |
| --- | --- |
| Each student has a fixed and rigid way of learning Not supported by research Causes students to become limited in their views of themselves as learners Often leads to less rigorous activities for struggling readers | All learners need multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression Supported by research Proactive approach to addressing barriers in the environment and curriculum Makes grade-level content accessible to all learners |
