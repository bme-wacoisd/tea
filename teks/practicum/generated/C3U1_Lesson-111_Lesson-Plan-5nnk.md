It makes them think about it and narrow it down.   T: Why might it be important to update your educational philosophy throughout your career?   S: Sometimes what we believe or what we know might change and it would be important to make sure that was a part of our philosophy. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Components of the Educational Philosophy T: Today, you will learn the components of a teacher’s educational philosophy. Your educational philosophy represents your core beliefs about learning and teaching.   T: (Displays definition of core beliefs.)  S: (Record definition in Student Guide.)  T: We have already learned the components of a professional portfolio and know that your educational philosophy is an important component of that portfolio. What are core beliefs?  S: Core beliefs are foundational beliefs that we hold. It may be things that we learned growing up from our families.   T: For the bellringer, you were asked to reflect on why it might be important for a teacher to capture their educational philosophy in writing and revise it throughout their career.  T: Your educational philosophy helps to communicate who you are as a teacher. It captures your beliefs about how you should teach and how students learn. It is a tool for both you and any new prospective employer to understand your teaching approach.   T: Additionally, as you learn and grow as a teacher, it will be important that you periodically update your philosophy. Why would it be important to periodically update your philosophy?   S: We will grow and change as we learn more about teaching and ourselves as teachers and it is helpful that it shows up in our written educational philosophy.   T: Most educationally philosophies are either teacher-centered philosophies or student-centered philosophies.   T: (Displays definition of teacher-center philosophy and student-centered philosophy.)  S: (Record definitions in their Student Guide.)  T: With teacher centered philosophies, teachers believe that their main goal as a teacher is to transfer the knowledge and values that their students will need to do well when they graduate and move into society. On the other hand, teachers with student-centered philosophies believe that the student should be central in the learning and that the student actively shapes the learning environment and direction of the class. There are elevated levels of student ownership of learning under this philosophy.  S: As you get more experience and mature as a teacher, what you believe or know will change, and you want your philosophy to represent who you are as a teacher now, not who you used to be or what you used to believe. | Student Guide PPT |
| 20 mins | Practice: Your Type of Philosophy T: Which philosophy do you believe better represents what you believe?  S: I have more of a student-centered philosophy because I think that students should have more voice in how they are taught.   S: I have more of a teacher- centered philosophy because I think the teacher must determine what students need to learn and when and how they need to learn it.   T: (Direct students to take out portfolio materials so that they can draft their educational philosophy based on either a student-centered approach or a teacher-centered approach. For students who have a draft already, direct them to edit their current philosophy. For students without a draft portfolio, they will be capturing their thoughts in their Student Guide.   S: (Either begin to draft or edit their educational philosophy.) | Student Guide |

T: What was difficult about the assignment and why?   S: It was hard to narrow my focus. I agree with some parts of the both student-centered and teacher-centered philosophies.   T: Writing your educational philosophy is a challenging task, and many teachers adopt aspects of both the teacher-centered and the student-centered philosophy. Remember your philosophy is unique to you and will evolve as you learn and grow as a teacher.   T: (Direct students to follow classroom routine for saving portfolios.)
