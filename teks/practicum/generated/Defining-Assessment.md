Objectives:
Define assessment including formative assessment and summative assessment.
Compare/contrast formative and summative assessments.
Observe and reflect on assessment practices in the field.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to observe how formative and summative assessments are used to diagnose and evaluate student learning.
Summary: The tool provides a section for students to record their observations about assessments during a classroom lesson, sectioned by formative and summative rows. It also provides conversations starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students are asked to reflect upon their beliefs about the relationship between formative and summative assessments.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 5.01: Defining Assessment | Formative and Summative
Connected Instructional Practice TEKS:
- Standard 3: The student explores the teaching and training profession. The student is expected to: (B) summarize and apply acquired pedagogical knowledge and skills needed by teaching and training professionals.

| Formative Assessment: used to determine student progress during learning and inform next instructional steps diagnostic | What type of formative assessment did you observe? | What did the teacher learn from the assessment? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Example | The students individually answered fraction division problems using a whiteboard, then held up their answers after 30 seconds. | The teacher learned if students could use the standard algorithm to solve fraction division problems fluently. |

| Summative Assessment: used at the end of a learning sequence to determine to what extent students met the learning objectives; evaluative | Observe a summative assessment OR review the results of a recent summative assessment. What type of summative assessment did you observe? | What did the teacher learn from the assessment? |


| Discuss with the field site campus teacher: | Discuss with the field site campus teacher: |
