| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | For each scenario, determine whether the federal or state government should respond and why. Employers in a certain region of the country report that they need employees who have skills in cybersecurity, and they recommend that courses in cybersecurity should be created and offered as part of Career and Technical Education programs.  Members of Congress have reviewed research showing that students learn foreign languages more quickly when they learn them in elementary school (rather than middle school or high school). They have identified funding for elementary schools that want to start foreign language programs. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | For each scenario, determine whether the federal or state government should respond and why.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Who do you think makes the most important decisions about what happens in schools (for example, what students learn and the school schedule)? If you have taken other Education and Training courses, you can use what you have learned to make your choice. | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Review T: Please raise your hand if you selected the President as the answer to the bellringer.  S: (Raise hands if they answered the bellringer by selecting the President.)  T: Can I have some volunteers explain why they made that choice?  S: Answers may vary.  T: Please raise your hand if you selected the Governor of Texas as the answer to the bellringer.  S: (Raise hands if they answered the bellringer by selecting the Governor of Texas.)  T: Can I have some volunteers explain why they made that choice?  S: Answers may vary.  T: Today, we are going to explore the roles of the federal and state government in education. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Federalism as a Governance Model T: Before we begin, though, we are going to think about ways that countries can set up their governments. Federalism is one of those models. Federalism is a system of governance in which power is divided between the state and national levels. It is the model we use in the United States.  T: When you describe a country’s type of government, you might say that it is federal, for example, the United States and Germany have federal governments.  T: The word federalism can also be used in a different way. When you describe a law, organization, or level of government, you would use federal when you mean national. For example, if I say the federal Department of Transportation, I mean the national Department of Transportation, not the one in our state or this county.  S: (Add definitions and examples to Student Guide.) T: Over the course of the rest of today’s lesson, as well as the next lesson, you will be adding information to the graphic organizer that appears in this part of the Student Guide. This will allow you to easily compare the different roles that levels of government play in education. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Federal Governance of Education in the United States T: As public schools in the nation began, the federal government had little influence in education. When the Department of Education was first established, it collected data on schools across the country, but no one in the Department of Education decided what happened in schools.  T: Part of the reason for this limited control is the 10th Amendment. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution says that the federal government only has control in areas specifically mentioned in the Constitution. If an area is not specifically mentioned, then the states have the control. Education is not listed in the Constitution, so the states have power.  T: However, the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says that no state can make a law that denies anyone of “life, liberty, and property.”  S: (Complete chart in Student Guide.)  T: The first role of the federal government when it comes to education is protecting the rights of students and teachers and advancing equal access to education.   S: (Complete a row of graphic organizer in “Notes: Federalism as a Governance Model” section of Student Guide.)  T: Another way the federal government influences education is by providing funding to states and school districts that follow certain guidelines.   S: (Complete a row of graphic organizer in “Notes: Federalism as a Governance Model” section of Student Guide.)  T: Even though the federal government only provides about 10% of the money needed for public education, which is nearly $80 billion that states and districts want to get.  S: (Complete a row of graphic organizer in “Notes: Federalism as a Governance Model” section of Student Guide.)  T: Outside of the two roles we discussed, the federal government does not make decisions about education. States and school districts control most of the day-to-day decisions about what happens in schools.  A: (Add word to Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Notes: State Governance of Education in the United States T: Next, we are going to focus on the role of state government education governance. You will see that there will be some overlap, but also some areas where states have control, and the federal government does not.  T: Every state in the country has its own constitution, and every state constitution includes a requirement that it have a school system that educates students. While students attend individual schools that belong to individual school districts, ultimately, the state is responsible for providing education.  S: (Add responsibility to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: To accomplish this goal, states are responsible for establishing and maintaining academic content standards; setting requirements for educators to earn state licenses; administering federal money provided to the state to support schools; implementing a state assessment program to measure student achievement and growth; providing data on school quality to all members of the public; approving instructional materials for use in schools;  creating policies that guide the day-to-day operations of schools (like what courses need to be offered and requirements related to student discipline); and providing funding for schools from state money. For state government, the national average is around 45-50%, but it varies from state to state. In Texas, the percentage is around 35-40%, or around $20 billion.  S: (Complete rows of graphic organizer in “Notes: Federalism as a Governance Model” section of Student Guide.) T: When we say a “state” decides something about education, that statement is broad. Who, specifically, makes the decisions? To answer that question, we are going to look at the way Texas has organized its state-level education governance system.  T: There are several groups and individuals who play roles. I am going to describe each one in general first. Fill out the chart in your Student Guide.   T: The State Board of Education sets policies and standards for public schools in Texas. All fifteen members of the State Board of Education are popularly elected, and the governor selects one of them to lead the group as its chair. The State Board of Education makes decisions by voting.  T: The Texas State Board for Educator Certification oversees the preparation, certification, and ethical standards for educators in public schools. There are fifteen members, and the group makes decisions by voting. The governor selects eleven members, and they are the ones who can vote to make decisions. There are four other members who can contribute to the conversation, but they cannot formally vote.   T: The Texas Education Agency (or TEA, for short) provides leadership, guidance, and support for all public school students. Most people who sit on the two have other, full-time jobs, so TEA staff also support the boards with getting their work done. For example, they do research and write policies that the board members will vote on. The governor appoints a Commissioner of Education to lead the agency. This person makes some decisions, but other decisions are made by individual staff members who work there. Several hundreds of people work at TEA to support schools and districts.  T: Last, we need to consider the Texas Legislature. They make decisions on many policy areas; education is only one of them. However, they make some important decisions, including the amount of state money that is used to support education and how that money is distributed. They also pass laws with requirements for schools and districts. They can also pass laws that override other decision-makers in education, like the Texas State Board of Education.

| 6 mins | Practice: Roles and Responsibilities of Federal and State Government T: In your Student Guide, you will see boxes with specific actions related to education. We are going to connect them to the correct level of government would take that action.  T: The first box is requiring states to get involved in improving their low-performing schools. This is a requirement for a state, and it is about improving low-performing schools so that students in those schools do not have fewer opportunities than their peers. For those reasons, I will connect it to the federal government.  S: (Draw connecting line in Student Guide.)  T: Let us do the next one together. Can I have a volunteer read the next box aloud?  S: (Read statement aloud.)  T: Would the state government establish the TEKS for this course, or is that something the federal government would do?  S: The state government  T: Why?  S: The state establishes and monitors content standards.  T: Draw a line that connects those two boxes.  S: (Draw connecting line in Student Guide.)  T: Now, take three minutes and draw in the lines to connect the three remaining statements with the federal or state government. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: What are the two key roles of the federal government in education?  S:  Protecting the rights of students and teachers and advancing equal access to education and providing funding to states and school districts that follow certain guidelines.   T: What are some of the key roles of state government in education?  S: Answers may vary but may include: Establishing and maintaining academic content standards Setting requirements for educators to earn state licenses. Administering federal money provided to the state to support schools. Implementing a state assessment program to measure student achievement and growth. Providing data on school quality to all members of the public Selecting instructional materials for use in schools  Creating policies that guide the day-to-day operations of schools.
