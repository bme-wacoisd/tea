## Slide 4

### Teacher Modeled Example:

- TEKS Mathematics Grade 3, 3H: “Compare fractions having the same numerator or denominator in problems by reasoning about their size and justifying the conclusion using symbols, objects, and pictorial models.”
- Goal/Objective: Students will compare fractions with the same denominator and arrange them from least to greatest.
- 4

## Slide 5

### Teacher Modeled Example: Procedural Fluency

- Order the following fractions from least to greatest: 1/9, 7/9, 4/9, 2/9, 6/9, 3/9, 5/9
- Draw pictures to model each fraction above
- 5

## Slide 6

### Teacher Modeled Example: Conceptual Understanding

- Create a word problem or scenario for students to solve:
- Bob has a birdfeeder outside of his house. It holds 8 ounces of bird food. Each morning, he monitors how much of the food was eaten the day before, and then refills it to 8 ounces. He used the chart below to track the food amounts for last week. Use the chart to answer the questions.

| Day of the Week | How Much Food Was Eaten |
| --- | --- |
| Monday | 1/8 |
| Tuesday | 6/8 |
| Wednesday | 4/8 |
| Thursday | 2/8 |
| Friday | 3/8 |
| Saturday | 5/8 |
| Sunday | 2/8 |

## Slide 7

### Exit Ticket

- Reflect on your experience designing instruction for the math standard you selected. What was challenging about balancing conceptual and procedural instruction? Was one easier to plan for than the other? How does this activity impact your thinking about mathematics instruction?
