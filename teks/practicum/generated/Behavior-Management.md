# Behavior-Management


## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Behavior Management

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Identify and apply effective behavior management techniques
- Identify components of classroom reward systems such as sticker charts and computer-based behavior management systems
- Describe the benefits and drawbacks of classroom reward systems
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to identify and apply effective behavior management techniques.
Summary: The tool provides a section for students to record their observations about behavior management techniques and intervention strategies, with sections for evidence of preventive, proactive, and responsive behavior management. It also provides students the opportunity to apply their knowledge of behavior management techniques and intervention strategies through discussion with the field site campus teacher and the implementation of practices such as radar, scanning, proximity control, redirection, private individual correction, targeted behavior, and positive reinforcement.  Lastly, the tool prompts students to reflect on the impact of behavior management and intervention strategies for a safe and effective learning environment, through preventative, reactive, and proactive measures.

Observe:
- Note evidence of behavior management and intervention strategies that foster a safe and effective learning environment, through preventative, reactive, and proactive measures.
- Note evidence of Private Individual corrections that permit the teacher to build positive relationships with students, ensure students meet expectations, and foster a positive classroom culture.
- Note evidence of targeted student behavior, the discrete behaviors that the teacher has explicitly taught students and will reinforce when students exhibit these behaviors.
- Note evidence of positive reinforcement as an important tool to build student morale and motivation, communicating to students that they’ve been successful and should continue to do more of that behavior.
- Note evidence of existing classroom reward systems such as sticker charts and computer-based behavior management systems.
