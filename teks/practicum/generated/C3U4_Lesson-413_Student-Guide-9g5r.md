### Lesson 4.13: Supporting All Learners and Just-in-Time Interventions in Math: Intervention Reflection and Discussion

Name:

Bellringer:
Mr. W is about to begin the second math unit with his 6th grade math. Based on what he has seen from the first unit, he estimates that 6 of his 24 students (25 percent) still struggle with reciting multiplication and division facts from memory. He thinks that continuing to practice these skills is important for all students, so he has been spending the first 20 minutes of his one-hour math block just focusing on practicing multiplication and division with his whole class. Once they are confident in their skills, he feels that he can move on to more grade-level content.
Which pitfalls of math instruction is Mr. W experiencing? How can he avoid this pitfall?







Just-in-Time Intervention Discussion
In groups of 2, you will have the opportunity to reflect on your experience planning and implementing your just-in-time intervention. In this structured discussion, each student will have the opportunity to provide an overview of their experience (4 minutes) before the remaining group members have an opportunity to ask clarifying questions (6 minutes). Then, another group member will provide their overview.


| Overview Prompts | Sample Clarifying Questions |
| --- | --- |
| How did you select the content for this intervention? (Reference data, if possible.) What foundational skills were the focus of the intervention? What grade-level content do these skills support? When/How did you provide the intervention? What went well in the intervention? | How did students respond to the intervention? What would you do differently if you were to plan or implement another just-in-time intervention? What pitfall did you anticipate and how did you try to avoid it? Do you think the intervention was helpful for students in engaging with the grade-level content with their teacher? How do you know? How did the just-in-time nature of the intervention set students up for success? Would this intervention have been effective if it were completed at a different time? |
