### Lesson 4.06: Productive Struggle: Strategies in Action

First Role-Play
Student: I don’t know how to answer this question.
Teacher: Where do you need to start?
Student: I guess with how many cars the business had when it opened.
Teacher: Good. What do you need to do next?
Student: I’m stuck.
Teacher: You’re on the right track. I’m going to give you a couple of minutes to think about what to do now that you identified the number of cars at the beginning of the day. I’ll check back again soon.

Second Role-Play
Student: I can’t figure out this problem.
Teacher: What information do you know?
Student: I know there were seven people, and they need to split up a bill for almost $100.00
Teacher: What kind of operation do we want to use if we need to split something up?
Student: We need to divide it.
Teacher: Great! See if you can set up the division problem you need to complete. I’ll come back and check with you in a few minutes.
Student: I need to multiple 1/7 by 99.96. But I’m not sure how to do that.
Teacher: Is there another way you could solve the problem?
Student: I could divide 99.96 by 7.
Teacher: Great!

Third Role-Play
Student: I got an answer for this question, but I’m not sure if it’s right.
Teacher: What did you get?
Student: I got 564.

Teacher: How did you get that answer?
Student: I added up 25, 19, and 3, and then I multiplied that number by 3 and then by 4.
Teacher: Why did you approach the problem that way?
Student: I know we need to figure out the numbers in the parentheses first, so I added them up.
Teacher: You’ve got that right – we always need to do the math in the parenthesis first. Good job! You’re not quite there with the correct answer, though. Let’s look at the number inside the parentheses again. Think about what we have to do with those. I’ll check back in a minute.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Mr. R. is working on a word problem with a group of students. They need to use the information in the problem to set up an equation, which they then need to solve. They are stuck on how to set up the equation, so Mr. R. tells them what the equation needs to be. The students say that they do not know how to solve the problem. He gives them time to solve the problem before checking their work. Three of the students answered correctly, but one got the incorrect answer. Mr. R. points out the correct steps the student took to solve the equation and praises them before asking them to double-check their work on the steps they completed incorrectly. When did the teacher engage the student in productive struggle? When did the teacher miss opportunities to engage students in productive struggle? What could they have done differently? When did the teacher engage the student in productive struggle? When did the teacher miss opportunities to engage students in productive struggle? What could they have done differently?

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Describe a time when you learned something that was difficult or challenging. How did it make you feel? How did it affect your learning? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Bellringer Review T: In your bellringer, you reflected on a time when you learned something that was difficult or challenging. First, can I have a volunteer refresh us on what it is called when we struggle as we try to learn something?  S: Productive struggle.   T: Can I have a volunteer share how they felt during the struggle?  S: Responses may vary but may include: I was frustrated at first, but they I was proud when I figured out the answer. I felt good because the teacher thought I was smart enough to figure out the answer on my own.  T: Can I have a volunteer share how the productive struggle affected their learning?  S: Responses may vary but may include: It helped me learn what to do when I get stuck instead of asking someone for the answer. I learned that it is okay to not get the answer right the first time. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Strategies for Encouraging Productive Struggle T: During our last class, we considered some examples and non-examples of productive struggle. Today, we are going to explore some strategies behind those successful examples. After we discuss the strategies, we will have some time to do a role-play in which we will see what happens in instruction when teachers do, or do not support students in struggling productively.  T: (Share strategies on PowerPoint slides.)  T: The first strategy is to give students time to engage in productive struggle. Teachers want to help students, and it is tempting to step in as soon as we see that they are struggling. We need to hold back and recognize that they are learning in that moment of struggle. When have you seen examples or nonexamples of teachers giving students time to struggle?   S: (Responses will vary.)  T: The second strategy is to ask questions when students are stuck rather than telling them what the next step is. With some probing questions, students can think about options for how to solve the problem and come up with a plan themselves. Share with a partner a time when you have seen a teacher ask questions when students are stuck. What questions did they ask?  S: (Share with partner.)  T: The third strategy is to encourage students to solve problems in different ways. Often, there are multiple ways to solve a math problem. If a student gets stuck trying to solve it one way, encourage them to try another approach. If a student is stuck on how to subtract 31-17, for example, how could you help them find another way to solve?  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: The final strategy is to praise students when they are successful, as well as when they do not solve a problem successfully. Students can provide a wrong answer to a problem while still struggling productively and learning something in the process. Teachers need to praise them for this effort, as well as for when they get the answer right. What could you say to a student to encourage them to keep trying?  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: What are the four ways that a teacher can encourage productive struggle? (Call on one student, then ask the student to choose the next person to provide the next strategy.)  S: (Complete list of strategies in graphic organizer in Student Guide.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 15 mins | Practice 1: Role-Plays T: We are now going engage in three role-plays to explore the strategies in more depth. Can I have two volunteers for the first role-play?  T: (Select one student to act as the teacher and one to act as the student. Share the script for the first role-play with the students).  T: If you are not one of the actors, as the role-play takes place, you are going to complete the checklist in your Student Guide. Place a checkmark next to each strategy you see and hear, and jot down a note about how the teacher used the strategy.  T: (Display the problem being solved in the first role-play.) A business that rents cars is open for 8 hours on Monday. On Monday morning the business had 45 cars. The business rented 3 cars to customers during each of the first 5 hours. The business rented 2 cars to customers during each of the next 3 hours. The total number of cars that were brought back to the business by customers on Monday was 17.  Write an equation in which c represents the number of cars the business had at the end of the day on Monday (STAAR End-of-Grade Assessment in Grade 5 Mathematics, 2022 Released Form).  T: Let us begin the role-play with the student working to solve this problem.  S: (Acting as student) I don’t know how to answer this question.  S: (Acting as teacher) Where do you need to start?  S: (Acting as student) I guess with how many cars the business had when it opened.  S: (Acting as teacher) Good. What do you need to do next?  S: (Acting as student) I’m stuck.  S: (Acting as teacher) You’re on the right track. I’m going to give you a couple of minutes to think about what to do now that you identified the number of cars at the beginning of the day. I’ll check back again soon.  S: (Complete checklist in Student Guide during role-play).  T: Thank you to our volunteers! Let’s debrief this role-play. Can someone share a strategy they saw?  S: The teacher gave the student time to engage in productive struggle.  T: When did the teacher do that?  S: When they told the student to keep working and said they would check back.  T: Can someone share a second strategy they saw?  S: The teacher asked a question instead of telling the student what to do.  T: When did the teacher do that?  S: When they asked the student what to do first.  T: Let’s consider a second role-play. Can I have two volunteers for the second role-play?  T: (Select one student to act as the teacher and one to act as the student. Share the script for the second role-play with the students).  T: (Display the problem being solved in the second role-play.) A restaurant bill was paid equally by 7 friends. The bill was $99.96. How much money in dollars and cents did each person pay?  (STAAR End-of-Grade Assessment in Grade 5 Mathematics, 2022 Released Form).  T: Let us begin the role-play with the student working to solve this problem.  S: (Acting as student) I cannot figure out this problem.  S: (Acting as teacher) What information do you know?  S: (Acting as student) I know there were seven people, and they need to split up a bill for almost $100.00  S: (Acting as a teacher) What kind of operation do we want to use if we need to split something up?  S: (Acting as a student) We need to divide it.  S: (Acting as teacher) Great! See if you can set up the division problem you need to complete. I will come back and check with you in a few minutes.  T: After a couple of minutes, the teacher checks in with the student again.  S: (Acting as student) I need to multiple 1/7 by 99.96. But I am not sure how to do that.  S: (Acting as teacher) Is there another way you could solve the problem?  S: (Acting as student) I could divide 99.96 by 7.  S: (Acting as teacher) Great!  S: (Complete checklist in Student Guide during role-play).  T: Thank you to our volunteers! Let us debrief this role-play. Can someone share a strategy they saw?  S: The teacher gave the student time to engage in productive struggle.  T: When did the teacher do that?  S: When they gave the student time to figure out what to do with the two numbers.  T: Can someone share a second strategy they saw?  S: The teacher asked a question instead of telling the student what to do.  T: When did the teacher do that?  S: When they asked the student for the information from the problem.  T: Did anyone see a third strategy?  S: The teacher encouraged the student to solve the problem in different way.  T: When did the teacher do that?  S: When they asked the student to think about a way to solve the problem other than multiplying the total bill by 1/7.  T: There is one strategy we have not mentioned yet. What is it?  S: Praising students when they answer the problem correctly and when they get it wrong.  T: When did we see that?  S: They did this a few times as the student worked through how to solve the problem.  T: Let us consider a third role-play. Can I have two volunteers for the third role-play?  T: (Select one student to act as the teacher and one to act as the student. Share the script for the third role-play with the students).  T: (Display the problem being solved in the third role-play.) 3(25 + 19) + 4(3) (STAAR End-of-Grade Assessment in Grade 5 Mathematics, 2022 Released Form).  T: Let us begin the role-play with the student asking if they got the correct answer.  S: (Acting as student) I got an answer for this question, but I am not sure if it’s right.   S: (Acting as teacher) What did you get?  S: (Acting as student) I got 564.   S: (Acting as teacher) How did you get that answer?  S: (Acting as student) I added up 25, 19, and 3, and then I multiplied that number by 3 and then by 4.  S: (Acting as teacher) Why did you approach the problem that way?  S: (Acting as student) I know we need to figure out the numbers in the parentheses first, so I added them up.  S: (Acting as teacher): You have that right – we always need to do the math in the parenthesis first. Good job! You are not quite there with the correct answer, though. Let us look at the number inside the parentheses again. Think about what we have to do with those. I will check back in a minute.  S: (Complete checklist in Student Guide during role-play).  T: Thank you to our volunteers! Let us debrief this role-play. Can someone share a strategy they saw?  S: The teacher gave the student time to engage in productive struggle.  T: When did the teacher do that?  S: When they told the student to check the numbers in parentheses again.  T: Can someone share a second strategy they saw?  S: The teacher asked a question instead of telling the student what to do.  T: When did the teacher do that?  S: When they asked the student how they solved the problem before they told them whether the answer was correct.  T: Did anyone see a third strategy?  S: They praised the student several times.  T: When did the teacher do that?  S: When they told the student they were on the right track, even when they got the answer wrong. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Reflection on Field Site Experiences T: In your Student Guide, you will find a series of questions that ask about times when you have seen (or not seen) teachers engage students in productive struggle during your time in your field sites. Please respond to those questions. You have five minutes.   T: (Set five-minute timer).  S: (Complete questions in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Can I have a volunteer share an example of when they have seen a teacher engage students in productive struggle?  S: Responses will vary based on field site experiences.  T: Can I have a volunteer share where a teacher did not engage students in productive struggle?  S: Responses will vary based on field site experiences.  T: How could the teacher have changed what they did to engage students in productive struggle?  S: Responses will vary based on field site experiences. | Student Guide |
