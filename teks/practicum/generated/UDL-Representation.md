## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Universal Design for Learning | Representation

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
Identify and analyze the use of the Universal Design for Learning guidelines in a lesson.
Evaluate the impact of using the Universal Design for Learning guidelines on learning.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe the Universal Design for Learning Guideline of providing multiple means of representation to support learning for all students.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the field site campus teacher uses the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines to provide multiple means of representation during instruction. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students practice planning and/or implementing an instructional activity that provides multiple means of representation.

|  | Universal Design for Learning Guideline:  Provide Multiple Means of Engagement | Examples | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Options for Perception | Offer options for customizing the display of information | Provide materials that allow students to modify the size of texts and graphics, colors, and layout. Provide materials that allow students to change the rate of speech or sound and vary the pace and sequence of information |  |
| Options for Perception | Offer alternatives for auditory information | Show visuals. Provide closed captioning. Provide written transcripts from videos. Offer tactile alternatives for sound effects |  |
| Options for Perception | Offer alternatives for visual information | Use audio. Provide descriptions for images and graphics.  Provide tactile resources |  |
| Options for Language/Symbols | Clarify vocabulary and symbols | Pre-teach vocabulary and symbols. Provide definitions, explanations, and illustrations |  |
| Options for Language/Symbols | Clarify syntax and structure | Explain how words and phrases are arranged to form a proper sentence. Highlight transition words in a text. Use a concept map to show connections between ideas |  |
| Options for Language/Symbols | Promote understanding across languages | Make vocabulary and key information available in a student’s first language. Make connections in both English and a student’s heritage language. Provide cognates |  |
| Options for Language/Symbols | Present key concepts through multiple media | Provide images, audio, or videos to help students access the content. Provide charts or posters around the room that decode vocabulary and symbols |  |
| Options for Comprehension | Activate background knowledge | Use KWL charts or concepts maps. Make cross-curricular connections |  |
| Options for Comprehension | Highlight patterns, critical features, big ideas, and relationships | Use multiple examples and nonexamples. Provide tips and tools for organizing information such as color coding, graphic organizers, and annotations |  |
| Options for Comprehension | Guide information processing and visualization | Give explicit prompts for each step in a process. Chunk information into smaller elements |  |
| Options for Comprehension | Maximize transfer and generalization | Incorporate explicit opportunities for review and practice. Provide opportunities to apply learning to new situations, such as scenario-based problems. Prompt the use of mnemonic devices |  |
