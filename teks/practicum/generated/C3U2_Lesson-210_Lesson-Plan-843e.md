| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Mrs. Jacobs, a 7th grade math teacher, is frustrated by the effort of a student in her class. She stops by the neighboring teacher’s classroom to vent. In sharing the story, Mrs. Jacobs tells the other teacher about the student, identifying the student’s name and providing specific details about the student’s academic record. Since the neighboring teacher doesn’t know the student personally, Mrs. Jacobs feels that there shouldn’t be a problem discussing the student and the situation. Is Mrs. Jacobs acting in an ethical manner based on the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators? Why or why not? What are some of the potential negative consequences for the teachers or students?

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Give an example of each of the following types of ethical conduct: As a professional Toward colleagues Toward students | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Guided Practice: Scenarios on Ethics T: Today, we’re going to consider a variety of scenarios related to professional ethics. Before we begin, though, let’s remind ourselves of the three types of ethical conduct: as a professional, toward colleagues, and toward students. Can I have some volunteers share the examples they wrote down in response to the bellringer?  S: Responses may vary but may include: An example of ethical conduct as a professional is following state and local board policies. An example of ethical conduct toward colleagues is honoring the privacy of colleagues by sharing confidential health/personnel information. An example of ethical conduct toward students is maintaining a professional educator-student relationship.  T: We’re going to begin by considering a scenario together. It’s important not only to identify if a teacher has behaved ethically, but also, if they have not, how they could have acted in a more ethical way. Please locate the first scenario in your Student Guide.  S: (Locate section in Student Guide.)  T: Can I have a volunteer read the scenario aloud?  S: (Read scenario.)  T:  We’ll answer the three questions under the scenario together. The first question in your Student Guide asks if Mr. Jones is acting in an ethical manner. Can I have a volunteer share their thoughts?  S: He is not because he told other people about another teacher’s medical condition.  T: What are some of the negative things that could happen because of what Mr. Jones did?  S: It could put the other teacher in an uncomfortable situation if other people know personal information about her that she did not want to share.  T: How could Mr. Jones have acted more ethically?  S: He could have checked in on the teacher more frequently to see if she needs any help. He could also encourage her to share her medical struggles with her colleagues so that everyone can help support her.  S: (Respond to questions in Student Guide.)  T: Those are excellent ideas. As we think about the difficult situations in which teachers may find themselves, it’s important that we think about not just what they shouldn’t do, but what the better course of action is. | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Practice: Scenarios on Ethics T: Now, you’re going to spend some time working in groups to consider some additional scenarios. You’ll be in groups of 3 or 4 students.  T: (Use classroom routine for dividing into groups.)  T: Each group should first select a spokesperson who will be responsible for sharing the group’s thoughts when we come back together as a class. Next, you should discuss each scenario and complete each of the three columns. There are 3 scenarios, and you’ll have 5 minutes for each one. I will let you know when it’s time to move to the next scenario. Begin working.  S: (Select a spokesperson for each group and begin work on first scenario.)  T: (Set timer for 5 minutes and circulate to provide assistance, as needed).  T: Switch to the next scenario.  T: (Set timer for 5 minutes and circulate to provide assistance, as needed).  T: Switch to the last scenario.  T: (Set timer for 5 minutes and circulate to provide assistance, as needed).  T: Let’s review what you wrote. If you realize that your group missed something important or answered a question incorrectly, please add to the chart.  T: (Vary the spokespersons selected to share responses so that all groups are represented equally.)  T: For the first scenario, did Ms. Truman act ethically?  S (Spokesperson): No. She did not ask for permission from her students’ parents, and she did not tell the school administration that she was taking the students to the college. Also, she is transporting the students in her own car.  T: What is one potentially negative consequence in this situation?  S (Spokesperson): Responses may vary but may include: Students’ parents could become concerned if they cannot find their children during the trip to the college.  There is no one other than Ms. Truman to support the students if something goes wrong during the field trip, such as medical emergency. Depending on the school district’s policies, Ms. Truman could face negative consequences for her behavior.  T: What could Ms. Truman have done differently?  S (Spokesperson): Ms. Truman should have worked with the school counselor to organize a field trip to visit the college. As an official school field trip, she would collect parent permission slips, there would be more than one chaperone, and students would ride a school bus.  T: In the second scenario, did Mr. Madison act ethically?  S (Spokesperson): No. He did not spend $125 on supplies and asking for reimbursement for that amount is fraud.  T: What is one potentially negative consequence in this situation?  S (Spokesperson): Responses may vary but may include: Mr. Madison can face negative consequences for lying on his form.  The school loses money that could have been used to purchase supplies for students.  T: What could Mr. Madison have done differently?  S (Spokesperson): He should have filled out the reimbursement form for $75 only.  T: In our final scenario, did the teachers act ethically?  S (Spokesperson): No. They cannot prevent Ms. Hamilton from campaigning for office.  T: What is one potentially negative consequence in this situation?  S (Spokesperson): Responses may vary but may include: The teachers can face negative consequences for removing the campaign signs.  Ms. Hamilton may not win the election because her signs have been removed.  T: What could these teachers do differently?  S (Spokesperson): If they are residents of the school district, the teachers can vote against Ms. Hamilton. They can also show their support for other candidates publicly, as well as speak out about why they do not feel that Ms. Hamilton will be a good board member. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Did you find any of these scenarios difficult? Why? S: Responses may vary but may include: I thought the first one was hard because Ms. Truman cares about her students and is trying to help them go to college. I thought the second one was hard because Mr. Madison is working so hard. I thought the third one was hard because Ms. Hamilton doesn’t respect her students and the community. Someone on the school board should respect them.  T: Sometimes, we can sympathize with teachers who are trying to do the right thing. But we have to remember that the Texas Code of Ethics for Educators exists to protect students and teachers. It must be applied consistently. | Student Guide |
