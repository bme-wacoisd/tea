| Mr. Edwards writes a report to another teacher about a shared student for an IEP.   Elias’s math is pretty good. He hasn’t improved much since his las report card. |  |
| Ms. Garcia writes directions for her first-grade students.   Write the numbers in sequential order from highest to lowest. |  |
| Mr. Freeman gives a high school student feedback on their essay about Romeo and Juliet.   John, I think this essay is well written and clear. You support your thesis that Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy by giving clear examples from various acts. You received marks off because of grammar and spelling, and there are a few sections where you could have provided more explanation and analysis. |  |


| Dear Sixth Grade Teacher,   I am concerned about J.R.’s work since we have been on vacation for a week. Please let me know what he needs to complete for your class, so he is not behind.   Thank you,  Angela Fox. |
