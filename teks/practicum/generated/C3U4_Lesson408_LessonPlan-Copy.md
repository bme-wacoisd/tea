| Rationale/ Summary | A knowledge of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Guidelines provides a framework to guide teaching and instructional decision-making. Through UDL, teachers can help all students engage with the grade level content. The approach to supporting unfinished learning is important in math because math builds on itself. In this lesson, students will review the three UDL guidelines. Students will look at the differences between a traditional approach to planning versus a UDL approach to planning, consider at different UDL practices used in a 1st grade math class, and analyze scenarios to determine the impact of the approach on student learning and describe how a UDL approach could be used. | A knowledge of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Guidelines provides a framework to guide teaching and instructional decision-making.

|  | Note: Students should have examples of how UDL has been used during math lessons in their field sites.  Note: Students will likely need additional time to complete the Exit Ticket. Note: Practice 1 involves a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS), which we are intentionally excluded for the purpose of this lesson. The student does need support with operating with fractions, but not at the expense of missing grade-level instruction. The student should receive both. |  |

| 2 mins | Bellringer Review T: How do I meet the different needs of my students AND teach the grade-level TEKS as they are intended?  S: Responses will vary. | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Notes: UDL in Math Note: Students should take notes in their Student Guide during this section.  T: All students deserve an excellent education that teaches them at their grade-level. Students are all different. They require more or less time on subjects, have topics or content that they have fully mastered and have topics or content that they have not fully learned. Teaching involves figuring out how to meet different student needs.  T: Why do you think the stakes are high when a student is behind in a particular topic?  S: If we do not catch students up, they are going to continue to get further and further behind.  T: Every teacher is faced with the question: How do I meet the different needs of my students AND teach the grade-level TEKS as they are intended?  T: This question is especially important when you have students with unfinished learning. By unfinished learning, we mean knowledge or skills in the TEKS that students have not yet mastered – it could be content from earlier in the year or from previous grades or courses. Sometimes this is called prerequisite knowledge or skills.  T: Often, teachers think about how to address unfinished learning in two different ways. The first is a traditional approach. This approach, often called a remediation approach, is where the teacher modifies lessons for some learners so that they can address unfinished learning, such as giving them different problems than other students.  T: Let us outline why this approach can be problematic. Imagine a student has trouble with addition of whole numbers but is supposed to be learning to operate with fractions. What will happen if the teacher drills that students on whole number addition and does not teach them fractions?   S: They will fall further behind.   T: Right. Modifying the content to make it easier can mean a student never really learns the content and maybe never has an opportunity to try.  T: According to a report called the Opportunity Myth (2018), “Students spent more than 500 hours per school year on assignments that were not appropriate for their grade and with instruction that did not ask enough of them—the equivalent of six months of wasted class time in each core subject...”  T: The study also found that “In classrooms where students had greater access to grade-appropriate assignments, they gained nearly two months of additional learning compared to their peers.” That means that if we provide all students with access to grade-appropriate assignments, we will begin to close the gap.  T: That still brings up the question: How do I meet the different needs of my students AND teach the grade-level TEKS as they are intended?  T: This is where the Universal Design for Learning or UDL approach can help. What is UDL?  S: UDL is an educational framework to guide the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences through engagement, representation, and expression. UDL is an alternative approach that gives teachers tools to address different student needs without risking removing the access to the grade level content.   T: What are the three guidelines for UDL?  S: Multiple means of engagement, representation, and action and expression.  T: Right – The UDL Guidelines provide a set of strategies that can be applied to any subject or grade level to ensure that all learners can access and participate in meaningful, challenging learning opportunities (CAST, 2022).  T: Based on what you learned in the previous unit, what does multiple means of engagement look like in a classroom?  S: Responses may vary but should reference: Allowing students choice in how they might reach a learning target.  Providing opportunities for students to engage in learning experiences that are relevant and valuable to their goals and individual interests. Creating a supportive environment where students feel safe to learn and take risks.  T: What does multiple means of representation look like in a classroom?  S: Responses may vary but should reference: Offering options for customizing the display of information Offering alternatives for auditory information Offering alternatives for visual information  T: What does multiple means of action and expression look like in a classroom?  S: Responses may vary but should reference: Allowing students to share their learning in different ways. Providing alternative ways for students to interact with instructional materials and their environment. Providing access to and support with tools and assistive technologies Providing opportunities for students to communicate using multiple forms of media. Supporting learners in setting challenging and authentic goals  Provide flexible tools and processes to support organization and memory.  T: These guidelines, when used effectively, help students learn and can help us understand how to best teach so students can learn most effectively.  T: Through using UDL, teachers can give students the ability to engage with the grade level content even if they have some unfinished learning.  T: The approach to supporting unfinished learning is important in math because math builds on itself. So, it can be easy for teachers to fall into the trap of trying to address content that students have not yet mastered and NOT teaching the grade level standards. | Student Guide PowerPoint Opportunity Myth Source: Citation: TNTP.

| 5 mins | Practice 1: Guided Example T: Let us look at an example to compare a traditional approach with a UDL approach.   T: (Share via PPT as students follow along in Student Guide.)  A 6th grade math class is working on the following TEKS:    6.4(B) Apply qualitative and quantitative reasoning to solve prediction and comparison of real-world problems involving ratios, rates, and proportions.  The teacher gives her students the following word problem: Jay was paid $190 for a job that required 40 hours of work. At this rate, how much should he be paid for a job requiring 60 hours of work?  Many of her students were successfully able to complete the word problem, but one student has unfinished learning as he has a hard time operating with fractions. What should the teacher do?  T: With a traditional approach, the teacher might pull the student out and have the student practice operating with fractions. In this case, the student spends less time on the grade-level content.   T: On the UDL path, the student is supported in an environment where his effort is reinforced and his effort is encouraged, even if he struggled with fractional operations.   T: To support this student as well as all the students in the class through multiple means of engagement, the teacher might provide students with coping skills when they get frustrated, use prompts and scaffolds to help support students through the steps of the word problem, provide specific and timely feedback, and provide real-world examples that are relevant to the students’ lives.   T: How might the teacher use multiple means of representation to support this student? Turn and talk with a partner.  S: (Turn and talk.)  S: Responses will vary but may include: The teacher could model examples on the board. The teacher could walk the students through the process step-by-step with a graphic organizer.  T: To support students through multiple means of representation, the teacher may give students a variety of different ratios and proportions in word problems. The teacher may show worked examples on the board, model with drawings, or use a demonstration, such as making a recipe for the class.  T: How might the teacher allow the students to demonstrate their learning in different ways? Turn and talk with a partner.  S: (Turn and talk.)  S: Responses will vary but may include: The teacher could allow students to share their work with partners, use drawings or use words to explain their thinking.  T: To support students through multiple means of representation, the teacher may give students multiple ways to demonstrate they understand word problems using ratios and proportions, such as worked problems, explained answers, demonstrations, video explanation, etc.   T: Which approach do you think will most likely increase student understanding and promote more accessible utcomes for all students? Why?  S: The UDL approach because all students are held to high expectations and given access and support with grade-level content. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice 2: Video Analysis T: Let us look at an example of a 1st grade math lesson to see how UDL is used throughout the lesson. As you watch, take notes in your Student Guide on the different ways you see UDL practices being used to support student learning.  T: (Pause video at 2:48.)  T: Where did you see evidence of UDL in this lesson? Turn and talk with a partner to discuss.  S: (Turn and talk.)  S: Responses will vary but may include: Modeling  Clear instructions  Gradual release  Feedback from students after the model Whiteboard  T: Are there other UDL strategies you would have used during this portion of the lesson?  S: Responses will vary.  T: (Continue video. Pause video again at 5:18)  T: Turn and discuss with your partner where you saw evidence of UDL in this portion of the lesson.  S: (Turn and talk.)  S: Responses will vary but may include: Manipulatives Visuals  Vocabulary/math language  Multiple representations  Small groups  T: Are there other UDL strategies you would have used during this portion of the lesson?  S: Response will vary.  T: (Continue video and stop at 7:10)  T: How did the UDL strategies named in the video compare to the UDL strategies you listed?  S: Responses will vary.  T: Are there other UDL strategies you would have used to make this lesson accessible to all students?   S: Responses will vary.  T: The technology we have today is obviously more advanced than what you saw in this video. How could technology have been used to enhance the lesson?  S: Responses will vary but may include: Students could have completed learning activities on the computer that were personalized to their learning.  Students could have used online manipulatives, students could have watched videos, etc. | Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuTJJQWnMaQ&list=PLLKd3h8UX_F_f0XT9ze59-yl6gOv_obIj&index=2 |
| 10 mins | Practice 3: Scenarios T: You are going to work in groups of three to examine different scenarios. You are to read each. Then, with your group, you will determine what the long-term impact for the student might be and what a UDL approach to this situation might look like.   T: Let us look at an example.  Students in Mr. P’s 5th grade math class were given the following problem to solve.  A restaurant bill was paid equally by 7 friends. The bill was $99.96. How much money in dollars and cents did each person pay?  (STAAR End-of-Grade Assessment in Grade 5 Mathematics, 2022 Released Form)  Most of the students were able to complete the problem with ease, but one student struggled with decimals. The teacher decided to modify the numbers in the word problem so that the student would only have to solve the problem using whole numbers instead of decimals.  T: What is the long-term impact for this student?  S: The student is going to continue to fall further behind and is not going to be prepared for the End-of-Grade Assessment.   T: What might a UDL approach look like? Turn and talk with a partner.  S: (Turn and talk.)  S:  Responses will vary but may include:  Model examples on the board  Use models with drawings.  Use a demonstration with actual money.  Provide step-by-step directions for the student to access at his desk.  T: Opposed to giving the student simplified numbers, the teacher could provide supports and scaffolds to allow the student to access the same grade-level content.   T: Now, get into groups of three.  S: (Get into groups of 3.)  T: Locate the section titled “Practice: Scenarios” in your Student Guide.  S: (Located scenarios in Student Guide.)  T: Remember, you are going to read each scenario. Then, with your group, you will determine what the long-term impact for the student might be and what a UDL approach to this situation might look like.  T: Are there any questions?  S: (Ask questions as needed.)  T: You will have 8 minutes to complete the activity. You may begin. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: Can I have a volunteer share an example of what a UDL approach to learning might look like for one of the scenarios?  S: Responses will vary but may include:  Model examples on the board,  Used a demonstration, such as a human number line where students represented numbers on the number line,  Provide step-by-step instructions for students,  Have students help complete problems on the board, etc.  T: What is the impact of using UDL?  S: All students have more opportunities to access the curriculum and demonstrate their understanding of the content. | Student Guide |
