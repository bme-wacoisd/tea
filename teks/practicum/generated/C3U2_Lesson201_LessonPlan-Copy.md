|  | Lesson Preparation: Locate the employee standards of conduct for your district. |  |
| 3 mins | Bellringer: Imagine that you are the manager of a business. What behavior would you expect from your best employees? Example: showing up on time. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share your response and your reasoning.   S: (Turn and talk.)  T: (Circulate the room and listen as they talk. If necessary, guide students to include dress appropriately, be polite, follow the rules of the store, treat others well, keep the workspaces clean, engage in the work—stay off personal phones, avoid doing personal business while working)   (Call on students and create a list of their responses on the board) |  |
| 5 mins | Professionalism & Ethical Behavior  T: All of the items on this list are part of being professional. What does it mean to be professional?   S: Behaving well on the job, doing your job well, representing yourself on the job.  T: What actions or behaviors are associated with professionalism?  S: Showing up to work on time, doing what you are asked to do on the job, using appropriate language, being respectful, having good manners, dressing appropriately.  T: (Share definition of professionalism via PPT as students record definition in student guide.)  T: Professionalism are the qualities, behaviors, and attitudes a person exhibits on the job. Examples of professionalism are showing up to work on time, dressing appropriately for the job, being respectful and courteous to coworkers and others you encounter on the job, taking responsibility, staying calm under pressure, etc.   T: Another aspect of being a professional is exhibiting ethical behavior. Ethical behavior means respecting and obeying the law, being honest and demonstrating good moral character, and being fair to all. | PPT  Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Key Areas of Teacher Professionalism  T: Why do you think it is important for educators to exhibit professionalism and ethical behavior?   S: It shows you care about your job. It models professionalism for students.    T: Teachers are in a position of public trust and must demonstrate integrity, honesty, and good moral character. When you exhibit professionalism, it shows that you take your role seriously and care about your students and the dignity of the teaching profession. Professionalism communicates to parents, students, colleagues, and administration that you can be trusted.   T: Let’s look at the four key areas of teacher professionalism.   T: (Share via PPT and briefly describe each key area.) Interactions with students – how a teacher engages and communicates with students Workplace professional conduct - how a teacher behaves at work Appearance – how a teacher visually presents themselves Interactions with colleagues and the community – how a teacher engages and communicates with colleagues, parents, and other members of the community  S: (add descriptions to graphic organizer in student guide)  T: Ethical behavior is outlined and enforced by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC). The Educator’s Code of Ethics lists the state standards for ethical behavior. (add to notes)  Professional behavior is also described and enforced at the district level. Districts use an Employee Standards of Conduct to outline the professional expectations for employees.   T: (Show students the employee standards of conduct for your district).  T: Let’s look at the standards of conduct for our district. As you review the standards, think about where you see evidence of the four key areas of teacher professionalism represented in the standards of conduct.  S: (Review district standards of conduct).  T: Where do you see evidence of the four key areas of teacher professionalism represented in the standards of conduct?  S: Student responses will vary based on district guidelines. | PPT  Student Guide                  Educators’ Code of Ethics  Dallas ISD Employee Standards of Conduct |
| 15 mins | Practice – Card Sort  T: We are going to participate in a card sort activity. The examples in the card sort are taken from the Educator’s Code of Ethics and a district Standards of Conduct. Your groups will discuss each card and place it in one of the four categories: Interactions with students Workplace professional conduct Appearance Interactions with colleagues and the community   T: We will do several examples together before you work in groups.  T: (Use the card, “Teachers shall report to work regularly and in accordance with their assigned schedule.”)  T: This card states, that “Teachers shall report to work regularly and in accordance with their assigned schedule.” What does this mean?  S: Teachers should come to work on time every day.  T: Yes. In which category should I place the card?  S: It belongs in workplace professional conduct because it is mainly about how a teacher behaves at work. It also doesn’t have anything to do with how the teacher looks, or how the teacher interacts with others.  T: Yes. Notice how we first discussed what the card meant, then gave reasoning for why we placed it in a certain category.   T: (Model one more example if necessary).  T: (Place students in groups to complete the card sort activity)  S: (Discuss and sort the remaining cards) | 2.01 Card Sort |
