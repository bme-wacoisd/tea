Why are both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency important when planning how to teach a lesson?

Modeled Example: Designing Instruction for Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency
TEKS Mathematics Grade 3, 3H: “Compare fractions having the same numerator or denominator in problems by reasoning about their size and justifying the conclusion using symbols, objects, and pictorial models.”
Goal/Objective: Students will compare fractions with the same denominator and arrange them from least to greatest.
Procedural Fluency:
Order the following fractions from least to greatest: 1/9, 7/9, 4/9, 2/9, 6/9, 3/9, 5/9.
Draw pictures to model each fraction above.

Conceptual Understanding:
Create a word problem or scenario for students to solve: Bob has a birdfeeder outside of his house. It holds 8 ounces of bird food. Each morning, he monitors how much of the food was eaten the day before, and then refills it to 8 ounces. He used the chart below to track the food amounts for last week. Use the chart to answer the questions.

On which day did the birds eat the least food? How much did the birds leave in the feeder? Draw a picture to help you explain your answer.
(Monday, because they ate 1/8 of the food, which is the smallest fraction he recorded. The birds left 7/8 in the feeder.)

On which day did the birds eat the most food? How do you know? Draw a picture to help you explain your answer.
(Tuesday, because they ate 6/8 of the food, is the largest fraction he recorded.)

Did the birds eat more food on Friday or Saturday? How do you know? Draw a picture to help you explain your answer.
(The birds ate more on Saturday than Friday because on Friday 3/8 of the food was eaten and on Saturday 5/8 of the food eaten. 5/8 is bigger than 3/8.)

Which days had the same amount of bird food eaten? Draw a picture to help you explain your answer.
(On Thursday and Sunday, the birds ate the same amount of food, which was 2/8.)

Order the days of the week from most food eaten to least food eaten.
(Monday, Thursday/Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday)

| Tuesday | 6/8 |
| Wednesday | 4/8 |
| Thursday | 2/8 |
| Friday | 3/8 |
| Saturday | 5/8 |
| Sunday | 2/8 |
