| 2 mins | Bellringer:  In our previous lesson we discussed how to be professional in communication during conflict.  What are two specific characteristics of professional communication during conflict? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | T: Your bellringer asked you to think about the characteristics of professional communication during conflict from our previous lesson.  There are four key characteristics that we discussed. Can someone give me one? (Call on students as they raise hands.  Keep calling on students until they list all four characteristics.)  S: (Raise hand to be called on.) Active listening, managing non-verbal communication, using “I” statements, and addressing the problem not the person. | Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Notes: Introduction Professional Communication with Parents & Families T: Parents and families are key partners in a student’s education.  Regular communication between the school and families is important in supporting the academic success of the student.  In this lesson, we will explore a parent-teacher conference as a specific type of communication between the school and families.  Please locate the Introduction section on your student notes.  You will take notes in this section as we discuss.  S: (Locate the introduction section on their Student Guide.)  T: Raise your hand if you have ever participated in a parent-teacher conference.  S: (Students raise hands.)  T: For those of you who have experienced a parent-teacher conference, how would you describe it?  S: A meeting between parents and the teacher about how the student is doing in school.  T: A parent-teacher conference is a short meeting between parents and the teacher that happens once or twice a year.  This conference allows parents and teachers to discuss the academic progress of the student as well as the experience of the student at school.  Why might it be important for teachers and families to have this type of conference?  S: They help everyone to know where the student is and what they can do to help the student.  T:  Since teachers have a lot of students, it is important for conferences be short and productive. Teachers must demonstrate a high level of professionalism in these conferences.  Before the conference takes place, teachers prepare for them by sending out communication to schedule and set expectations. They also review and collect student work to plan what feedback they will share with parents. It’s important that the teacher communicate with parents that they value the student’s success in school.  Below are some key steps to include in an effective parent-teacher conference.  These are listed in your student guide.  Please follow along as I read each step.  T: The first step is to greet the parents and establish a common purpose for the conference.  Can I get someone to read the example included in table on the student guide?   S: (Student reads statement from table.)  T: Why do you think it is important to greet the parents and share the purpose of the meeting?  S: Greeting the parents helps to make them feel welcome and sharing the purpose could help to focus the conversation.  T: The next step is to invite the parents to share their thoughts on how their student is doing.  Can someone read the example in the table?   S: (Reads example from table.)  T: Why is it important for teachers to invite parents to share their thoughts at the beginning of the conference?  S: So, parents can share any concerns they are having about their student.    T: Yes, it provides the opportunity to hear about the experience of the student from the perspective of the parent and can also help to focus the discussion.  The third step is to share positive feedback about the student.  Can someone read the example from the table?  S: (Reads example from table.)  T: Why do you think it is important to share positive feedback about the student first in a conference with parents?  S: Helps parents to hear the things that their student is doing right.  T: We always start with the positive.  It is important that these conferences are balanced, that is that you share both things the student is doing well but also those areas for improvement.  We share the positive first to help the parents to feel more comfortable in the conference and feel more confident about their student’s performance.  The fourth step is to share no more than 2 areas for improvement.  Can someone read that example from the table?  S: (Reads example from the table.)  T: Why do you think it is important to share no more than two areas for improvement?  S: Keeping it to two areas for improvement helps parents to focus on how to help their student.  T: It is important to realize that receiving feedback in areas to improve can be very difficult for some people.  Keeping it to two areas for improvement makes it seem manageable and focuses the efforts for improvement.  When providing this feedback, think about the two areas that have the greatest potential for impacting student success.  The fifth step is setting a goal for the student with the parents.  Can someone read that example for me?  S: (Reads example from table.)  T: Why is it important to set a goal for the student with the parents in a conference?  S: It helps parents to know better how they can support their student.  T: Setting a goal helps to create a plan of action towards improvement.  It clarifies exactly what a student can do to improve and allows for the parents and teacher to think about what they can do specifically to help the student to reach that goal.  The sixth step is to ask parents if they have any questions.  Can someone read that example for me?  S: (Reads example from table.)  T: Why is it important for teachers to ask parents if they have any questions?  S: Allows them to ask any questions they have before leaving.  T: Asking for questions allows parents to get any clarifications on what was discussed or to raise any additional concerns before the conference ends.  The final step is to thank the parents for their time and provide contact information.  Can someone read the example?  S: (Reads example from the table.)  T: Why is it important to thank parents for their time and provide contact information?  S: So, parents can know how to reach out after the conference.  T: It is important to thank parents for their time to establish a partnership with parents.  Providing contact information and inviting them to use it helps parents to know they can reach out any time and that you want to work together to support the student. | Student Guide PPT |
| 8 mins | Modeling: Characteristics of Effective Communication Role Play T: In a few minutes, you are going to practice communication with parents and families in a role play scenario of a parent teacher conference.  Let me show you what this will look like.  Can I have a volunteer to play the parent in this role play scenario with me?  S: (Raise hands to volunteer.)  T: The scenario is described in your Student Guide under the Modeling: Professional Communication with Parents and Families section.  Can I get a volunteer to read the scenario aloud as everyone else follows along?   S: (Raise hands to volunteer to read.  Volunteer reads the scenario aloud.)  T: Thank you for reading for us.  In the role play, you (pointing to student volunteer for role play) will play the role of the parent, Mr. Jones, and I will play the role of Mr. Tomlin, the teacher.   As we role play this scenario, I want everyone else in the class to be on the lookout for steps we discussed in a parent teacher conference.  Can someone remind us of what they are?  S: Greeting the parents and sharing purpose, inviting parents to share their thoughts, sharing positive feedback, sharing areas of improvement, setting a goal for the student, asking if parents have questions and thanking parents for their time and providing contact information.   T: Please locate the script for our role play in your student guide in the section titled “Modeling: Professional Communication with Parents and Families.” Please follow along as we role play this scenario.  (Engage in role play with student volunteer using script in student guide.)   T: Thank you (student) for helping me with this role play.  As you listened to this role play, where did you see evidence of the steps in a parent teacher conference represented?  S: The first thing that you did was greet Mr. Jones and tell him the goal of the conference was to share Simpson’s progress and ways he can be even more successful this year.  T: What else?  S: Then you invited Mr. Jones to share how he thought things were going.  He said Simpson seemed to like school, but he was concerned about his grades.  T: How did that transition to the providing positive feedback.  S: You agreed that Simpson appeared to like school and the grade was something to discuss today.  You shared the positive feedback that Simpson was very good at math and often finished his work ahead of others.    T: What were some of the things that I shared that Simpson needed to improve upon?  S: You said he was forgetful.  He was not turning in his homework each night.  T:  How did that lead to setting a goal for Simpson to improve?  S: You shared that the students write down homework every night in a journal and that it can be a goal for Simpson to share that with his father each night.  T: How did the conference end?  S: You asked Mr. Jones if he had any additional questions, thanked him for his time and provided contact information on a piece of paper. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice: Professional Communication with Parents & Families T: To practice communicating with parents and families, you will work with a group of four to role play two different scenarios.  T: (Arrange students into groups of four.)   T: Each person in the group will get a chance to participate in the role play, as well as serve as an observer.  There are two scenarios in your Student Guide.  Please locate them in the section titled “Practice.”  S: (Locate practice section.)  T: In a minute, I am going to ask you to get into your group of four.  There will be two rounds of role play, each lasting about 5 minutes.  As two members of the group role play the situation, the other two will observe and take notes on where they saw evidence of the steps of a parent-teacher conference we discussed.  At the conclusion of each scenario, you will have about 2 minutes for the observers to share what they saw and discuss the scenario.  Observers will record notes of evidence observed in the table under each scenario during the role play.  I will keep time to make sure that we get through both the scenarios.  Please move to your groups now.  S: (Move to assigned groups.)  T: Now that you are in your groups, decide quickly which two members will participate in the role play of scenario 1 and who will observe.  S: (Identify roles for scenario 1.)  T: Please briefly read through the scenario.   T: (Set 1 min timer.)  S: (Read scenario 1.)  T: I will set a timer for 5 minutes for you to role play.  What questions do you have for me before we get started?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: You may begin with scenario 1.   T: (Set 5 min timer.)  S: (Begin scenario 1 role play in groups.)  T: Time is up for scenario 1 role play.  Now take 2 minutes share the steps of the parent teacher conference observed.  T: (Set 2 min timer.)  S: (Discuss scenario 1.)  T: Ok.  Now let’s move on to scenario 2.  Please read through the scenario and decide on roles.  Remember, everyone should have the chance to be in a role play and serve as an observer.    S: (Read Scenario 2 and choose roles.)  T: You may begin with scenario 2.   T: (Set 5 min timer.)  S: (Begin scenario 2 role play in groups.)  T: Time is up for scenario 2 role play.  Now take 2 minutes to discuss what steps were observed.   T: (Set 2 min timer.)  S: (Discuss scenario 2.) |  |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: What is a parent teacher conference?  How do they help students to be more academically successful? S: Short meeting between teacher and parents/families.  It is an opportunity to communicate the student’s strengths and areas for improvement as well as set goals for that improvement.  It helps the teacher and parents to work as partners toward the student’s success. T: We discussed having some structured steps for a conference can make it more productive.  What are the steps of the parent-teacher conference that we discussed today? S: Greet the parents & share the purpose of the conference, invite parents to share thoughts on how student is doing, share positive feedback about the student, share no more than two areas for improvement, set a goal for improvement with the parents, ask for any additional questions/concerns from parents, thank parents for their time and provide contact information. T: Now that you have a better understanding of professional conduct and communication for a parent conference, your homework will be to interview your field site teacher about how they plan for, conduct, and follow up with parent conferences.
