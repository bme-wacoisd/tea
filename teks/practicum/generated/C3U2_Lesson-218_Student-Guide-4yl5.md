Bellringer
John wants to be a lifeguard. John meets the minimum age and swimming requirements, but now must take a 26-hour course to become a lifeguard where he will learn First Aid to help someone if they have an injury, CPR to help someone who cannot breathe, and the skills necessary to save a life. At the end of the course, he will take exams on CPR/First Aid, and an exam to test his knowledge to become a certified lifeguard. John becomes a lifeguard and passes all his exams. If he wants to remain a lifeguard after two years, he must pass all the exams again and he will continue to take them every two years after that. This is important to the safety of swimmers and patrons at the pool.

Why do you think John is required to take a 26-hour course to become a lifeguard?

Why do you think John must pass the exams every two years? Why is it important to swimmer safety?

Can you think of any other professions that require a person to have a certification or a license?  Do these professions require you to take courses and ‘keep-up’ your license?




Key Terms
Define the key terms below.

Notes: Continuing Professional Education


Model: Continuing Education Activities
TEA CPE Guide
Directions: Review the TEA CPE Guide to understand the requirements necessary for a teacher to receive credit. CPE activities can vary and can be on various subjects and can come from a variety of sources and activities.
1. What are the specific themes and topics for continuing education requirements?



2. What are acceptable types of CPE activities?

Example CPE Scenario:
A group of Special Education teachers take a professional development workshop together at their school to learn more about the Response to Intervention (RTI) method to identify students with disabilities and provide appropriate support. It takes place over two days, and they are excused from teaching those two days. This professional development is provided by their school district and is approved by TEA.
1) Is this an approved Continuing Education Activity? Explain your rationale.





2) How does this Continuing Education Activity lead to teacher success?

Practice: Continuing Education Activities
Directions: Using the TEA CPE Guide provided in the Student Guide and the notes you took in class to assess the 5 Scenarios. With each scenario you will want to answer the following questions:
1) Is this an approved Continuing Education Activity? Explain your rationale.
2) How does this Continuing Education Activity lead to teacher success?
Each station has one scenario. You will have two minutes at each scenario to read and complete the questions.
Scenario 1:
A teacher who teaches 9th grade Language Arts wants to learn more about how to incorporate technology into her classroom. The school where she works is sending five teachers, including the Library Sciences teacher and Technology Teacher to a conference to learn more on emerging technologies for the classroom. Teachers who attend will also receive credit for toward their 150 hours of CPEs required for license renewal. The teacher wants to sign up for a few different sessions, but the main ones she wants to sign up for include: “How to Assist Children with Learning Disabilities Use Technology,” “Teaching Literacy Using Technology,” and “New Digital Skills for the New Digital Era.”





Scenario 2:
Mr. Rice is a third-grade teacher and has been teaching for seven years. He just renewed his license a few years ago and plans to continue teaching for the foreseeable future. His school is offering professional development on Dyslexia instruction to help teachers with students with Dyslexia better understand how to serve them. The professional development is offered by the school and is approved by the Texas Education Agency. He currently does not have any students with Dyslexia but knows it’s becoming a growing concern. He decides to take the professional development and sees it as an opportunity to grow.





Scenario 3:
Ms. Freeman is a first-year teacher. She just completed her master’s degree in early childhood education and got her teaching license at the same time. She feels she’s up-to-date and doesn’t need to take any of the extra professional developments offered to her since she just got her license. One day she is reading online from a website that there is a two-hour webinar from a literacy website that she likes to use for students where they can play games and learn to read. She asked her department chair if this would count toward her CPEs, and the teacher was unsure whether it would be approved by TEA. She looks on the list of TEA approved CPE providers and sees it’s not there. She does it anyway and learns a lot to help her students!



Scenario 4:
A high school has approved a new School Improvement Plan, and it includes additional Professional Developments for teachers to support English Language Learners, students at risk of dropping out, and students who might have mental health issues. All the PDs are accredited and count toward teacher CPEs, and all teachers must participate – regardless of how many CPEs they have completed.








Scenario 5:

Dr. Ligon has been a chemistry teacher since the 1990s. She studied Chemistry in college and got her PhD later in chemistry. She finds an opportunity provided by the local university about new areas of information in the field of chemistry and she thinks it would be useful to her as a teacher to teach new information to her students. She signs up for the course and takes it in the evenings for a semester.
