RBIS Math Intervention Portfolio Project

As part of your portfolio, you will be asked to plan, and if applicable implement, a just-in-time intervention in your internship classroom. This will require you work with your cooperating teacher to:
Identify skills or knowledge that students need support with to master upcoming grade level math content.
Select students for this intervention.
Plan and implement a brief intervention (no more than 30 minutes) that provides a just-in-time intervention.
Respond to the following prompts to help plan and implement this intervention. If your cooperating teacher does not have a math block, please use the Sample Math Intervention Scenario to plan your intervention.








| Step 1: Identify Prerequisite Skills and Knowledge |
| --- |
| Based on your discussion with your field site teacher, summarize the selection of the just-in-time intervention content using the reflection questions below. |
| What data was used to identify the gaps in student knowledge? (Pre-Test, Quiz, Unit Test, Benchmarks, STAAR results from previous year, etc.) |
| What grade-level content standards will be taught? |
| Based on the data, what foundational skills or standards need to be addressed with just-in-time supports? |


| Step 2: Schedule using Scope and Sequence |
| --- |
| Based on your discussion with your field site teacher, summarize the scheduling of the just-in-time intervention using the reflection questions below. |
| When will you provide this intervention? |
| When will students engage with the grade level content this intervention supports? |
| What size group will benefit from this intervention (full group, small group, one on one)? |
| Step 3: Design and Implement Appropriate Interventions |
| Based on your discussion with your field site teacher, summarize the design of the just-in-time intervention using the reflection questions below. |
| Provide at least two examples of math problems that address the foundational skills taught in your just-in-time intervention. |
| Provide an example of a math problem that addresses the grade-level content standard students must be prepared to engage. |
| Explain how the foundational skills address knowledge needed to master the grade level content. |
| What instructional pitfall should you most need to avoid when leading this intervention? How will you avoid it? |


| Step 4: Reflection |
| --- |
| If you WERE ABLE to lead this just-in-time intervention with students, answer the following reflection prompts. (If not applicable, write N/A) |
| From your perspective, do you think students were able to improve their foundational skills addressed in the just-in-time intervention? How do you know? |
| Did this help students engage with the grade level content? (You may need to discuss with your supervising teacher.) |
| If you WERE NOT ABLE to lead this just-in-time intervention with students, answer the following reflection prompts: (If not applicable, write N/A) |
| How would you know if students were successful in improving their foundational skills during the just-in-time intervention? |
| What other foundational skills may students need to master to successfully engage with the grade-level content standards? |
