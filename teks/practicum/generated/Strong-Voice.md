Date:
Objectives:
- Define and describe strong voice and 3 types of register (casual, formal, and urgent)
- Explain the impact of formal register on classroom practices.

Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe strong voice as a technique for adjusting speech and body language to maximize student attention.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations about register and body language. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teachers to learn more about how the observed register and body language influence student engagement. Lastly, students are asked to practice the delivery of instruction or classroom management using appropriate register and body language and reflect upon the impact on student engagement.
