| Rationale/ Summary | Continuing education and long-term professional growth come in many modalities from various types of organizations. In the United States, in Texas, and in your community, there are organizations dedicated to providing opportunities for teachers to improve their skillsets and promote professional growth for teachers. Opportunities and organizations vary – some provide content knowledge on specific subjects, others provide workshops dedicated to pedagogy, classroom management, and some offer scholarships, exchange programs, or even specialized certifications. The reasons to participate in these programs also vary for individual teachers. Today, students will research and explore different types of professional learning organizations and opportunities in order to identify specific organizations or opportunities that fit their long-term professional goals and skillsets. | Continuing education and long-term professional growth come in many modalities from various types of organizations.

| Lesson Preparation | Prior to the lesson, have the Fulbright Teacher Exchanges homepage pulled up and ready to show students how to navigate through the various parts to fill them in the chart. Have student devices ready to use. |  |
| 4 mins | Bellringer Using your notes from yesterday, how does continuing education support teacher success?  What are some ways teachers receive continuing education courses? | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Bellringer Review   T: Turn to your neighbor and answer the first question: Using your notes from yesterday, how does continuing education support teacher success?  S: (Turn and talk.)  T: Would anyone like to share their neighbor’s response?  S:   Teachers stay up to date on new research on how students learn Teachers stay up to date on emerging technology skills for the classroom Teachers interact/learn about new curriculum and resources Techers connect with other teachers to promote effective collaboration Teachers develop new skills and strategies  Teachers can refine their existing skills  T: Turn to your neighbor and answer the second question; What are some ways teachers receive continuing education courses?  S: (Turn and talk.)  T: Would anyone like to share their neighbor’s response?  S: Professional Development, Conferences, Higher Education courses  T: Teachers participate in continuing education for the same reasons they participate in long-term professional growth opportunities. There are many locations teachers are able to do this and professional learning organizations are one way. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Professional Learning Organizations and Professional Growth Opportunities T: Yesterday, we discussed continuing education and why is it important to a teacher, how they are able to participate in continuing education opportunities, and what those opportunities look like. Today we are going to continue this conversation and extend it to long-term growth opportunities and the organizations that offer them.  T: We will first define the term “Long-term professional growth.” (Project vocabulary with PowerPoint.) S: (Write vocabulary word.) T: Look to your student guide and go to the chart in the notes section. Fill in your chart as I read aloud the questions and responses. T: What are Professional Learning Organizations? (Project responses with PowerPoint. Read aloud as students write.)  S: (Student responses in green in the student guide. Write responses.)  T: What are Professional Learning Opportunities? S: (Student responses in green in student guide. Write responses.) T: Where are Professional Learning Organizations? S: (Student responses in green in student guide. Write responses.) T: Why do teachers use/seek them? S: (Student response in green in student guide. Write responses.)  T:  What are some examples of organizations and opportunities? S: (Student response in green in student guide. Write responses.)  T: How do today’s lesson and yesterday’s lesson connect with each other?  S: It is part of growth mindset – that teachers are always improving their skills and their abilities. Yesterday we learned why it is required of them because teachers should not remain the same because students don’t remain the same. But we learned that it also helps keep teachers up to date, it helps teachers improve, it helps teachers help students, etc.  T: Please write down a few points that you just heard below your chart and what I am going to say. Today we are learning about opportunities and organizations for growth because a teacher should participate in their own growth and want to learn more for themselves, not just because it is required.  T: Long-term professional opportunities can look very different for different organizations. There are many benefits to participating in long-term professional growth opportunities – but the most important is to find professional growth opportunities that fit the interests and needs of the individual teacher. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 8 mins | Model: Researching Professional Learning Organizations and Long-Term Professional Growth Opportunities  T: Today, we are going to search and identify Professional Learning Organizations and Long-Term Professional Growth Opportunities those organizations can offer. I am going to help you navigate through using the Fulbright Exchange Webpage as an example. Before going through the steps, please review the Example Chart in your student guide and what information you will be looking for.   S: (View example chart on student guide.)  T: You are identifying:  If the organization is local, state, or national; The name of the organization and sharing the website; The mission statement; Programs they offer; Requirements for the programs  Remember to keep in mind opportunities you are interested in.   T: In your Student Guide, I have provided for you a few different ways to find and research institutions, including the TEA approved organizations, and ways to search in google. Right now, I am going to show you what exactly you are looking for on the website once you identify the organization.   T:  I am opening the Fulbright Teacher Exchange home page website. (Show students the Mission Page, the Program Page, select a Program, and navigate through the website to the requirements. Demonstrate where to put this in the chart.)   S: (Following along the website and their chart.)   T: You have an example of a local, state, and national organization. Identify as many as you can in the time you have. You do not have to find one for each one – the goal is to find ones which are of personal interest to you and long-term growth. Are there any questions?  S: (Students ask clarifying questions if needed.)   T: Take a few minutes to search for organizations right now following the search methods I provided. Try to identify one or two that interest you.   S: (Search using search methods in student guide.)  T: (Monitor student search and answer questions.) | Student Guide Fulbright Exchange Webpage |
| 10 mins | Practice:  Researching Professional Learning Organizations and Long-Term Professional Growth Opportunities  T: You have ten minutes to fill in the research table with a few options. Please raise your hand if you have any clarifying questions during the activity. You have ten minutes, you may begin.  T: (Set ten-minute timer.) S: (Begin filling in research table.) T: (Circulate and monitor student activity and questions.) T: You have five minutes.  T: You have two minutes. |  |
| 4 mins | Debrief  T: What organizations or opportunities did you find that were interesting to you? How would it be useful to long-term growth? S: Student responses will vary but may include:  S: I found a few social studies organizations offering conferences I think are interesting. I particularly liked an organization that teaches about the Holocaust and offers trainings for teachers. I think this would help me be a stronger teacher to know more about a subject that interests me and to be able to teach interesting things to my students and enrich their knowledge.  S: I found the National Board Certification. This would help me earn not only have the acknowledgement of being a teacher that is special, but also provides more money and helps me focus on my own growth.  T: What do you notice about these organizations? Are they all the same or are they different? S: They’re all different! And they offer different things. And that’s so teachers can individualize to their own interests or needs of growth.  T: Why are these organizations and opportunities important to professional growth? S: They help teachers improve and become better at their practice. | Student Guide |
