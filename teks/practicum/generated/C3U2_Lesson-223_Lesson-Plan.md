Now, you are going to use the information you gained from the interview to help you develop a professional development plan for how you will attain your professional growth goals.  T: It is also important for a teacher to think about how they will know if the goal has been met. A teacher must consider how they will track their progress toward their goals, the evidence they will use to determine if they have met the goal, and how they will know whether their performance has impacted instruction and student achievement.   T: To develop your plan, you will need to think about the following questions:  SMART Goal – What are your goals? What do you want to achieve? Actions - How will you accomplish the goal? What strategies and resources will you use to attain the goal?  Evidence of Goal Attainment - How will you know your goal has been met? How will you know whether it has impacted instruction and student achievement?  T: Your professional development plan should include the following success criteria:  At least 2 professional growth goals A cohesive plan to attain each goal A plan for how you will track progress toward each goal throughout the year.
