Notes: Roles of Local Government in Education in the United States



Structure of Local Government in Education

A school site is a single school. Its leader is a principal.


A school district is a unit of several schools. Its leader is a superintendent. School district office staff provide support to schools.


A local school board provides governance and oversight of education. Local school board members for school districts are elected while board members for charter schools are appointed.
