## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Transfer Ownership

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Identify and describe strong System Cues.
- Plan and implement a System Cue to replace explicit directions and narratives.
Purpose: The purpose of these tools is for students to observe how System Cues can empower students to execute directions independently, allowing the teacher to focus on instruction.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of classroom directions, sectioned by rows for Explicit Visible Directions, Directions with Fewer Words, and System Cues. It also provides conversations starters for students to use with their field site campus teachers to learn more about how System Cues create an environment in which students are empowered to execute directions with a high degree of independence, thereby allowing the teacher to focus their energy on facilitating learning. Lastly, students are asked to practice planning and/or implementing System Cues, discuss feedback from the field site campus teacher, and reflect upon the experience and impact on teaching and learning.

Connected Instructional Practice TEKS:
- Standard 7: The student creates an effective learning environment. The student is expected to: (A) describe and implement a safe and an effective learning environment that incorporates the principles of universal design; (C) demonstrate teacher and trainer characteristics that promote an effective learning environment; (E) identify classroom-management techniques that promote an effective learning environment.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 13:  The student participates in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.
