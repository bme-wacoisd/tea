### Educational Philosophy: Teachers’ core beliefs about learning and teaching.

- “I believe that all students are special and need a teacher that focuses on their individual needs in a safe and welcoming environment. I want to create a classroom where students can learn and explore to reach their full potential. My goal is also to create a warm, loving classroom, so students feel safe to make mistakes and show up as their full selves.”
- “My teaching philosophy focuses on centering students in the learning environment and allowing them to show up as their whole selves. I like for them to be active in their learning. I also want parents to be partners in the learning process and look for ways to keep them involved in helping me develop independent learners who love learning.”
