Date:
Objectives:
Identify and analyze the use of the Universal Design for Learning guidelines in a lesson.
Evaluate the impact of using the Universal Design for Learning guidelines on learning.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe the Universal Design for Learning Guideline of providing multiple means of action and expression to support learning for all students.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the field site campus teacher uses the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines to provide multiple means of action and expression during instruction. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students practice planning and/or implementing an instructional activity that provides multiple means of action and expression.

|  | Universal Design for Learning Guideline:  Provide Multiple Means of Action & Expression | Examples | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Options for Physical Action | Provide alternative ways for students to interact with instructional materials and their environment | Provide flexibility with time, pacing, and range of motor action required to interact with instruction materials. Allow students to type an essay instead of writing it by hand. Provide multiple ways for students to respond, compose, or select material |  |
| Options for Physical Action | Provide access to and support with tools and assistive technologies | Teach alternate keyboard commands for mouse control. Allow customized overlays for touch screens and keyboards. Model the use of assistive technologies and accessibility tools |  |
| Options for Expression & Communication | Provide opportunities for students to communicate using multiple forms of media. | Ask students to solve problems using a variety of strategies. Allow options for students to communicate through text, speech, drawing, music, comics, dance, video, etc. Offer physical manipulatives, such as blocks, base-ten blocks, 3D models |  |
| Options for Expression & Communication | Allow students to use tools that complement the learning goal | Use sentence starters or sentence strips. Use spellcheckers, grammar checkers, text-to-speech software, calculators. Use story webs or concept maps |  |
| Options for Expression & Communication | Provide differentiated levels of support and scaffolds to support independent learning | Provide feedback that is customized to the individual learner. Provide access to mentors, such as another teacher or tutor. Provide models and scaffolds that can gradually be released |  |
| Options for Executive Functions | Support learners in setting challenging and authentic goals | Provide prompts and scaffolds to estimate effort, resources, and difficulty. Provide scaffolds, models, examples, and checklists. Post goals, objectives, and schedules in a visible location |  |
| Options for Executive Functions | Support learners in developing reasonable plans for reaching their goals | Provide planning templates and checklists. Provide coaches or mentors to model the planning process. Guide students in breaking long-term goals into attainable short-term goals |  |
| Options for Executive Functions | Provide flexible tools and processes to support organization and memory | Provide graphic organizers and templates for organizing information. Provide checklists and guides for note-taking |  |
| Options for Executive Functions | Support learners in analyzing their growth over time and built on it | Provide specific, timely, and actionable feedback. Ask questions to prompt self-assessment and reflection. Use work samples that show a student’s progress over time |  |
