S: Mr. Massey already has a Texas certification in special education since he has taught in a public school for five years, so he does not need any additional certifications to teach in a charter school.

T: Who can tell me about another school model and describe their requirements for teachers?  S: Charter schools require a bachelor’s degree, teacher certification for only some areas, and a background check.   T: Great, what about the last model?
