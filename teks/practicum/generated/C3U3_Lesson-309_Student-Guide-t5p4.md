Reading Passage #1:
Do Everything: A Handbook for the World’s White Ribboners, 1895

An all-round movement can only be carried forward by all-round advocates. . .. Our WCTU is a school. . .. Here we try our wings that . . . we may calmly take our places and prove to the world that what it needed most was two heads in counsel as well as “two beside the hearth.” When that day comes, the nation shall no longer miss as now the influence of half its wisdom, more than half its purity and nearly all its gentleness, in courts of justice and halls of legislation. Then shall one code of morals—and that the highest—govern both men and women; then shall the Sabbath be respected, the rights of the poor be recognized, the liquor traffic banished, and the home protected from all its foes.

Reading Passage #2:
Maple Tree by Tracie Vaughn Zimmer, 2005

There’s no doubt
where our street
found its name:
the gigantic maple tree
in front of Jamie Hamlin’s house.
His nose may run
green slime all year,
but he shares
the stale chocolate bars left over
from his family’s corner store
and besides,
like I said,
there’s his tree.

With my sketchbook
and colored pencils,
I climb
the four largest limbs
into my tower,
the perfect place to draw
what I see:

Mary Anne and Emily
swinging higher and higher
their hair like two flags
in the wind.

or
Paul and Carrie O’Brien
practicing karate moves
before their four o’clock class.
From my tower 30
I can see
the whole neighborhood.
But no one can see me,
hidden by these green and paper leaves,
creating sketches
from a spy tree.

Plunkett of Tammany Hall by George Washington Plunkett, 1905

My party’s in power in the city, and it’s goin’ to undertake a lot of public improvements. Well, I’m tipped off, say, that they’re going to lay out a new park at a certain place. I see my opportunity and I take it. I go to that place, and I buy up all the land I can in the neighborhood. Then the board of this or that makes its plan public, and there is a rush to get my land, which nobody cared particular for before. Ain’t it perfectly honest to charge a good price and make a profit on my investment and foresight? Of course, it is. Well, that’s honest graft.
