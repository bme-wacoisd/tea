Consider lessons that you observed from your field site work.
- Where have you seen examples of students engaging in conceptual understanding and procedural fluency?


Why is balancing conceptual understanding with procedural fluency important when teaching math using RBIS?

Examples: Math Tricks and Misconceptions




Practice: Math Tricks and Misconceptions
In the younger grades, we sometimes inadvertently teach misconceptions to students by telling students “rules” for math. These rules often fall apart as you progress into higher grade levels. For each example below of a “rule” taught in younger math grades, discuss why the rule will expire in older grades and produce at least one idea of how you could help students who have a misunderstanding about the concept.




| Problem | Concept | Trick | Why does it fall apart later? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15.98 x 100 |  |  |  |
| 7 – (-10) |  |  |  |


| Examples of “Rules” | Why will the rule expire in older grades? | Ideas of how to help students with misunderstanding about the concept. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multiplication and addition always increase amounts. |  |  |
| Division and subtraction always decrease amounts. |  |  |
| You cannot subtract a larger number from a smaller number |  |  |
| Always divide the larger number by the smaller number |  |  |
| Using the phase “reducing fractions” instead of asking students to simplify fractions. |  |  |
