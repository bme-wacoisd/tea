## Slide 8

### Exit Ticket

- Consider your own field experience during your classroom visits. What examples of UDL strategies have you seen your teacher (or other teachers) use?
- Mr. L is teaching his fourth-grade math students how to add decimal numbers. The students are doing well with the content. Therefore, as an in-class activity to show their mastery, Mr. L asks students to write their own word problem using decimals and demonstrate how to solve the problem. How does this assignment meet the criteria for UDL guidelines? How does it not? What else could Mr. L do to make this assignment more accessible for all students?
