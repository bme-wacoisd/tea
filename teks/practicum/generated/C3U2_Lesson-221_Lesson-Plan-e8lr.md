| 4 mins | Bellringer: Complete the anticipation guide to assess your knowledge of the professional growth process for teachers. | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share your response for each statement. If you are in an even row, your partner is the person in front of you.   S: (Turn and talk.)  T: (Quickly review responses to anticipation guide.) |  |
| 5 mins | Introduction to the Goal-Setting and Professional Development (GSPD) Process  T: (Share the following definitions via PPT as students record notes in student guide)  T:  The Goal-Setting and Professional Development (GSPD) Process is an on-going, recursive process where teachers reflect on current professional practices, identify professional growth goals, establish a professional development plan to attain those goals, and reflect on goal attainment.    T: This process is designed to help teachers:    reflect on their current professional practices identify their professional growth goals build their professional development plan to attain those goals  track their progress toward their goals over the course of the year  T: Developing a quality professional development plan (PDP) is an important part of this process.  A PDP is a detailed plan for how a teacher will attain their professional growth goals and track their progress toward the goals over the course of the year.   T: Quality growth plans are developed using various data sources, such as classroom observations, performance measures, discussions from professional learning communities, lesson plans, etc.  T: Today, you are going to consider what it is you would like to do in the next five to ten years and learn more about what it might take to get to that point. | Student Guide PPT Information about GSPD Process |
| 10 mins | Personal Trajectory    T: What do you believe about education and the purpose of education? Take a few minutes to write down your philosophy in your student guide. Use the following sentence starters to help guide your thinking.  To me, the most important role of a teacher is to… I believe an important purpose of education is to…  S: (complete philosophy of education).  T: Now, think about where you see yourself in two to five years. What you would like to teach. What age group would you like to work with? Is there a particular subject you want to teach? Do you want to pursue a specialization like high-needs special education, literacy specialist, math specialist, bilingual specialist? Take a few minutes to consider what you are interested in teaching and record those thoughts in your student guide. Use the following sentence starters to help guide your thinking.  I am best suited to work with students who… because… I am best suited to work in a school that values… because… I am most interested in teaching (subject and/or grade level) because… In five years, I want to be/have…  S: (Record thoughts in student guide).  T: Lastly, I want you to think about your role in education beyond five years. Do you want to pursue a master’s or doctorate degree? Are you interested in teaching in college or outside of the country? Do you want to be a principal someday or work at the district office? Take a few minutes to consider where you might want to be in ten years from now and record those thoughts in your student guide. Use the following sentence starter to guide your thinking.  In ten years, I want to be/have...  S: (Record thoughts in student guide).  T: Why is it important for an educator to consider what they want to accomplish long-term and short-term?  S: It helps you plan how you can continue to grow in those areas and what you need to do to get to that point.  T: Right – teachers continue to learn and grow well after they are certified. There are many and varied opportunities to improve your knowledge and practice and having goals and a plan will help you continue to improve and grow throughout your career. | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Goal Development  T: Now that you’ve identified what you would like to do in the field of education over the course of the next five to ten years, we are going to use the information to draft SMART goals.   T: SMART is an acronym for goal setting that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely. To create a SMART goal, a teacher must consider the following questions:  Specific - What do you want to accomplish? Measurable - How will you know when your goal is met? Achievable	- What steps can you take to reach your goal? Relevant - How will meeting this goal benefit you and your students? Timely – What is the end date for your goal?  T: Let’s look at an example.  T: Kia has been teaching for five years. She frequently uses cooperative learning in her classroom but would love to learn some new strategies to effectively manage groups. Kia develops two drafts of a goal to address this need.    T: Which goal represents a SMART goal?  S: The second goal because it provides more detail about what Kia wants to accomplish, how she will achieve the goal, and how this goal will help her and her students.   T: Let’s look at a few more examples of SMART goals.  Goal: I will obtain my digital teaching and learning certificate by the end of the school year to explore new instructional strategies to enhance teaching and learning through a more personalized and flexible approach.  T: Is this a SMART goal? How do you know?   S: Yes – the goal is specific and detailed. The goal can be attained and measured. The goal is relevant and provides a timeframe.   T: Let’s look at another goal.  Goal: I will learn new teaching strategies.  T: Is this a SMART goal?  S: No – the goal is not very detailed about what type of strategies the teacher wants to learn. It doesn’t provide insight into how the strategies will be used and doesn’t indicate a timeframe.    T: It is important that we develop goals that are SMART to ensure that goals are focused and to increase the likelihood that they will be achieved. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice   T: Think back to what you said you wanted to teach and where you wanted to be in the next five to ten years. Develop two professional learning goals that will help get you to where you said you wanted to be.   S: (Students draft two SMART goals).  T: On a sticky note, I would like for you to write down one of your goals and place it on your desk.   S: (Write one goal on a sticky note).  T: You are now going to engage in a gallery walk to discover your classmates’ goals.  S: (Gallery Walk)  T: Did you notice any goals that were similar to yours? How can you support one another in reaching your goals?  S: Student responses will vary. | Student Guide Sticky Notes Chart Paper |
| 3 mins | Debrief  T: What was challenging about developing your own goals?  S: Student responses will vary.  T: Why is it important for educators to engage in the Goal-Setting and Professional Development process?  S:  The process allows the educator to work on improving in areas of their interest or need.  Teachers continue to learn and grow well after they are certified. By allowing educators to develop their own plans, they are more likely to be invested in completing them because they can control the learning, timeframe, and outcomes. Having goals and a plan will help them continue to improve and grow throughout their career. |  |
