| Rationale/ Summary | Using the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators as a guide, students will consider various ethical scenarios, identify whether specific behavior is ethical and, if not, how the teacher could have better responded. | Using the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators as a guide, students will consider various ethical scenarios, identify whether specific behavior is ethical and, if not, how the teacher could have better responded. | Using the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators as a guide, students will consider various ethical scenarios, identify whether specific behavior is ethical and, if not, how the teacher could have better responded. |
| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Why is it important for a teacher to be familiar with the code of ethics rather than relying only on their judgement of what is best for students? Reflecting on all the scenarios discussed across our discussion of teacher ethics, what are two common situations where teachers can face ethical dilemmas?  What can you do to try to prevent these situations from happening?  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Why is it important for a teacher to be familiar with the code of ethics rather than relying only on their judgement of what is best for students?

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  A teacher is concerned about several of her students who are learning English as a second language. They are falling behind in class and becoming frustrated. She speaks with a representative from a local tutoring program. The program is free and offers quality after-school tutoring for students struggling in reading. The representative asks for more information about the students, including their recent state test scores. The teacher has reservations about sharing this information but decides it's in the student's best interest.  Is this teacher acting ethically? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Review: T: Who can share their responses to the bellringer? S: No. by sharing student test scores, she is violating confidentiality rules. Student test scores should not be shared with anyone, especially someone that is outside the school/student’s family. | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Instruction: Responding to Ethical Dilemmas T: As you saw in our bellringer today, teachers can sometimes find themselves in a situation in which they think they are doing the right thing for students, but they are acting unethically. It is important for teachers to recognize when these situations present ethical dilemmas and make a decision that is professional and appropriate.  T: We have examined different scenarios over the last few class periods to help us understand examples and non-examples of ethical behavior. To this point, you have simply identified unethical behavior. Today, you will have the opportunity to put yourself in the shoes of a teacher facing an ethical dilemma and decide what that teacher should do to take the ethical path.   T: First, let’s consider a few guiding principles for teachers when seeking to act ethically. Please make note of these in your participant guide. They should consider: Am I thinking objectively? (Is my judgement being clouded by any emotions or biases?) Is this currently a violation of the educator code of ethics?  Could it somehow violate the code of ethics in the future?  T: Sometimes what a teacher believes to be in the students’ best interest conflicts with ethical behavior as described in the code of ethics. Let’s consider the example from last class’s exit ticket, found in your student guide. Can someone quickly summarize the situation Mr. Carlos finds himself in?  S: Mr. Carlos shared his personal contact information with a student, and they are having non-school related conversations.  T: Do you think Mr. Carlos thought this was in the student’s best interest?  S: Yes, it’s important Thomas knows information about school and tutoring.  T: Based on the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators what should he have done differently?  S: Communications between students occur through school-approved accounts, about school-related topics.  T: At what point could Mr. Carlos have made a different decision that would have helped him avoid this situation?  S: When it became clear Mr. Carlos needed to communicate with Thomas outside of school, he should have only communicated with Thomas through his school email.   T: Sometimes people may make decisions that seem harmless in the moment but can later snowball into ethical issues. Mr. Carlos likely did not intend for the texting conversation to go beyond school related topics, but now he has found himself in a challenging situation because he chose to use his personal phone and email. All due to a simple mistake. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 9 mins | Ethical Dilemma Jigsaw  T: We will now split into six groups with each group responsible for a different scenario. You will examine the scenario using the focus questions found in your student guide. Once you have analyzed the scenario and developed a plan of action for the teacher, one member of each group will present the scenario and the plan to the rest of the class. While only one student is presenting, all members of each group must have responses to the focus questions in their student guide so that it can be used as part of your portfolio. Are there any questions?  S: (Questions may vary)   T: Remember, there could be multiple valid responses to each scenario. | Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Ethical Dilemma Jigsaw Discussion T: Each group will now share their scenario and suggested teacher response. Each group’s designated speaker will read their scenario aloud and then share their responses to the guiding questions. If your group is not presenting, please ask questions or provide feedback on each group’s proposed responses. After each group shares, the rest of the class will have the chance to rate the group’s suggested approach using the following protocol: a thumbs up if you agree with the approach a thumbs down if you think the decision is still ethically questionable a thumb in the middle if you are unsure Remember, there could be multiple valid responses to each scenario.  T: (When students vote on if the response is appropriate, call on students that disagree or are unsure to explain their rationale) S: (Student groups will each present their ethical dilemma and provide their response. The audience will ask questions and provide feedback to their proposed teacher response.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: We’ve talked a lot the last few days about teacher ethics. Why is it important that teachers are ethical?  S: {Write what the students should say.}  T: What do you think are the easiest pitfalls for teachers that may put them into ethically questionable situations?  S: There are many things teachers may do with good intentions that can be ethically questionable. Ex: texting with students about class, talking about student issues and data or data with colleagues, giving students a ride home, etc.   T: How can teachers avoid these situations?  S: Teachers can ask themselves if an action could lead to an unprofessional outcome now or in the future. When in doubt, they can refer to the code of ethics. | Student Guide |
