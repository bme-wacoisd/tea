| Lesson Preparation | For this lesson, you will need to print the  TEA CPE Guide or have it available on devices for students to use during the Model. Additionally, there are five scenarios which will need to be printed and put around different locations in the room for the station activity in Practice.   Be prepared during the lesson to share some of your positive professional learning experiences. This is a great opportunity to model what it looks like to be a lifelong learner. |  |
| 4 mins | Bellringer John is 15 and wants to be a lifeguard. John meets the minimum age and swimming requirements, but now must take a 26-hour course to become a lifeguard where he will learn First Aid to help someone if they have an injury, CPR to help someone who cannot breathe, and the skills necessary to save a life. At the end of the course, he will take exams on CPR/First Aid, and an exam to test his knowledge in order to become a certified lifeguard. John becomes a lifeguard and passes all his exams. If he wants to remain a lifeguard after two years, he must pass all the exams again and he will continue to take them every two years after that. This is important to the safety of swimmers and patrons at the pool.  Why do you think John is required to take a 26-hour course to become a lifeguard? Why do you think John must pass the exams every two years? Why is it important to swimmer safety?  Can you think of any other professions that require a person to have a certification or a license? Do these professions require you to take courses and ‘keep-up’ your license? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Debrief   T: Turn to a partner and discuss the scenario and the questions.   S: (Turn and talk to partner.) T: Why do you think John is required to take a 26-hour course to become a lifeguard? S:  John can swim but he does not know all the skills necessary to save someone or how to perform CPR or First Aid. In the course is where he learns these things and learns skills specific to his job.  T: Why do you think John must pass the exams every two years? Why is it important to swimmer safety? S:   He must take it every two years, so he doesn’t forget and because how to do CPR or to give first aid changes all the time and it is constantly improving.  It is important to swimmer safety so that he remembers what it is and how to do it because it is the best for them that he knows.  T: What are some other professions that require certification or licensure? S: Doctor, lawyer, pilot, personal trainer, swim instructor, teacher T:  Do these professions require you to take courses and ‘keep-up’ your license? S: Yes! | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Continuing Professional Education T: As we discussed in the bellringer, many professions that require you to have a license also require you to ‘keep-up’ the license through taking courses or taking certification exams. These are meant to keep you up to date on the most current knowledge and to help you be successful.  (Provide examples of personal positive professional development experiences.) Teaching is a profession that requires you to keep up your license through continuing education courses. In Texas, a teachers must participate in “Continued Professional Education” or CPE. We will first review two vocabulary words.    (Project vocabulary and notes.) T: Please write the definitions for Continuing Education and Continuing Education Credits in the “Vocabulary” section of your student guide.  S: (Write definitions in student guide.)  T: We will now take notes on Continued Professional Education. Please follow along with the PowerPoint to fill-in “Notes: Continuing Professional Education.” What is Continuing Professional Education?  S: (Write definition.) T: How do teachers receive CPEs? S: (Write definition.)  T: How do CPEs support the success of teachers?   S: (Write student responses in green in student guide.) T: Where do teachers complete CPEs? S: (Write student responses in green in student guide.) T: Take a moment to view the TEA CPE Guide provided by the Texas Education Agency. It describes CPEs and the guidelines for teachers on the different CPEs they should take. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 8 mins | Model: Importance of Continuing Education Activities   T: Using the CPE Guide, you will answer a few questions to understand the requirements necessary for a teacher to receive continuing education credits. CPE activities can vary and can be on various subjects and can come from a variety of sources and activities. With a partner, answer the two questions: What are specific themes and topics for continuing education requirements? And what are acceptable CPE activities?  S: (Work with a partner to answer the two questions.)   T: What are the specific themes and topics for continuing education requirements?  S: Student responses my vary but may include:   S: Content area knowledge and skills, professional ethics and standards of conduct, education for students with learning disabilities.   T. What are acceptable types of CPE activities?   S: Student responses my vary but may include:   S: Participating in institutes, workshops, seminars, conferences, interactive distance learning, video conferencing, online activities, and in-service or staff development activities given by an approved provider or sponsor.   T: Before we begin the practice activity, let’s review: where do teachers receive CPEs?   S:  School districts and open-enrollment charter schools TEA State Board for Educator Certification  Accredited institutions of higher education recognized by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). This includes out-of-state institutions of higher education recognized by the THECB. Regional education service centers (ESCs) Registered TEA Providers  T: With this knowledge, let’s read the example scenario to understand how you will apply this knowledge in the practice activity scenario.   (Project scenario with PowerPoint.)  T:  A group of Special Education teachers take a professional development workshop together at their school to learn more about the Response to Intervention (RTI) method to identify students with disabilities and provide appropriate support. It takes place over two days, and they are excused from teaching those two days. This professional development is provided by their school district and is approved by TEA.   S: (Read silently along with teacher.)   T: Each scenario you will read, you will need to answer two questions:   1) Is this an approved Continuing Education Activity? Explain your rationale. 2) How does this Continuing Education Activity lead to teacher success?   T: I am going to look at my notes and come to the portion of “Where do teachers receive CPEs?” and look for to see if this scenario is approved. According to this list, it is – because it is provided by a school district. I am now going to look at the end of the TEA CPE Guide and see that it is a workshop. My answer is:  Yes, it is an approved activity because it is provided by a school district and is an activity listed in the TEA CPE guide. It is a workshop.   S: (Read response.)   T:  This second question can be answered both in your notes and the TEA CPE Guide. I am going to look to the list of reasons and identify a reason. I am also going to look to the first page of the TEA CPE Guide and look for different requirements.   T: From the list of reasons, it includes developing skills to teach students. And from the CPE Guide, it is part of their knowledge area of curriculum. My answer can be simple, it is:  This provides content area knowledge and skill development. | Student Guide TEA CPE Guide |
| 10 mins | Practice: Importance of Continuing Education Activities  T: There are five stations with five separate scenarios.  Using the TEA CPE Guide provided in the Student Guide and the notes you took in class to assess each continuing education scenario.   With each scenario you will want to answer the following questions: 1) Is this an approved Continuing Education Activity? Explain your rationale. 2) How does this Continuing Education Activity lead to teacher success?   Each station has one scenario. You will have two minutes at each scenario to read and complete the questions.   T: Scenarios will be about teachers who are seeking growth or continuing education opportunities.   T: You will have two minutes at each station. If you finish at the station before the time is up, strengthen your response by providing more explanation or elaboration. I will alert you when to rotate. I will count you off 1 through 5. Begin at the station coordinating with your number.   T: (Count students. Point them to their station.)   T: You may begin.   T: (Set timer and project it on the board.)   S: (Go to station and begin reading the scenario and answering the question.)   T: (Keep track of time and tell students when to rotate at two-minute mark.)   S: (Rotate to next station and read scenarios.)   T: Time is up. Please remain at your station and be prepared to share out a response. | TEA CPE Guide |
