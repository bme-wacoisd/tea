### Lesson 3.08: Evidence-Based Writing

Name:
Date:
Read the scenario and identify the strengths of the teacher’s assignment, as well as one way the assignment could be improved.
Ms. A asks her students to read a diary entry written by a soldier who survived the bombing of Pearl Harbor during World War II. After student read the diary entry, they respond in writing to a question about how the Japanese were able to inflict so much damage during the attack.
What are the strengths of Ms. A’s assignment?
She asks the students to use a text to provide evidence for their answers. Reading the diary entry and writing about it will help the students understand more than just reading it.
Is Ms. A.’s prompt an example of evidence-based writing? Why or why not?
Yes, because the students use the diary entry to write their answers to the question.

Read the following writing prompts. Determine if each prompt is evidence-based or not and circle the correct choice. Explain how the evidence-based prompt promotes accessibility and fairness for all students.
- Prompt #1: Did the colonists express their unhappiness with the Stamp Act in peaceful or violent ways?
Evidence-Based Prompt			Not Evidence-Based Prompt
- Prompt #2: Think of a time when you were unhappy about something someone told you to do. How did you respond?
Evidence-Based Prompt			Not Evidence-Based Prompt

- How does the evidence-based prompt promote accessibility for all students?
Prompt #1 is based on what students would learn in a social studies class. If they all learned the same information about the Stamp Act, they all can answer the question successfully. With Prompt #2, students may have had lots of different experiences with being unhappy and respond in different ways. We don’t know if each student can answer this question or will answer it in the same way.

Describe a time when you have seen a teacher ask a student to complete evidence-based writing. What was its effect in the classroom?
Responses will vary.
