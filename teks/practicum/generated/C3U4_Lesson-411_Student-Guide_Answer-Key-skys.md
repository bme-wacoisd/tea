### Lesson 4.11: Just-In-Time Supports for Acceleration

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:
Ms. L teaches Algebra 1. This week, she is introducing the slope-intercept form linear equation: y = mx + b. She feels confident that her students will be able to understand the terms and graph examples but is concerned that a few of her students have struggled to solve for an unknown variable in an equation. Once students need to solve for x, some of them will not be able to complete the assignment.
She decides to provide a targeted review of how to solve for unknown variables in an equation during her school’s study hall block the day before the lesson and asks the students who have the most difficulty on this topic attend. By providing this support, nearly 90 percent of her students were proficient on her exit ticket the following day.

1. Describe how Ms. L set her students up for success using the terms “acceleration” and “just-in-time interventions.”
Ms. L saw that her students did not have all the skills necessary to engage in her grade level content. She decided to use acceleration, instead of remediation, to help them catch up while still teaching them grade level content. She provided a just-in-time intervention to help her students review how to solve for a missing variable so that they could better understand how to use the slope intercept linear equation.

Instruction: Planning Effective Just-In-Time Interventions Notes




Practice 1: Applying the Steps of Just-in-Time Interventions for Acceleration
Mr. H is in his fourth-year teaching second grade. This year, he wants to be more intentional about using just-in-time interventions to support students with engaging in grade level content. Follow along with Mr. H as he completes the steps to developing a plan for his just-in-time interventions and respond to the questions along the way.

Step 1: Identify Prerequisite Skills and Knowledge
Mr. H first needs to identify the prerequisite skills and knowledge his students need to master his upcoming unit on Addition and Subtraction of Length Units. Using the following standards and assessment results, identify which prerequisite skills and knowledge Mr. H. should focus on with his Just-in-Time Intervention.

- Based on the standards above, what foundational concepts should students know to be successful on the 2nd-grade content?
Students should be able to measure the lengths of objects using measuring tools. They should also know that when you put these units together end to end, you can find the length of an object.

- Why is it important that a student can do this before moving onto grade level content?
If they do not understand that you can measure an object using units, they may not understand how to use inches or centimeters as standard units of measurement to find the length of an object.

Based on his analysis of the standards, Mr. H provided a pre-test that includes the following questions:
Source: Eureka Math, Grade 1, Module 3 Assessment.
In his class of 18 students,
- 17 students were able to correctly compare the units to identify student’s preferred vegetable.
- 12 students were able to correctly identify what pictures had the correct measurements in centimeter cubes.

- Given the results of this assessment, what concept should Mr. H focus on with his just-in-time intervention? How many students should be in this intervention group?
Some students need support in standard 1.7B and 1.7D, how to use same sized units to units to measure objects using units and describe a length using the nearest whole unit. Six students should be in the intervention group for this concept.


Step 2: Schedule within the Scope and Sequence
Mr. H uses the Eureka Math curriculum provided by his district. These high-quality instructional materials provide the following overview of the topics and objectives featured in this upcoming unit.

- Based on the sequence of topics and objectives provided by Mr. H’s high-quality instructional materials, at what point should he provide this just in time intervention (A, B, or C)? Explain your choice.
Mr. H should provide this intervention at point A. The first objective requires students to use multiple copies of the same unit to measure objects, so he should provide this intervention prior to this lesson. B and C are too late.


Step 3: Design and Implement Appropriate Interventions
To ensure his students get the most out of his just-in-time intervention, Mr. H’s needs to know how the skills in his intervention connect to the grade-level content his students are learning. Examine the Unit assessment question for the end of this unit below.

Source: Eureka Math, Grade 2, Module 2 Assessment.
- How does the content of his intervention connect to the grade level content his students must master?
To succeed in this content, students must be able to use a ruler and a paper clip to measure the ribbons. They are using two different units of measurement to compare lengths of ribbons. For students to understand this, they must understand how units can be used to measure things (centimeters vs paperclips.)

Mr. H found the following math problems from the first-grade curriculum that he can use to support his students in reviewing the foundational skills within his just-in-time intervention.
Source: Eureka Math, Grade 1, Module 3 Assessment.
- Which problem do you think best helps students access the grade level content shown in the unit assessment question? Explain your reasoning using the sample unit test question above.
Question C, because it is the only one that uses units to measure the length of something. This is a skill students must master to know how to use paper clips or a ruler to measure the ribbon in the above question.
