## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Rigorous Tasks

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Evaluate the impact of cognitive engagement on learning
- Identify and analyze how tasks can be designed to cognitively engage students and require effortful thinking.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe how rigorous tasks cognitively engage students.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the field site campus teacher cognitively engages students with rigorous tasks.  It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher.t.  Lastly, students o practice planning and/or implementing a rigorous task for cognitive engagement.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lessons 4.08:  Engaging Students in Authentic and Rigorous Tasks
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 4: The student understands the learner and the learning process. The student is expected to: (A) relate and implement principles and theories of human development to teaching and training situations; (B) relate and implement principles and theories about the learning process to teaching and training situations; (C) demonstrate and implement behaviors and skills that facilitate learning.
- Standard 5:  The student interacts effectively in the role of an educator. The student is expected to: (A) demonstrate effective interaction skills with stakeholders such as students, educators, parents/guardians, community members, and other professionals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

| How do rigorous tasks require students to cognitively engage with the most important content? |  |
| What happens when students are no longer attending to information? |  |
| Why is passive listening the least likely to cognitively engage students? |  |
| What were students physically doing during a recent learning task? |  |
| How did a recent learning task help students think deeply about the content? |  |
| How might a recent learning task  be modified to ensure students are more cognitively engaged? |  |

| Questions | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| Why would instruction that requires only listening without the expectation of any other action by a student, run the risk of losing student attention? |  |
| What happens when students are no longer attending to information? |  |
| How does critical thinking and effortful thought help students build on and extend prior knowledge? |  |
| How do open-ended questions provide space for multiple student interpretations? |  |
| How does the communication of understanding and comparison of ideas build on and extend students’ prior knowledge? |  |
| If applicable, reflect upon and describe the experience of planning and/or delivering a rigorous task. |  |
