Consider lessons that you observed from your field site work.
- Where have you seen examples of students engaging in conceptual understanding and procedural fluency? Responses will vary.
Why is balancing conceptual understanding with procedural fluency important when teaching math using RBIS? Rigorous math includes conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and application. Students need to be able to explain the why behind the math and think flexibly, as well as be able to conduct calculations quickly and accurately.

Notes: Conceptual Understanding-The Problem with Math Tricks
The Pitfalls of Using Math Tricks or Shortcuts
Creates gaps in conceptual knowledge in later grades.
Math tricks tend to “fall apart” or “expire” in later grades because they only work in specialized situations.
Students do not understand the rules of properties of numbers.
Students cannot explain why behind the math.

Examples: Math Tricks and Misconceptions


Practice: Math Tricks and Misconceptions
In the younger grades, we sometimes inadvertently teach misconceptions to students by telling students “rules” for math. These rules often fall apart as you progress into higher grade levels. For each example below of a “rule” taught in younger math grades, discuss why the rule will expire in older grades and produce at least one idea of how you could help students who have a misunderstanding about the concept.




| Problem | Concept | Trick | Why does it fall apart later? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15.98 x 100 | Multiplying by powers of 10 | Move the decimal to the right when multiplying by 10 | Students move decimals arbitrarily without understanding why, numbers get larger and more complex in later grades |
| 7 – (-10) | Subtracting negatives increases the amount | “Keep, add a line, change the sign” | Problems get more complex, and it is easy to lose a negative sign or forget to change a sign; students have no sense of whether their answer makes sense or not |


| Examples of “Rules” | Why will the rule expire in older grades? | Ideas of how to help students with misunderstanding about the concept. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multiplication and addition always increase amounts. | Multiplying by numbers less than one will lead to smaller numbers. Addition of a negative number can reduce amounts. | Utilizing a number line to show how numbers can decrease or diagrams to show decrease for multiplication. |
| Division and subtraction always decrease amounts. | Dividing by numbers less than one can increase amounts. Subtracting negative numbers leads to increases in amounts. | Utilizing a number line to show how numbers can increase or diagrams to show increase for division. |
| You cannot subtract a larger number from a smaller number | Negative numbers are introduced in upper grades. Students can subtract a larger number from smaller and get a negative. | Utilize a number line to teach the concept of negative numbers. |
| Always divide the larger number by the smaller number | Word problems in later grades may require students to divide larger numbers by smaller numbers to get numbers that are smaller than 1. | Use images or diagrams to show the context of the word problem to help students understand how to divide. |
| Using the phase “reducing fractions” instead of asking students to simplify fractions. | Reducing fractions implies that the number decreases in value when it stays the same. | Use multiple visual methods to show how fractions are equivalent. |
