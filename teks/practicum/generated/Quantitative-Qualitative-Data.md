### Tool Name: Quantitative & Qualitative Data

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
Identify quantitative and qualitative data collection methods.
Explain the value of a learner profile to a teacher.
Describe the purpose of qualitative and quantitative data collection in building a teacher’s knowledge of students.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe how quantitative and qualitative data about students can be used to support student learning.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of how the field site campus teacher collects, compiles, and uses quantitative and qualitative data to support student learning. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher. Lastly, students construct a learner profile and reflect upon the experience and implications for teaching and learning.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 3.11: Learning about Students Using Quantitative and Qualitative Data
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 4: The student understands the learner and the learning process. The student is expected to: (A) relate and implement principles and theories of human development to teaching and training situations; (B) relate and implement principles and theories about the learning process to teaching and training situations; (C) demonstrate and implement behaviors and skills that facilitate learning.
- Standard 5:  The student interacts effectively in the role of an educator. The student is expected to: (A) demonstrate effective interaction skills with stakeholders such as students, educators, parents/guardians, community members, and other professionals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

Reflect: Use the table below to guide your reflection on quantitative and qualitative data.


| Type of Data | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Quantitative: information that can be counted and expressed in numbers, answering questions like “how many?” and “how often?” |  |
| Qualitative: information that can be expressed as words, answering questions                                 like “why?” and “how?” |  |
