### Encouraging Productive Struggle through the Use of High-Quality Instructional Materials


| 1 | High-quality instructional materials ask students to engage with grade-level content, which ensures that there are high expectations for students to meet. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | High-quality instructional materials also give students opportunities to engage with the content in different ways. As we discussed in the previous lessons, one of the ways that students can struggle productively is by trying to solve problems in different ways. |
