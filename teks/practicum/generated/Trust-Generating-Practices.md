Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is to provide students an opportunity to maintain boundaries while building rapport with students.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of boundaries, trust, and rapport between teachers and students. It is divided into rows for boundaries and the five key trust generators. It also provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teachers. Students are to practice implementation of boundaries and trust generators during a check-in with a student. Students then reflect upon the impact on trust, rapport, and student learning.
