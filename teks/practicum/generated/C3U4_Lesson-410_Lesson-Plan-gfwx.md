| Rationale/ Summary | Math is a content area in which grade-level content builds on established skills and knowledge. Some concepts are virtually inaccessible for students if they have not mastered the previous content. This challenge requires teachers to use strategic and timely interventions to support students who are behind in math to engage in grade-level content. In this lesson, students will compare remediation and acceleration, and identify the impact of just-in-time interventions on student learning. | Math is a content area in which grade-level content builds on established skills and knowledge.

|  | This lesson introduces a project to be included as part of the practicum portfolio that requires students to plan and implement a just-in-time intervention in their internship class. Students will use the RBIS Math Intervention Portfolio Project document to capture elements related to planning and reflecting on the process.  This project will draw from the content of Lessons 4.10-4.12. Lessons 4.10 and 4.11 will provide students with the context of how teachers plan just-in-time interventions. Once the project is introduced in 4.10, students should begin having discussions with their cooperating teacher to ensure they are able to plan and execute the intervention. If students are interning in a class that does not provide math instruction, they should use the provided Sample Math Intervention Scenario.  Lesson 4.12 will help students analyze pitfalls that teachers face when designing math instruction, which they should consider as they plan their interventions. Students will need to draw from online resources or curricular resources provided by their cooperating teacher to create the materials for the intervention.  Lesson 4.13 will give students the opportunity to share their experiences with their peers. This intervention planning project can be stretched across multiple class periods to allow students time to prepare for the intervention and complete the reflection. Consider adding additional elements to support students in the development of the project at your discretion. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: John entered the second grade without having mastered all the first-grade math content standards. His second-grade teacher, noticing this same challenge for many students, spent much of the first few months providing remediation around first grade content before moving onto second grade math concepts. John was able to learn some of these first-grade concepts, but his teacher had to move quickly to address nearly 1.5 years of content in one school year. Unfortunately, he finished second grade with gaps in both first and second grade content.  Now he is entering third grade and his teacher saw similar challenges for many students in a pre-assessment to start the school year. What will happen if his third-grade teacher begins the year the same way his second-grade teacher did? Why? | Student Guide |
| 13 mins | Instruction 1: Remediation and Acceleration in Math Notes T: Today’s bellringer talks about John’s struggles with Math. What is John’s challenge?  S: He started off behind in math, and because his teachers spend so much time reviewing, he is never able to catch up.  T: What will happen if his third-grade teacher begins the year the same way his second-grade teacher did? Why?  S: If his third-grade teacher uses a significant portion of time at the beginning of the year reviewing first- and second-grade content, then they will not have time to teach all the third-grade content too, so John will finish third grade even further behind.  T: Throughout this unit, we have been discussing one of the biggest challenges of math instruction, how we support students in accessing grade level content when they may not have mastered the foundational concepts on which that content is built. As we learned our discussion of UDL, it is important to give students access to grade level content through the guidelines for engagement, representation, and/or action & expression.  T: One way to think through how we help students who have unfinished learning is through remediation versus acceleration. Locate these vocabulary terms in your student guide.  Remediation: Teaching content again to students who did not learn it the first time; filling in gaps Acceleration: Ensuring that students are taught grade-level content with supports to address past concepts or skills that students have not learned yet.  T: To help you understand this difference in approaches, let us examine an instructional calendar for a teacher who prioritizes remediation and one who focuses on acceleration. (Display calendars from PPT).   T: This visual shows two different fifth grade teachers’ classrooms. The dark gray bar represents fourth grade content, the light gray bar represents fifth grade content. With a remediation, the first quarter of the year is dedicated to remediation. This teacher thinks that students that have not mastered all the fourth-grade content cannot be successful with fifth grade content. The problem is that fourth grade content is taking up time that teacher should be spending teaching fifth grade content. What happens to the remaining fifth grade content?   S: Students do not learn it. Or if they do, the teacher must go quickly to cover all of it.  T: Let us compare this with the acceleration approach. What do you notice about the distribution of fourth grade content?  S: (Responses will vary but may include:) It is more spread out.  There is a little bit before every chunk of fifth grade content.  It does not take up as much time as the remediation approach.  Students still all get to engage with all the fifth-grade content.  T:  The biggest difference between traditional remediation and acceleration is that acceleration is based on ensuring that students receive the review and support alongside grade level content, not in place of it.  T: Please find the table in your student guide titled “Contrasting Remediation and Acceleration.”  S: (Locates table)  T: Let us dig a little deeper into the differences between these two. Remediation is often built on a deficit mindset—it assumes that students cannot learn grade level content unless they have mastered all the previous grade level’s content. Instead, teachers should hold high expectations for students while providing the supports to help where necessary.   T: Once again, the biggest difference is that Remediation can limit access to grade level content, whereas acceleration ensure that all students still get access to it.  T: Remediation can often focus on drilling students on individual skills, like your times tables, which may not always connect to the content. For example, do you need to multiply to understand how to tell time? Does struggling with two-digit addition and subtraction math facts stop you from understanding place value?  T: Acceleration sets high expectations, aligns the skills with grade level content and provides it exactly when it is needed to support student success. All students have imperfect knowledge of what came before. If a teacher stops instruction to try to address every missed skill, he or she risks making the problem worse by not giving student the opportunity to learn the grade level content.  T: Can someone volunteer to summarize what remediation is? Acceleration?  S: Remediation is where a teacher spends time before teaching grade level content trying to catch students up on what they did not learn the year before. This makes it so that students miss what they should be learning that year because they are trying to catch up.  S: Acceleration spaces out the interventions so that they are strategic and tie into what students are learning in their grade level content so that students can get support they need while still learning what they are supposed to in that grade. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 8 mins | Instruction 2: Just-in-time Interventions Notes T: The best example of an acceleration strategy is when a teacher provides just-in-time supports. Based on context clues, what do you think this term means?  S: Support for students that happens just in time, or right when they need it to be successful.  T: Turn back to the vocabulary section of your student guide and get this definition: Just-in-Time Interventions: Strategic Intentional and timely review or reteaching of foundational skills that contribute to success on grade-level content. T: The two most important words in this term are “strategic” and “timely.” These supports must be strategic in that they are based on student data and address content that students must know to succeed on the grade level content. They must be timely in that they happen immediately before students will use them. Why is it helpful to learn something immediately before you use it in another application vs long before? S: This is when this knowledge moves into working memory—when students can apply those concepts once they have practiced them. T: Let us look at a teacher that is using just-in-time supports. Can someone read the description of Ms. C’s approach under the “Just in Time Interventions Notes” section of the student guide?  S: (Reads description)  T: In pairs, take the next four minutes to examine the graphic outlining how Ms. C. approaches planning for her just-in-time interventions. Then, citing specific evidence from this graphic, note in your student guide how she is being both strategic and timely with her planning.  S: (Review graphic and answer questions 1 & 2)  T: How is this Ms. C being strategic?  S: Ms. C uses a pre-test to know what students need to know and analyzes data to plan her interventions. She also reassesses students to measure how impactful the interventions were.  T: What is she strategically doing with the students that do not need an intervention?  S: She is providing them with a next extension activity so that they are still practicing math skills.  T: How is Ms. C being timely?  S: Ms. C is beginning her interventions up to two weeks before the next unit, then does them alongside the grade level content by using the 30 minutes prior to the whole group lesson to support students in small groups. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice: Identifying Remediation vs Acceleration T: Take the next 8 minutes to review scenarios one and two to identify when a teacher is using remediation or acceleration by answering the accompanying questions.   S: (Complete the scenarios.)  T: Who can share their responses for scenario 1?   S: Mr. M is using Acceleration, while Ms. G is using remediation. I think Mr. M will have higher success rates throughout the year, including on the STAAR test because his students will be able to consistently access grade level content, while Ms. G is focusing on below-grade level content early in the year.  T: What about scenario 2?  S: Ms. P is most likely using remediation because her students are scoring lower on the latter units. This means she likely had to rush those last few units due to spending lots of time remediating at the beginning of the year instead of using just-in-time supports. Ms. V most likely used acceleration because her students are consistent in their proficiency rates across units. | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Debrief  T: Today we discussed Just-in-time interventions and how they are a useful tool for catching students up on missed content while still pushing them to learn grade-level skills and knowledge. As part of your portfolio, you will be asked to plan and, if possible, implement a just-in-time intervention in your internship classroom. This will require you work with your cooperating teacher to  Identify skills or knowledge that students need support with to master upcoming grade level math content. Select students for this intervention. Plan and implement a brief small group session that provides just-in-time support. T: If you are unable to do this in your cooperating teacher’s classroom, you will still be required to plan a small group math intervention and include it as part of your portfolio. (Provide students with the handout titled RBIS Math Intervention Portfolio Project. If students do not intern in a math class, also provide them with the Sample Math Intervention Scenario handout.) | Student Guide |
