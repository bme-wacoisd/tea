# Lesson-Sequencing


## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Lesson Sequencing

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Observe and reflect on how a lesson is intentionally structured to build student understanding.
- Observe and reflect on how learning is sequenced within a single lesson to build understanding.
- Rehearse and teach part or all of a lesson plan that is intentionally structured to build student understanding.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to observe the sequencing of lesson complexity, rehearse and teach part or all of a lesson plan that is intentionally structured, and to reflect upon the impact of sequencing on student learning.
Summary: Students are asked to observe a lesson and use a template to record field notes that align varying degrees of complexity with a study of how those concepts, skills, and tasks are ordered. Next, students rehearse and teach part or all of a lesson plan that is intentionally structured. Students should seek advice about any sequencing concerns in consultation with their field site campus teachers. Lastly, students will reflect upon the impact of both appropriate and inappropriate sequencing on student learning.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 6.06: Sequencing the Content of a Lesson
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 3: The student explores the teaching and training profession. The student is expected to: (B) summarize and apply pedagogical knowledge and skills needed by teaching and training professionals.
- Standard 6: The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) explain the role of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills in planning and evaluating instruction; (C) explain the rationale for and process of instructional planning components such as vertical alignment and scope and sequence; and (F) demonstrate lesson planning to meet instructional goals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and uses effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

Observe:  High-quality lesson plans are ordered so that learning builds from simple to more complex. Observe a lesson facilitated by your field site campus teacher and use the table below to record your field notes about the complexity of lesson components. Order the components with numbers in the sequence they are presented.

| Rehearsing and teaching part or all of a lesson plan that is intentionally structured to build student understanding. Evaluate the sequencing of complexity for each concept, skill, or task included in the lesson. Discuss potential sequence changes with your field site campus teacher by explaining your rationale for making a change. |  |


| Questions | Answers |

| What evidence do you have that the intentional sequencing of the concepts and skills in the lesson supported student learning? |  |
| What might be the impact of any of the sequencing changes that you discussed with the field site teacher? |  |
