## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Best Practices for Assessment

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Identify use of a variety of assessments in a lesson plan
- Analyze how different types of formative assessments are used in a lesson.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to observe formative assessment practices as a foundation of effective instruction.
Summary: The tool provides an observation section for students to track the progress of informal and formal assessments during a classroom unit. You should expect to see various informal assessments mapped (e.g., thumbs up, white boards, fist to 5, feedback on students’ verbal responses), as well as various formal assessments (e.g., practice sets, homework, exit tickets, fluency assessments, quizzes). Students are next encouraged to discuss with the field site teacher how the results of assessments may or may not have impacted their decisions. Lastly, students are asked to reflect upon the importance of assessments and how formal and informal assessments have differentiated purposes.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 5.03: Best Practices for Formal and Informal Formative Assessment
Connected Instructional Practice TEKS:
- Standard 3: The student explores the teaching and training profession. The student is expected to: (B) summarize and apply acquired pedagogical knowledge and skills needed by teaching and training professionals.
- Standard 6: The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (D) describe principles and theories that impact instructional planning; and (F) demonstrate lesson planning to meet instructional goals.
- Standard 8: The student assesses teaching and learning. The student is expected to: (A) describe the role of assessment as part of the learning process; and (C) analyze the assessment process.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and uses effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

| Formative Assessment | Formal or Informal? | What is Assessed? | Teacher’s Possible Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| True/False Bellringer | Formal | Prior knowledge and misconceptions | Speed up or slow down the pacing of the lesson. Specifically address misconceptions and skip information students already know. |
| Turn and Talk | Informal | Current group and individual understanding of main idea | Pacing, strategic grouping, and/or reteach or model another example |
