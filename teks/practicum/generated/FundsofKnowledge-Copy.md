Date:
Objectives:
- Identify different methods of discerning students’ funds of knowledge and consider the implications for teaching and learning
- Identify characteristics of asset-based teaching
- Identify practices that hold high expectations for all students and identify why holding high expectations is important to successful teaching
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is to provide students with the opportunity to observe how teachers can understand and use students’ funds of knowledge to connect the classroom to students’ lived experiences and enhance an asset-based view of students.  Funds of knowledge are the accumulated academic and personal knowledge that students bring to school that are a result of their social and environmental background and their life experiences.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of the use of students’ funds of knowledge to connect the classroom to students’ lived experiences, enhance an asset-based view of students, and design meaningful learning activities.  It provides conversation starters for students to use with their field site campus teacher.  Lastly, students reflect on the importance of funds of knowledge in instructional design.
