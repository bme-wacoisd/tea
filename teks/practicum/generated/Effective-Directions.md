## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Effective Directions

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Define and describe characteristics of effective directions and effective delivery of directions.
- Plan and implement clear directions based on the three criteria of effective directions.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to observe how the planning and delivery of effective directions contribute to the creation of a safe and effective classroom.
Summary: The tool provides a section for students to record their observations of effective directions, sectioned by success criteria rows. It also provides conversations starters for students to use with their field site campus teachers to learn more about how effective directions are planned and delivered. Lastly, students are asked to practice planning and/or delivering effective directions for an instructional activity, discuss feedback from the field site campus teacher, and reflect upon the experience and impact on teaching and learning.
Connections to Course II:
- Lesson 1.04 Planning and Delivering Effective Directions, Part I
- Lessons 1.05 Planning and Delivering Effective Directions, Part II
- Lessons 1.06 Planning and Delivering Effective Directions, Part III

Connected Instructional Practice TEKS:
- Standard 7: The student creates an effective learning environment. The student is expected to: (A) describe and implement a safe and an effective learning environment that incorporates the principles of universal design; (C) demonstrate teacher and trainer characteristics that promote an effective learning environment; (E) identify classroom-management techniques that promote an effective learning environment.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 13:  The student participates in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

| Characteristics of Effective Directions | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Specific: students are set up for success by the description of concrete actions |  |
| Sequential: complex tasks are broken into a series of simple actions described sequentially |  |
| Observable: directions are visible (i.e., “pencil to the page” versus “get to work”) |  |
| Effective Delivery of Directions | Evidence |
| Pace: speed at which one talks |  |
| Cadence: rhythm of speech |  |
| Pitch: Highness or lowness                                               of a sound |  |
| Volume: loudness or quietness                                 of a sound |  |
| Tone: Inflection of speech                                     that indicates mood |  |
| Body Language: nonverbal communication through gestures and movement |  |

| Design and/or deliver specific, sequential, and observable directions for an instructional activity using the components of effective delivery listed below. It is encouraged that the student uses the curriculum already used by the field site teacher, and it is not the expectation that the student makes it up themself. |  |
