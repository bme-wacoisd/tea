| Rationale/ Summary | Stress is a human response to the stimuli in our lives. An abundance of distress can cause teachers to become overwhelmed in their jobs and experience burnout. For this reason, it is important for the students to understand how to identify stress in their professional lives and how to cope with that stress in ways that are healthy and improve their overall wellbeing. | Stress is a human response to the stimuli in our lives.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Create a concept map about what you believe would be stressful about the teaching profession. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Distress vs. Eustress T: Turn and talk with a partner about the concept map you created. In one minute, we will come back together and create our own concept map on the board. S: (Turn and talk for one minute). T: Let’s combine our concept maps into one. If we add something to our class map that was not on yours, add it as we go along. S: (Share out concept map ideas.) T: (Create a whole-class concept map on the board. Answers will vary but may include: virtual teaching/teaching during the pandemic, grading, classroom management issues, difficulties with parents, navigating colleagues/work relationships, time management, work-life balance, etc.) T: Stress is how our body and mind respond to challenging situations. Most of us think of stress as a negative thing, but all forms of stress are healthy to some extent.  T: Some stress is negative. Taking a test you haven’t studied for, forgetting to wash your jersey the morning of a big game—these are things that might cause negative stress. We call this kind of stress distress. Distress is stress that often negatively impacts your mental, emotional, or even physical health. T: Some forms of stress are good for you. For example, starting a new job, getting accepted to college, or getting a new puppy can cause stress—but it’s a type of stress that is generally positive. This is called eustress and is a type of stress that can help you achieve your goals and move you forward.  T: It is important to know the difference between distress and eustress because both are present in our personal and professional lives all the time. Teachers experience both forms of stress, and if these stresses are not balanced, they are less likely to be happy and successful in their job.  T: Was the stress you described in your concept map primarily distress or eustress? S: Answers will vary, but it is likely most indicated distressful situations. T: What are some positive/eustressful situations you think teachers may also experience? S: Answers will vary. T: It seems like there are a lot of things we could be stressed about, both positive and negative, in the teaching profession. What are some negative effects this may have on a teacher if they are unable to manage their stress? S: Answers will vary, but could include: teacher burnout, deciding to leave the profession, falling behind with work requirements (such as grading, communicating with parents, etc.). | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Managing Stress and Setting Boundaries T: The negative effects you mentioned are some of the reasons why it is important teachers learn to manage stress. What are some things you do to manage stress? S:  Answers will vary. T: Stress management techniques look different for every person because people will use different strategies to cope with those things which cause them stress. What do you think are some healthy ways people deal with stress? S: Answers will vary, but could include:  Exercise Getting enough sleep Talking to a friend Craft/hobbies Spending time with pets/animals Outdoor activities Volunteering T: What are some unhealthy ways that someone might deal with stress? S: Answers will vary, but could include:  Not eating/overeating Not getting enough sleep Substance use (such as smoking) Not asking for help Fighting/arguing with others T: Using healthy stress management techniques help teachers, too. When teachers experience stress at work, they often bring that stress home with them. It can impact their workday as well as their life at home, which conflicts with their work-life balance. One of the ways that teachers can ensure a better work-life balance is to establish clear boundaries to which they hold others accountable.  T: What do you think boundaries look like for teachers? S: Answers will vary, but could include:  Establishing due dates and enforcing them Limiting communication with parents, students, or colleagues after school hours or on weekends Not brining papers home to grade/limiting work done from home Only volunteering for extra duties when they have time/not overbooking their schedule T: We’re going to review a couple of scenarios to see how these strategies may play out in real life and discuss healthy stress management strategies and boundaries. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Scenarios T: In your Student Guide, find the section that says, “Practice 1: Scenarios.” In a moment you will work with a partner to read through the scenarios and fill in the graphic organizer with recommendations for how the teacher should manage their work-related stress. You’ll have five minutes to review the scenarios together, and then we will share out.  T: (Use your classroom routine to sort students into pairs.) T: (Allow five minutes to pass.) T: Let’s review the scenarios. What was the stress Mrs. Powell was facing in Scenario #1? S: She was moved from sixth grade to eighth grade. T: Why would that be stressful? S: Answers will vary, but may include:  She has to learn a new curriculum. She will need to adapt to working on a new team She might need different classroom resources She may have to change her classroom routines or procedures for older students T: What suggestions would you give Mrs. Powell when considering the stress she is facing? S: Answers will vary. T: Mrs. Powell’s situation can be stressful in both good and bad ways. Teaching a new curriculum on a different team, even within the same school, can give a teacher anxiety because they do not know what to expect. Sometimes, though, change is exciting and can actually lead a teacher to be excited about a new beginning. Mrs. Powell can use self-care techniques to adapt to the negative stress as well as the positive stress. T: Let’s look at Scenario #2. What was the stress Mr. Stewart was facing? S: Parents have begun calling him at home after school hours and on weekends to ask questions about assignments. T: Why would that be stressful? S: Answers will vary, but may include:  He might feel like he never gets “off work” Interferes with family time A lack of respect/privacy T: What suggestions would you give Mr. Stewart when considering the stress he is facing? S: Answers will vary. T: When it comes to managing stress as a teacher, setting clear boundaries really matter. Mr. Stewart needs to let parents know what hours he will be accessible through phone, email, and in person. This boundary is good for his mental health because he can separate work from home and have a better work-life balance. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice 2: Article Jigsaw T: Next, we’re going to read two articles about teacher stress that we’ll discuss in groups of four T: (Using your classroom routine, move students into groups of four.) T: Count off in the group so that one group member is 1, 2, 3, or 4. S: (Count off to get a number.) T: If you are an odd number (1 or 3), you will be reading “Teacher Stress and Burnout.” If you are an even number (2 or 4), you will be reading “Teacher Stress During the Pandemic.” That means two people in each group should be reading the same article. Does everyone know which article they’re reading? S: (Respond.) T:  In your Student Guide, find the graphic organizer titled, Article Jigsaw. I am going to assign you one of two articles to read. As you read your article, fill out the section of the graphic organizer for the article you are assigned T: Great. You’ll have five minutes to independently read the article and fill out the graphic organizer in your Student Guide. S: (Independently read article.) T: Now come together with the person who read the same article as you. Take five minutes to compare your notes and discuss how to explain the main points of the article to your other group mates. S: (Work with article partner to discuss graphic organizer notes.) T: Now that you’ve had the chance to discuss your article with your partner, the two of you will explain to your other group mates what your article was about. Make sure each group member gets to participate in the discussion. The odd number group will go first.  S: (Begin sharing out to group mates.) | Student Guide Article 1: Teacher Stress and Health  Article 2: Teacher Stress During the Pandemic |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Why is it important for teachers to recognize stress that might impact their professional life? S: Because if they are not aware of the stressors in their lives, they may not use healthy strategies for management and could end up getting burned out. T: Why is it good for students when their teachers can manage their stress? S: Because a teacher who is less stressed is going to create a learning environment that is less stressed for students.  T: What are some strategies you use to mitigate stress?  S: Answers will vary. T: There are many strategies that all of us use to recognize and deal with stress. The key is to find the stress management techniques that work for you, and to establish boundaries that respect yourself and others. | Student Guide |
