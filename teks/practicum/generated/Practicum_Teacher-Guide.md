Practicum in Education and Training
Curriculum Support Document
Practicum in Education and Training is a field-based course that provides students background knowledge of child and adolescent development principles as well as principles of effective teaching and training practices. In this course, students will work under the supervision of their Education and Training teacher as well as with exemplary education professionals who work directly with K-12 students for a practicum experience. During their practicum experience, students will use the skills learned in Instructional Practices to plan and direct instruction, develop instructional materials, assist with recordkeeping, and perform other duties of educational personnel.
This Practicum in Education and Training curriculum is divided into four thematic units, detailed in the table below. The lessons within each unit are designed to meet the expectations of the Education and Training Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for Career Development and Career Technical Education. The lessons within this course have been created for 45-minute class sessions but may be modified to best fit an individual teacher’s schedule, class size, or specific student needs. Additionally,  they include field observation tools which the student can use to document their experiences and assist in their understanding of the course material as it applies to real-world scenarios. The materials provided are editable and may be adapted by the teacher as they see appropriate.
Each teacher has a unique teaching style that will best suit their students and school. The materials provided in this curriculum are scripted as a source of guidance for all teachers. The script is designed to guide instruction, not read verbatim.
Principles of Education and Training Thematic Units

Summative Assessments:
There are no summative assessments for this course.
Field Experience Tools:
In this course, students will engage in a field-based practicum experience where they collaborate with a highly qualified teacher in a local school to observe instruction, assist with planning, and deliver instruction to individual students and small groups. These tools are designed for students to document their experiences and reflect on what they have learned. Each tool is developed to correspond with pedagogical and instructional strategies that were discussed in the Education and Training Instructional Practices course. The tools are themed by the major categories listed in the table below.

Lesson Outline
Each unit contains individual lessons which focus on a sub-topic within that unit’s theme. The lesson is broken down into separate documents which can be printed or shared electronically with students.
Bellringer: Each lesson begins with a bellringer activity. This is designed to give students a task which they can accomplish at the beginning of class each day to focus their attention on the topic. The bellringers are designed to take approximately five minutes. Each bellringer is in the Student Guide, and answers can be accessed through the Student Guide Answer Key.
Lesson Plan: The lesson plan is designed to provide structured guidance for teachers in completing the student activities. The lesson objectives, corresponding TEKS, materials needed, and a scripted guide are provided in this document. There may also be supplemental materials available for download, such as lesson plan samples, also noted in the lesson plan document.
Student Guide: The Student Guide is a document designed for students to answer questions and keep track of their daily tasks. The blank Student Guide should be shared with students either electronically or printed. It is recommended if students are using printed copies of these materials that they develop a notebook so that they can return to the documents later. There is a teacher version of each Student Guide that provides an answer key for the bellringer as well as the student activities for that lesson.
Exit Ticket: Each lesson ends with an Exit Ticket that teachers can use as a formative assessment for that lesson. The Exit Tickets vary in formatting depending on the activity being completed for that lesson but are multiple choice or short answer questions. There is a teacher version of each Exit Ticket that provides an answer key.
Slide Deck: An outline slide deck is available for each lesson. Some lessons will not require a full presentation, so each deck may vary. These materials may be used as-is, but teachers are encouraged to use these deck outlines to create engaging presentations.



Material Personalization
Texas is a large, widely diverse state with over 1,200 school districts. For this reason, it is not possible for any one curriculum to be personalized to reflect every district and their unique culture, communities, and geographic location. Teachers using this curriculum are welcome to make adaptations to the materials to best meet the students’ needs. Below are some examples of ways teachers might change these lessons to make them more reflective of their school community.
- Changing the names of teachers and students, who are often referred to throughout the curriculum through pseudonyms such as “Ms. A” or “Student B.”
- Editing the slide decks to match a school theme or a classroom preference. For example, a teacher may want to use school colors, animations, or images from the areas surrounding their own school to help students connect to the content.
- Using real-life examples and age-appropriate stories from the teacher’s own perspective to connect students to the real world applications of the content.
Common Instructional Practices
Each lesson has been carefully designed to include high levels of rigor while engaging students in relevant discussions, creative problem solving, collaborative group work, and hands-on learning experiences. The following table describes some of the instructional strategies implemented in the lessons provided. Teachers may choose to change the structure of activities to fit class size or schedule. ,.


Frequently Asked Questions
I only see my students for a limited number of hours per week. How can I adapt my pacing?
Each lesson is designed to be 45 minutes in length, but we understand that many schools have 90 minute class periods or block schedules which do not allow for meeting every day. For that reason, please pace these lessons as you need. For example, if you have a 90 minute course, you could teach two lessons at one time or add extension activities to a particular topic if you felt it would benefit your students.
I have a mixed group of Principles and Instructional Practices students. Which curriculum do I use?
It is best practice to look at the learning objectives, TEKS, and requirements for each course to best determine how to use the materials for Principles and Instructional Practices. There may be opportunities for overlap between topics which can help with that instructional decision making.
Who do I contact if I have questions?

| Type of Instructional Practice | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Classroom Observations | Students are provided opportunities to observe teachers within and outside of their school, with guidance as to the classroom “look fors” that they will be observing. This gives students opportunities to see quality instruction in action, and to analyze teaching practices based on what they are currently learning. |
| Data Analysis | Data analysis provides students with the opportunity to review facts, statistics, and relevant research in an unbiased way to draw their own conclusions from information and use their critical thinking skills to support their conclusions. |
| Direct Instruction | Direct instruction should be used to engage students and prepare them for the independent or group activities in which they will participate. For the purposes of this course, direct instruction is used in a dialogue format between teachers and students to include them in the learning process and provide proper scaffolds to help students with understanding. |
| Gallery Walk | When working individually or in groups, gallery walks are often utilized to help students get a snapshot of the work done by others in their class and encourage discourse around the information/outlook that different groups shared. |
| Guided Reading | Guided reading practices allow the students to engage with material that may be new to them, as well to break down reading materials that may be more challenging, such as technically written or primary source documents. |
| I Do-We Do-You Do | This strategy is frequently used to model to students what is expected, especially when introducing material that is complex. In this strategy teachers will model what his expected, then guide the whole group together through that practice, and then lastly will provide students with an opportunity to independently practice the skill when they are ready. |
| Interviews | Students will conduct interviews with education and training professionals to gain insight into their experiences in the profession. Most interviews are highly structured but do provide opportunities for students to create their own interview questions (relevant to the content) which may be of interest to them. |
| Jigsaw Activities | Jigsaw activities are designed to break up large amounts of data, research, or learning goals to chunk learning. Using this practice,  students are given the opportunity to master a specific portion of the content being introduced, then teach that portion of learning to a group who have mastered a different potion of the learning objective. This activity requires collaboration as well as communication and promotes student ownership of learning. |
| Lesson Plan Analysis | Students will be given samples of high quality instructional materials to analyze based on the topic being discussed (such as essential questions, alignment to objectives, etc.). All lesson plan samples are provided through curricula that have been approved by the Texas Education Agency (TEA). |
| Panel Discussions | Teachers are encouraged to invite community members and education and training professionals to participate in panel discussion in their classroom. These discussions can be held in person or virtually and should include opportunities for students to create questions that they would be interested in learning about. |
| Portfolios | Students will develop a professional portfolio which includes artifacts such as student work samples, a philosophy of education, resumes, cover letters, scholarship applications, etc. |
| Project Presentations | Students will be asked to present individually or in small groups on topics throughout the course. These presentations are guided through a rubric which provides success criteria for the student and aid in grading for the teacher. |
| Reflective Journal Entries | Students will be asked to reflect on their own learning experiences, both inside and outside of school. These reflective journals should remain between the student and teacher, and no student should feel obligated to share personal or sensitive information. |
| Role Playing | Role-play scenarios help students to practice a particular skill or concept in a low-stakes environment. All the role-play scenarios in these lessons contain guidance on how to implement the role-play, and some are fully scripted. |
| Student-Guided Research | Students will be asked to use resources (online, print materials, etc.) to research specific topics. For these activities, guidance is provided on the types of resources students should utilize, but teachers may use discretion based on school policy. |
| Think-Pair-Share | The Think-Pair-Share is used for group/partner discussions that allow each student to provide their own insight into a problem of practice or question posed to the whole class. Students are encouraged first to think of their own response (and write that response down), partner with one student or a group of students, and then share their ideas individually. |
| Turn and Talk | The Turn and talk method is most effective for quick discussions between partners. This strategy is used frequently to debrief formative assessments, such as bellringers, or to get students quickly engaged with a topic by providing questions that they can easily answer. |
