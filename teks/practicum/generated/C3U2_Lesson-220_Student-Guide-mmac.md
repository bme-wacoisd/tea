### Lesson 2.20: Systems for Professional Growth

Name:
Date:
Bellringer
Directions: Referring to your assignment from Lesson 2.18 to interview a teacher about their PD experiences please answer the questions below:
What are some examples of how the teacher you interviewed participated in professional development?





How does professional development support a growth mindset?

Notes: School and District-Based Systems for Teacher Growth

Model: Teacher Growth Activities
SAMPLE: Springfield School District of Professional Teacher Growth Opportunities
Springfield School District’s System for Professional Teacher Growth aligns with objectives for student growth. The goal is to improve student outcomes and learning and encourages more teacher collaboration in order to do so. Review some examples of activities and descriptions of those activities.


What do you believe is the purpose of these activities?





Practice: Teacher Growth Activities
Directions: In the activity below, review the different scenarios and suggest the best activity which would help fulfil the areas of growth for the teacher. You are assuming that the school and school district have a system that supports teacher growth through the four following activities: Professional Learning Communities, Peer Observation, Action Research, and Lesson Study.
Define the activity and how it would look, explain your rationale, how it will help teachers, and how it will help students.
Hint: There is a best answer for each example, but the option you choose is correct if your rationale is correct.





| Ways to Grow Professionally as a Teacher | Ways to Grow Professionally as a Teacher | Ways to Grow Professionally as a Teacher |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Continuing Professional Education (CPE) | Long-Term Professional Growth | School and District-Based Systems for Teacher Growth |
| CPE is the Texas equivalent to Continuing Education. It is required for all Texas educators holding a standard teaching certificate. The appropriate number of clock-hours of continuing professional education (CPE) must be completed during each five-year license renewal period.  Classroom teachers must complete 150 CPE hours. | The process by which educators gain new skills, seek opportunities and career experiences to continuously improve their practice and knowledge to benefit both their short and long-term goals. | Schools and districts create different programs and activities to help teachers grow as practitioners, to learn new or refine current skills and knowledge of practice and enable capacity building. It is the commitment to improving. |

| Activity | Description of Examples | Benefits to Teachers and Students |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Professional Learning Communities | Springfield High School promotes PLCs to help teachers in the same subject areas learn what the others are doing in their classrooms and share best practices. The math teachers meet on the second Tuesday of every month in the afternoons for an hour. Each PLC has a leader who leads it and chooses the theme for the session. | Teachers say the PLCS have helped them improve their classroom skills and improve the delivery of lessons and information to students. |
| Peer Observation | Teachers complete two observations per year—one in which they observe another teacher, and one in which they are observed by a peer. In one observation, teachers identify an area of growth for themselves and are paired with observing a teacher who demonstrates strength in this area.  In another observation, teachers ask for feedback from an observing teacher on a specific area of focus, such as classroom routines. |  |
| Action Research | Teachers are encouraged to use action research in their classrooms to implement new strategies or studies. Teachers first read research on an instructional practice. They then design an informal study to monitor the impact the practice has on student learning.  A group of elementary math teachers agree that their students have difficulty with explaining their work on word problems. After reading articles on possible causes and solutions, they engage their students in daily student-led discussions about problem-solving to determine the impact on student math vocabulary and students’ ability to explain how they solved a problem. They give a short assessment each week to identify the effect of the discussions. |  |
| Lesson Study | Four Algebra I teachers are teaching polynomials and decide to do a lesson study. They research instructional strategies, plan the lesson together, teach the lesson, observe each other, and then reflect on what students did well and did not do well. |  |


| Teacher Growth Area 1:  A new teacher has started in their first year at a new school, and they struggle with classroom management while giving notes and providing direct instructions – students are constantly talking and not able to pay attention to what the teacher is teaching. Their mentor teacher has suggested they should improve their skills for instructing students on behavior management. |

| Teacher Growth Area 2:  A teacher is hoping to encourage students to collaborate more in her classroom but is struggling to get them to do so. She has modeled for them several times different ways to collaborate and has taught lessons that give reasons for students to collaborate, but she finds that the students struggle. She participates in in a PLC monthly at her school but finds that is not helping. She has found a few different methods including changing the seating chart that research supports her need. |

| Teacher Growth Area 3:  Mr. Scott is teaching Chemistry and has noticed that his classes are not performing as well as they have in the past, and not as well as the other Chemistry teachers at his school. He has tried a few different methods in his classroom to engage students more but doesn’t seem to be getting different results. |

| Teacher Growth Area 4: Mrs. Holding is a new Social Studies teacher who wants to incorporate more literacy strategies into her class. She asked other teachers with whom she works if they have tried these methods or heard of them, and none of them had used them before. She wants to plan a lesson focused on incorporating new literacy studies she has read about, and wants to see if it brings the outcomes she wanted – did students demonstrate the required history content and literacy skill in the exit ticket? |
