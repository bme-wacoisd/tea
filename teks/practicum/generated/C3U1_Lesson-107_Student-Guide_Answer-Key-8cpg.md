Bellringer:
What are the minimum requirements to become a teacher in the state of Texas?
Teachers in Texas must have a bachelor’s degree and must be certified to teach by the state of Texas.


Why is it important that there are requirements and standards to become a teacher?
If there are requirements to become a teacher, anyone could do it and students could be taught by individuals that do not have the proper training and background to effectively teach students. If there were no minimum requirements, schools would not be able to make sure they are hiring the right people to teach.

Practice 2: Teacher Pathway Scenarios

Examine the following scenarios to determine the correct pathway for each aspiring teacher.

Scenario 1: Dr. Fuller has PhD in chemistry and decided to become a classroom teacher. She is not certified but would like to become certified. Ideally, she wants to teach while going through the certification process to get some experience in the classroom and decide if it is right for her. Where can she teach?

Since she is not certified, Dr. Fuller can teach in either a private school or charter school, unless it is a charter or private school who determines that they want their teachers to be Texas certified.


Scenario 2: Mr. Fuentes recently graduated college with a degree in education and wants to teach English Learners (EL) at the charter school where he graduated high school. Is he considered qualified to teach in his desired school? If not, what steps must he follow to be qualified to teach in that school?

Since Mr. Fuentes wants to teach English learners, he must receive his state certification before he can teach in a charter school. To do that, he needs to enroll in a preparation program, pass his certification tests, and apply for certification. Once he does that, all he needs to do is pass a background check.


Scenario 3: Mr. Massey has been a special education teacher in Texas public schools for the last five years but recently decided to shift to a charter school. Is he considered qualified to teach in his desired school? If not, what steps must he follow to be qualified to teach in that school?

Mr. Massey already has a Texas certification in special education since he has taught in a public school for five years, so he does not need any additional certifications to teach in a charter school. He only needs to pass a background check.


Scenario 4: Ms. Price started her career as a kindergarten teacher in a private school, but recently decided she wants to teach in a public school. She holds a degree in education but is not certified. Is she considered qualified to teach in her desired school? If not, what steps must she follow to be qualified to teach in that school?

Ms. Price is not currently qualified to teach in a public school because she does not have her Texas teacher certification. She must: to enroll in a preparation program, pass her certification tests, and apply for certification and pass a background check.
