| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Students will read the following scenario and respond to the questions:  Scenario: Mr. J’s class is learning about cause and effect. Prior to starting the unit, he gave his students a pre-assessment to determine what they already knew about cause and effect. Based on the data, he had his students engage in several text-based activities using various sources to identify cause and effect relationships. At the end of the unit, he gives his students an assessment on cause and effect. He thought his students were going to do well, but many did not pass the test or show a basic understanding of cause and effect. What assessment types did Mr. J implement? Based on what you learned about assessments, what could Mr. J have done differently to ensure his students were learning the content throughout the unit?  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Students will read the following scenario and respond to the questions:  Scenario: Mr. J’s class is learning about cause and effect.

|  | This lesson may be a review for some students as assessment has been addressed in previous courses.  You will need examples of the four different types of assessments for students to review. Students will need to bring in examples of assessments from their field sites. |  |
| 3 mins | Bellringer:  What is an assessment? Why do you think teachers use assessments? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | T: Turn and talk with a partner about what you think an assessment is and why you think teachers use assessments. S: (turn and talk.) T: Who would like to share? S: Responses will vary but may include: an assessment is a test teachers give to see if you have learned what is being taught. Teachers give assessments so we have grades. Teachers use assessments to help them know what they may need to review. |  |
| 13 mins | Notes: Types of Assessments T: Today, we are going to discuss the different types of assessments. An assessment is any tool used to collect, analyze, and respond to information about student understanding of learning targets. S: (Write in vocabulary section of Student Guide.) T: As you may notice, an assessment is any tool used to collect, analyze, and respond to information about student learning. It does not have to just be a test.  T: Based on this definition, why do teachers use assessments? S: To learn about their students understanding and progress toward the learning targets. T: Right – Teachers use assessments to learn about how well their students are learning and to drive their instruction. Often, teachers need to use multiple types of assessments to get an accurate picture of what a student knows and can do.  T: (Project with PowerPoint and students record notes in student guide.) We are going to look at the different types of assessments used to guide reading instruction. T: Each of you brought in examples of assessments from your field site. As we discuss each type of assessment, I want you to look at the examples you brought in to determine what type of assessment they represent.  T: The first type of assessment is one that you are all familiar with – Summative Assessment. Summative assessments evaluate learning at the end of a learning sequence. They are used to determine to what extent students met the learning objectives. These types of assessments are considered evaluative.  T: What are some examples of summative assessments? S: STAAR tests, end of unit assessment for a class. T: Do you think these types of assessments are low stakes or high stakes? S: High stakes because they are state assessments or end of unit assessments that usually count a lot for a grade. T: Does anyone have an example of a summative assessment from their field site they can share with the class? S: Students share examples of summative assessments. T: The next type of assessment is an interim assessment. Interim assessments check progress throughout the year, identify areas for intervention, and predict performance on summative assessment. These are also referred to as benchmark assessments. T: Do you think interim assessments are high stakes or low stakes? S: Low stakes  T: Does anyone have an example of an interim assessment from their field site they can share with the class? S: Students share examples of interim assessments. T: Another type of assessment that is used much more frequently is formative assessment. Formative assessments determine understanding as learning is taking place and are used to help inform a teacher’s next steps. This type of assessment provides teachers with insight as to what immediate changes they need to make to instruction and/or unit plans. This type of assessment is often used multiple times throughout the day through exit tickets, checks for understanding, students practice, etc.  T: What are some of the different ways your teachers assess your learning throughout the day/week?  S: Exit tickets, essays, tests, quizzes, discussions, homework, etc. T: How are formative assessments different from interim or summative assessments? S: Formative assessments provide immediate feedback on what students know so the teacher can adjust the lesson right away.  T: Would formative assessments be considered high stakes or low stakes? S: Low stakes because they are used to check progress and help inform a teacher’s next steps. They are not always for a grade. T: Does anyone have an example of a formative assessment from their field site they can share with the class? S: Students share examples of formative assessments. T: The last type of assessment is diagnostic assessment. A diagnostic assessment determines student prior knowledge, strengths, and weaknesses in a particular area at the beginning of a learning sequence. This information helps to inform instructional plans to meet the needs of individual students. Pre-assessments, phonics surveys, and work samples are examples of diagnostic assessments often used in reading. T: Do you think diagnostic assessments are low stakes or high stakes? S: Low stakes because they are not used as a grade but are used to help inform a teacher’s instruction. T: Does anyone have an example of a diagnostic assessment from their field site they can share with the class? S: Students share examples of diagnostic assessments. | Student Guide PPT |
| 8 mins | Practice: Different Types of Assessments  Note: You may use different examples as you see fit.  T: (Share via PPT) I am going to show you various assessments and I want you to determine what type of assessment it is and the purpose of the assessment. You will write your answers in the Student Guide, under the section “Practice: Different Types of Assessments.”  T: (show sample of CORE phonics survey). What type of assessment is this and what is the purpose?  S: Diagnostic because it provides the teacher with information on a particular skill.  T: (show sample of unit test.) What type of assessment is this and what is the purpose?  S: Unit assessment – Given at the end of a unit to see what information students retained from the unit as a whole.   T: (show sample of exit ticket.) What type of assessment is this and what is the purpose?  S: Formative assessment because it provides information on what students learned during the lesson so the teacher can make immediate adjustments.  T: (show sample benchmark or interim.) What type of assessment is this and what is the purpose?  S: Interim assessment – gives information about what students have learned on a board range of learning standards.   T: Why are a variety of assessments necessary to guide reading instruction?   S: They each provide a different level of insight into what students’ strengths and weaknesses are and help support the teacher in planning instruction.  T: Which type of assessment informs a teacher’s instructional decisions and allows them to make immediate adjustments to their lessons?   S: Formative  T: Why is this type of assessment valuable?  S: It allows the teacher to provide immediate feedback to students and make corrections to misunderstandings right away. | Student Guide PPT Assessment #1 Source: https://www.pattan.net/getmedia/d39e59fb-4f56-47b2-b00b-21b15609098e/19.%20swerling_zachariah Assessment #2 Source: https://webassets.zearn.org/resources/G04M02%20Assessments%202016.pdf Assessment #3 Source: https://luckylittlelearners.com/all-about-math-exit-ticket-boards/ Assessment #4 Source: https://www.pdffiller.com/210648093-Original-Benchmarkpdf-kindergarten-benchmark-assessment-pdf- |
| 12 mins | Practice: Lesson Analysis  T: Now, you are going to work with a partner to review a lesson plan to see how the plan incorporates assessment to gauge student learning. As you find different types of assessments, label which type you think it is and why.  T: Are there any questions?  S: (ask questions as needed)  T: You will have about 10 minutes. You may begin.  S: (complete activity.) | Student Guide Grade 4, Unit 9, Lesson 1 |
| 2 mins | Debrief   T: What did you notice about the assessments in the lesson plan? S: Students were assessed throughout the lesson, not just at the end. T: What types of assessments did you find? S: Formative, diagnostic T: Why do you think formative assessments were the most prominent type of assessment in this lesson plan? S: Because interim and summative assessments are used at different points in the year, not daily. Formative assessments are used to drive instruction and make immediate changes, so they need to be more frequent. T: Correct – formative assessments provide insight into what students know, what they might be confused about, etc. so the teacher can make instructional changes right away opposed to finding out at the end of a unit or on an interim that students did not understand a concept or skill. |  |
