## Slide 3

### Bellringer

- Consider lessons that you observed from your field site work.
- Where have you seen examples of students engaging in conceptual understanding and procedural fluency?
- Why is balancing conceptual understanding with procedural fluency important when teaching math using RBIS?

### Vocabulary


| Research-Based Instructional Strategies (RBIS) | A set of practices supported by research that should be present in classrooms, regardless of instructional materials |
| --- | --- |
| Conceptual Understanding | The ability to access concepts from a number of perspectives and to see math as more than a set of mnemonics or discrete procedures. |
| Procedural Fluency | The ability to quickly perform mathematical calculations accurately. |

## Slide 5

### Problem #1

- 15.98 x 100 = ?
- Concept:
- Multiplying by powers of ten
- 5

---

## Slide 6

### Problem #1 Cont

- 15.98 x 100 = ?
- Concept:
- Multiplying by powers of ten
- Trick:
- Move the decimal to the right when multiplying by ten
- Why does it fall apart?
- Students move decimals around arbitrarily without understanding the why (multiplication rules)

## Slide 7

### Problem #2

- 7 – (-10) = ?
- Concept:
- Subtracting negatives increases the amount
- 7

---

## Slide 8

### Problem #2 Cont

- 7 – (-10) = ?
- Concept:
- Subtracting negatives increases the amount
- Trick:
- “Keep, add a line, change the sign”
- Why does it fall apart?
- When problems get more complex it is easy to lose a negative sign or forget to change a sign; students don’t know whether their answer makes sense or not

## Slide 9

### Exit Ticket

- Describe the pitfalls of teaching math tricks and shortcuts.
- Read the scenario below and determine if the teacher is using a trick or teaching conceptual understanding.  Explain your reasoning.
- Scenario: A math teacher is teaching students strategies for solving word problems.  She teaches students to look for keywords in the word problem to identify the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) that is needed to solve the problem.  She tells her students that when they see the words “more than” it always means that they should be adding.
