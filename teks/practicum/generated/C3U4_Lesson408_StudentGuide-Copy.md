How do I meet the different needs of my students AND teach the grade-level TEKS as they are intended?






Notes: UDL in Math


Practice 1: Guided Example
A 6th grade math class is working on the following TEKS:
6.4(B) Apply qualitative and quantitative reasoning to solve prediction and comparison of real-world problems involving ratios, rates, and proportions.
The teacher gives her students the following word problem: Jay was paid $190 for a job that required 40 hours of work. At this rate, how much should he be paid for a job requiring 60 hours of work?
Many of her students were successfully able to complete the word problem, but one student has unfinished learning as he has a hard time operating with fractions.

What should the teacher do?









Which approach do you think will most likely increase student understanding and promote more aecessible outcomes for all students?









Practice 2: Video Analysis
Watch a video example of a 1st grade math lesson to see how UDL is used throughout the lesson. As you watch, take notes on the different ways you see UDL practices being used to support student learning.

How did the UDL strategies named in the video compare to the UDL strategies you listed?




Are there other UDL strategies you would have used to make this lesson accessible to all students?



How could technology have been used to enhance the lesson?


Practice 3: Scenarios
Read each scenario. With your group, determine what the long-term impact for the student might be and what a UDL approach to this situation might look like.

| Scenario | Long-term Impact | What Might a UDL Approach Look Like? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Students in Mr. P’s 5th grade math class were given the following problem to solve.  A restaurant bill was paid equally by 7 friends. The bill was $99.96. How much money in dollars and cents did each person pay?  (STAAR End-of-Grade Assessment in Grade 5 Mathematics, 2022 Released Form).  Most of the students were able to complete the problem with ease, but one student really struggled with decimals. The teacher decided to modify the numbers in the word problem so that the student would only have to solve the problem using whole numbers instead of decimals. |  |  |
| Ms. M is teaching a lesson on subtraction using a number line. She talks to students about what a number line is, shows an example of a number line, and then shows a video about how to subtract using a number line. After the video, she gives her students a few problems to solve. |  |  |
| Ms. K’s 5th grade class has been learning about ecosystems to answer the question: how can trees support so much life? Students build an understanding of how energy flows in food webs by engaging in different activities, labs, and research to explore life surrounding and supported by a mangrove tree. Now, Ms. K wants to assess her students understanding by giving everyone a unit assessment. |  |  |
