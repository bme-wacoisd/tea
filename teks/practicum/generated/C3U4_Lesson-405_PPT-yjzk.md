### Productive Struggle: Do’s and Don’ts


| Do’s | Don’ts |
| --- | --- |
| Encourage students to work through the struggle by activating their prior knowledge. Support students to use multiple strategies to practice, refine, and revise their understanding. Encourage students to think aloud, write, and draw their ideas. Create an environment in which “embracing the struggle” is accepted and expected. | Create struggles for students that are not appropriate to the TEKS, the content being taught, or the student’s grade level. Productive struggle only occurs when students are striving to reach an achievable goal. Fail to provide supports for students to assist them through the struggle. Use discouraging language when students are exploring new avenues of thinking. |
