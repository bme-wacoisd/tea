| Rationale/ Summary | Teacher shortages are an increasing and complex problem in schools across the state and nation. Teacher shortages harm students, teachers, and the educational system. There are specific areas (for example, certain communities and content assignments) that are disproportionally difficult to staff. As students are learning more about teaching, it is important to ensure that students understand challenges within the field of education and how these challenges may impact teaching careers. | Teacher shortages are an increasing and complex problem in schools across the state and nation.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Respond to the prompts below:  Teacher shortages are a complex problem. Name at least two causes of teacher shortages.  Some teaching areas are disproportionally impacted by teacher shortages. Identify at least two areas that would be considered hard to staff. Name at least two short-term solutions and at least one long-term solution to address teacher shortages. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Respond to the prompts below:  Teacher shortages are a complex problem. Name at least two causes of teacher shortages.

| 2 mins | Bellringer Think about why teachers might leave the field of education. Write down 3-5 reasons. | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share your response. If you are in an even row, your partner is the person in front of you.   S: (Turn and talk.)  T: Do you think inexperienced teachers leave for the same reasons as experienced teachers?   S: Answers will vary but may include: Teachers leave because they are unhappy. I think both experienced and inexperienced teachers leave for this reason. Experienced teachers leave because they are retiring. Inexperienced teachers leave for other jobs that pay more or are less stressful. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Discussion and Notes: Teacher Shortages and Hard to Staff Areas T: The teacher shortage is real and increasing. A teacher shortage occurs when there are not enough teachers to staff open positions. The teacher shortage harms both students and other teachers. Students are without qualified professionals in their classrooms, and other teachers are often burdened with covering classes or teaching larger classes.   T: What do you believe would be another negative impact of not having enough teachers?   S: Teachers might leave the field of education because they are unhappy and feel overburdened.   T: Teachers who remain are less happy, and it leads to poor working conditions, which lead to greater teacher attrition. Teacher attrition is the rate at which teachers are exiting the field of education each year.  T: In addition to general teacher shortages, there are also areas that are considered hard-to-staff. Hard-to -staff areas are teaching categories (such as special education, bilingual education, mathematics, or science) in which there is an indication of multi-year data to indicate a teacher shortage. Even in the best of times, it is more difficult to find teachers to teach in these areas.  S: (Fill out first three rows of chart in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 24mins | Practice: Researching Teacher Attrition and Recruitment   T: We will research current hard-to-staff teaching areas, current teacher attrition rates, and what districts are doing related to teacher recruitment. Teacher recruitment is the efforts exhibited by schools and districts to attract qualified individuals to the field of education.   S: (Fill our final row of chart in Student Guide.)  T: As a part of your research, you will be attempting to answer the following questions:  Is there a current teacher shortage, and, if so, in what areas? Which areas would be considered hard-to-staff? What are the current rates of teacher attrition, and how do they differ across settings, urban, rural, suburban?  How are districts trying to recruit teachers?   T: In pairs, conduct research using the following websites and complete the graphic organizer in the Student Guide. You have 23 minutes to conduct your research.   T: (Set a timer for 23 minutes.)  S: (Access websites and record responses in the Student Guide.)  Teacher Attrition and Recruitment Research | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Let us take a minute to review your research.   T:  In what areas did you find there was a teacher shortage?  S: There are teacher shortages throughout the nation.  T: Which areas would you consider to be hard to staff?  S: Special education, math, and science are areas that are hard-to-staff.  T: What are the current rates of teacher attrition?  S: The rates are 8.4 in rural areas, 7.3 in suburban areas, and 7.9 for urban teachers.    T: What are ways that districts are trying to recruit teachers?  S: Districts are paying bonuses, creating grow your own programs, and hosting job fairs to recruit teachers.    T: What do you believe the impact of teacher shortages are having on education?  S: Teacher shortages affect us all. It is a real problem that a lot of people are trying to address. It not only affects us in our district or our state, but it is a nationwide issue. | Student Guide |
