### Lesson 3.07: Background Knowledge and Reading Comprehension

Name:
Date:
Read the following descriptions for two different 2nd grade lessons that focus on non-fiction text. Determine which is an example of a skill-based approach and which is an example of a knowledge-building approach.

Which approach is more likely to build students’ knowledge and vocabulary? Why?
Knowledge-based because students are learning about a particular topic, whereas in the skill-based approach, students are just learning about text-features.
How have you seen background knowledge incorporated in your own internship experience?
Student responses will vary based on internship experience.

| Scenario | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| The teacher teaches a mini lesson on captions and how they help students understand the pictures they accompany, including a think aloud of the connections she makes in her mind when she encounters a caption. Students then choose non-fiction books on different topics on their reading level and complete a graphic organizer where they identify each caption they encounter and what that caption explains about the picture. | Skill-based |
| The teacher conducts a read-aloud on a book about orcas. Throughout the read aloud, she pauses and asks questions about what they have learned about orcas during the reading. When she encounters a caption, she briefly explains what the structure is, explains that a caption explains a picture, and asks what the picture and caption help students understand about whales. Next, students read non-fiction books about other types of whales, completing a graphic organizer to capture key facts about the animals as they read. Students then include these facts in a writing assignment later in the lesson. | Knowledge-based |
