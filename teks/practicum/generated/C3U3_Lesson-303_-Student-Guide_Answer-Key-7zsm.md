### Lesson 3.03: Explicit Instruction Practice

Analyze the following scenario to determine if the instruction is explicit and systematic. Place checks in the boxes below to indicate if each criterion for explicit and systematic instruction is evident in the scenario. Then, explain how this scenario supports phonics instruction and explain where the instruction falls within the simple view of reading.

Mr. D is a 2nd grade teacher. In today’s lesson, he is going to introduce the sound /i/ for ‘Y.’ He begins the lesson by writing the letter ‘y’ on the board and asking students to produce the sound they learned for this letter. He reminds students that, in kindergarten, they learned the letter ‘y’ makes the consonant sound /y/. He writes words with the ‘y’ spelling on the board and asks students to read them with him. He then asks students if they notice any pattern as to the placement of the letter ‘y’ in these words. He points out that when the letter ‘y’ occurs at the beginning of a word or syllable, it represents the /y/ sound. Mr. D explains that today, they are going to learn a new sound associated with the letter ‘y.’ When the letter ‘y’ occurs in the middle of a word, it often represents the vowel sound /i/, not the consonant sound /y/. He has students say the sound /i/. Mr. D asks students to think of words containing the /i/ sound. As students offer words, he writes the words on the board, sorting them into columns according to the spelling used for /i/ and circles the letter for the /i/ sound in each word. He guides students in reading the list of words one at a time and points out that when the ‘y’ represents the /i/ sound, the letter occurs in the middle of a word or syllable. For practice, Mr. D provides students with an activity sheet where they must first circle the letter ‘y’ in each word pair, read each word in the pair aloud, and then decide whether the sound of the letter ‘y’ is the same in each word. As students complete the activity, Mr. D circulates the room to note which students are struggling with the concept of /i/ as ‘y’ and may need additional support. (Adapted from Grade 2, Unit 4, Lesson 3)

How does this scenario support phonics instruction?

This lesson teaches the relationship between letters and the sounds they represent. In this lesson, students learned about the relationship between ‘y’ and /i/.

Where does the instruction fall within the simple view of reading?

This lesson builds students decoding skills.



#### Practice 1: Video Analysis

As you watch the video, observe how well the teacher instruction aligns to the success criteria for explicit and systematic instruction and record notes in the chart below.



#### Practice 2: Role-play

In groups, you are going to role-play a portion of the lesson distributed in class.
Each group member will choose a section from the lesson plan to read and teach to the group. While the “teacher” is delivering the instruction, the other group members will provide feedback on how well the teacher instruction aligns to the success criteria for explicit and systematic instruction. At the end of each turn, group members will have 2 minutes to share feedback.

Here are the sections you can choose to role-play:

Introduce the Sound /aw/
Introduce the Spelling /aw/ > ‘aw’
Feedback – Introduce the Sound /aw/

Feedback - Introduce the Spelling /aw/ > ‘aw’



| Clear, direct teaching |  | Logically sequenced |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frequent checks for understanding |  | Builds on prior knowledge |  |
| Active participation |  | Proceeds in manageable steps |  |


| Criteria | Evidence in Instruction | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clear, direct teaching | Met Not Met | The teacher models how to pronounce the long /i/ sound in different words. Models what the mouth should look like when making the long /i/ sound. |
| Frequent checks for understanding | Met Not Met | The teacher asks students to repeat words and give a thumbs up if they hear the long /i/ sound. |
| Active participation | Met Not Met | Students have multiple opportunities to actively participate and practice the skill. |
| Logically sequenced | Met Not Met | Students previously learned different long vowel sounds. The lesson progresses from the teacher saying the individual sound to listening and repeating words with the long /i/ sound in the beginning, then middle, then end. The teacher then shows how to write the long /i/ sound. |
| Builds on prior knowledge | Met Not Met | The teacher builds on students’ prior knowledge of the magic e. |
| Proceeds in manageable steps | Met Not Met | The lesson progresses from the teacher saying the individual sound to listening and repeating words with the long /i/ sound in the beginning, then middle, then end. Students then must listen for the sound in words. |


| Criteria | Evidence in Instruction | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clear, direct teaching | Met Not Met | Teacher models how to pronounce the /aw/ sound in different words. Models the different between /aw/ and /o/. |
| Frequent checks for understanding | Met Not Met | As students repeat/say words, the teacher can check for correct pronunciation of sounds. |
| Active participation | Met Not Met | Students have multiple opportunities to actively participate and practice the skill. |
| Logically sequenced | Met Not Met | The lesson progresses from the teacher saying the individual sound to listening and repeating words with first the /aw/ sound in the beginning, then middle, then end. Students then must listen for the difference between /aw/ and /o/ in words. |
| Builds on prior knowledge | Met Not Met | No evidence in lesson plan; look for ways the teacher helped build on students’ prior knowledge. |
| Proceeds in manageable steps | Met Not Met | The lesson progresses from the teacher saying the individual sound to listening and repeating words with first the /aw/ sound in the beginning, then middle, then end. Students then must listen for the difference between /aw/ and /o/ in words. |


| Criteria | Evidence in Instruction | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clear, direct teaching | Met Not Met | Teacher models how to write ‘aw.’ |
| Frequent checks for understanding | Met Not Met | Check for understanding as students trace ‘aw’ on their desks and make the sound for ‘aw.’ |
| Active participation | Met Not Met | Students traced the spelling ‘aw’ on their desks. |
| Logically sequenced | Met Not Met | The students were first introduced to the sound /aw/ then taught how to write ‘aw.’ The teacher modeled first then students practiced. |
| Builds on prior knowledge | Met Not Met | Writing ‘aw’ builds on what students did in the previous section where they repeated and listened for the /aw/ sound. |
| Proceeds in manageable steps | Met Not Met | The students were first introduced to the sound /aw/ then taught how to write ‘aw.’ The teacher modeled first then students practiced. |
