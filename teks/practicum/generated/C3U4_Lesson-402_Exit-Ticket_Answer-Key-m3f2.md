### Lesson 4.02: Conceptual Understanding-Math Tricks and Misconceptions

Name:
Date:
Answer the following questions:
Describe the pitfalls of teaching math tricks and shortcuts.
Teaching students “tricks” does not help them to understand why the math works or even practice procedural fluency. This means students could miss on conceptual understanding required for future learning. Tricks also are limited in their application and do not always work in every situation.
Read the scenario below and determine if the teacher is using a trick or teaching conceptual understanding. Explain your reasoning.
Scenario: A math teacher is teaching students strategies for solving word problems. She teaches students to look for keywords in the word problem to identify the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) that is needed to solve the problem. She tells her students that when they see the words “more than” it always means that they should be adding.
This is a trick. While looking at key words may be strategy, the students cannot look for specific words to always indicate an operation. They need to read an analyze the whole problem to determine how to solve.
