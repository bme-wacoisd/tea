| Rationale/ Summary | Learning is a life-long endeavor and teaching and training occurs in a number of non-traditional settings, including corporations, community outreach, nonprofits, and government entities. In these situations, an educator must be present that is prepared to meet the needs of its learners, which can differ greatly from K-12 learners. In this lesson, students will examine the compare the roles, responsibilities, and preparation of non-traditional educators with traditional K-12 educators. | Learning is a life-long endeavor and teaching and training occurs in a number of non-traditional settings, including corporations, community outreach, nonprofits, and government entities.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | What are non-traditional educators? Darryl recently graduated from college with a double major in education and business. He is looking for a job teaching adults for an organization in the business field. What job titles should he be looking for in his search?  Identify three similarities between traditional K-12 educators and non-traditional educators. (Consider their preparation, daily responsibilities, etc.) Explain how the responsibilities of non-traditional educators differ from that of K-12 educators.  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | What are non-traditional educators? Darryl recently graduated from college with a double major in education and business.

|  | As an alternative to the Venn Diagram portion of this lesson or an extension, consider having students: interview someone within your network who serves as a non-traditional educator in the corporate, government, or non-profit space. For example, restaurants, salons, libraries, community outreach programs, etc. often have professional development led by an internal or external trainer. research non-traditional educator positions in industries they find interesting to discover their job titles, the required experience/training/schooling, salary (where possible), travel required, the type of training they provide, etc. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: How do adults learn new information and skills once they finish school?  What skills that K-12 teachers hold would be beneficial for someone hoping to teach adults? What additional skills might they need? | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Bellringer Review T: Who can volunteer to share their response for the first question of our bellringer? S: (Provides response) T: What about the second question?  S: (Provides response) |  |
| 12 mins | Notes: Introduction to Non-traditional educators T: No matter what career path you choose, you will need to learn new things for your job. Educators who work outside of schools also facilitate a variety of learning experiences. Today we are going to be learning more about these non-traditional educators.  T: Please find the non-traditional educators notes section on your student guide. S: (Locate the section on student guide.) T: We are going to begin with a definition of a non-traditional educator. professionals who develop and implement programs intended to improve employees’ skills and knowledge in an industry outside of K-12 schools. S: (Write definition in student guide.) T: Non-traditional educators may work in corporations, community outreach, nonprofits, and government entities.  T: What sorts of new information or skills might an adult need to learn in any of these industries? S: Maybe they have a new software to use at work, new equipment, new policies, etc. T: Much of your time in your education and training course have been focused on pedagogy, which is the practice of educating students. These non-traditional educators often practice andragogy. If pedagogy is educating students, what do you think andragogy means? S: andragogy means teaching adults. T: Here is a formal definition: the method and practice of teaching adult learners T: Please locate the Non-traditional Educators graphic organizer. S: (Locate organizer) T: (guide students to complete the graphic organizer using PowerPoint) S: (Complete graphic organizer) T: Take the next two minutes to turn and talk with your neighbor to discuss how the responsibilities of non-traditional educators are similar and different to that of K-12 teachers (Set timer for 2 minutes). S: (Turn and talk) T: How do are the responsibilities of non-traditional educators like those of traditional K-12 teachers? S: (Answers will vary but may include planning, delivery, knowledge of content, knowledge of students, knowledge of instructional delivery. T: How are they different?  S: (Answers will vary but may include differences in age, content, grading, location, type of instructional delivery, purpose for learning.) | Student Guide, PPT |
| 5 mins | Notes: Non-traditional Educator Pathways T: How does a person become a nontraditional educator? What do you think is required? S: (Answers will vary)  T: Please locate the Teacher Pathway Scenarios on your student guide. S: (Locates scenarios) T: There are many different routes that could lead to a nontraditional educator role. Much of it depends on the organization you hope to work with. Please fill in the blanks as we review these two possible scenarios.  T: You will likely need a college degree. A degree in Education or Human Resources Training and Development will provide you with the andragogy skills needed to teach adults in the workplace.  T: A degree in another field will provide you with content knowledge you could later apply to teaching adults in the workplace. For example, a degree in computer science could help you train adults to write computer code. Which path seems most effective? S: (Answers will vary) T: Let us compare the requirements to becoming non-traditional educators—how are they similar or different to that of traditional K-12 Teachers? S: They are similar because both require a bachelor’s degree, but the non-traditional educator do not typically need certification. |  |
| 10 mins | Practice: K-12/Non-traditional educators Venn Diagram   T: Now that you have a feel for the roles and responsibilities of non-traditional educators, we are going to compare this group with traditional K-12 educators. Please locate the Venn diagram in your student guide.  S: (Locates Venn diagram)   T: Please take the next seven minutes completing your Venn diagram. Consider preparation, daily responsibilities, and any other elements we discussed in your responses. Also, please be sure to include at least three elements in each section of the diagram. (Set timer for 7 minutes. Circulate to monitor and answer student questions.)  S: (Complete Venn Diagram)  T: Let us review what you have put together. As your peers’ share, please add additional items they shared that you do not have. We will start with what these two groups have in common. Who can volunteer to share what they have?   S: (Responses can include: Develop and teach content to students. Use Data to inform their instruction. Execute lesson plans. Communicate Progress with students. Require a bachelor’s degree to do the job. Work to cater learning to learner’s needs. T: What characteristics are unique to non-traditional educators?  S: Responses can include: Teach adults (practice andragogy) Focus on what different companies/industries need. Do not require certifications. Higher median salary Work for companies/organizations  T: Finally, what things are unique to K-12 teachers?  S: Responses can include: Teach students (practice pedagogy) Teach based on state standards (TEKS) Require teacher certification to become a teacher. Work for a school district Must manage student behavior | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Debrief T: Today we talked about non-traditional educators and how they are similar and different from traditional K-12 educators. What is the definition of non-traditional educators?   S: Professionals who develop and implement programs intended to improve employees’ skills and knowledge in an industry outside of K-12 schools.  T: Between traditional K-12 educators and non-traditional educators, which preparation system is more rigorous? Why?  S: Traditional K-12, because it requires you to become certified with the state, you must have courses in education and pass the teacher certification exam. Non-traditional educators generally do not have to go through a certification process to enter the field. |  |
