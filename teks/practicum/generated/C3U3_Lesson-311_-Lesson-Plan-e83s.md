|  | Prior to the lesson, the teacher will need to print and label the different assessments for the card sort. | Card Sort Materials |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Match the type of assessment with its correct definition and when it is used. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Assessment Data T: What is the purpose of assessment?  S: to assess student progress and inform instruction  T: Why is it important to frequently monitor foundational skill development?  S: So, you can determine what students know and do not know right away.  T: Right – if a teacher does not frequently monitor students’ development of key foundational skills, they may miss gaps that will compound and widen over time.   T: In our previous lesson, we looked at different types of assessments. What are the different types of assessments we discussed? S: formative, summative, interim, and diagnostic. T: Today, we are going to go deeper into those types of assessments in the context of reading instruction. T: The assessment types we discussed yesterday can be further broken down into cold, warm, and hot assessments. Let us look at each of those. T: (share via PPT as students record notes in Student Guide.) Cold assessments include texts and topics that students have not read before or topics with which they are unfamiliar. These types of assessments are usually multiple choice, such as the STAAR passages.  T: Warm assessments include texts that students have not read, but on topics with which they are moderately familiar. These types of assessments can be multiple choice or open-ended and are usually embedded in the curriculum. T: Hot assessments involve familiar texts that students have read and studied and are usually open-ended questions. These assessments are also embedded in the curriculum. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Practice: Card Sort T: Now, you are going to work in small groups to examine different assessments and sort them into the three categories we just discussed. Let us look at an example together. T: (Model with Card 1). T: Find the assessment that says, “Card 1” and examine the assessment.  S: (Examine card 1). T: I can see that this assessment is a phonological awareness screening test that is given individually to students to determine their level of phonological skills. Although students would be familiar with the skills, they would not have seen the words or texts before; therefore, this assessment would likely be considered a warm assessment. It would be used to help inform the teacher’s point of instruction for each student.  T: Now, you are going to analyze the remaining cards to determine if each assessment is cold, warm, or hot. You will record your answers in your Student Guide. T: Are there any questions? T: You will have 8 minutes. You may begin. T: (After 8 minutes, begin class discussion.) T: Were there any cards that you struggled to identify or had a great discussion around? S: Students share questions or key highlights from discussions. | Card Sort Materials |
| 5 mins | Notes: Assessments Data, Part 2  T: Let us look deeper into how teachers use the assessment data to support students and common pitfalls associated with each type of assessment.  T: (Share via PPT as students record notes in Student Guide).  T: Cold assessments are used to support students because they  Track longer term student growth, valuate program effectiveness. Evaluate school-wide and classroom effectiveness. Support planning school-wide interventions T: Some pitfalls to cold assessments are that teachers Attempt to improve cold read performance with colder read practice. Assess too frequently. Align instruction and reteach to discrete, skills- based lessons.  T: Warm and hot assessments are used to support students because they  Identify root causes of learning gaps to provide students targeted support. Look ahead to emphasize curriculum-embedded scaffolds. Support teachers in planning Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports for students in upcoming units.  T: Some pitfalls to warm/hot assessments are that teacher often Disaggregate data based on discrete comprehension standards. Insert skills-based mini lessons |  |
| 15 mins | Practice: Lesson Analysis  T: Now, we are going to read an excerpt from a Grade 5 Unit 2 text called An Amazing Apprentice. Then you are going to work with a partner to look at a student work sample to determine what we can learn from the student’s response to the text.   T: In your Student Guide, find the section titled “Practice: Lesson Analysis” and read the excerpt silently.  S: (read text in Student Guide.)  T: Now, we are going to review an excerpt of a student work sample to determine what can we learn from student responses to text. As we review the work sample, we want to consider the following questions:  What does the student’s work demonstrate about his/her understanding of the task? What does the student’s work demonstrate about the depth of his/her understanding of the text and topic?  T: (Display student work sample via PPT as students follow along in Student Guide.)  T: Find the student work sample in your Student Guide.  S: (locate student work sample.)  T: The student work sample asks the student to:  Respond to the following prompt in 5-7 sentences. Include two or more pieces of evidence in your response: How is the spirit of the Renaissance represented in Leonardo Da Vinci’s ideas and accomplishments?  The spirit of the Renaissance is represented in Leonardo da Vinci’s ideas because he believes that if there is something in your head you can do it.   Leonardo establishes his own workshop in Florence. Leonardo da Vinci, he lived in a Rocky hill 60 miles outside of Florence. He makes a lot of paintings and new machines. One of the machines was to help humans fly. But it did not work so he broke a leg.   Leonardo Da Vinci showed the spirit of the Renaissance because he always tried to make and invent and paint new things.  T: Let us do the first question together - What does the student’s work demonstrate about his/her understanding of the task?  S: The student did not include two or more pieces of evidence to support their response to the question. The student started listing off facts about Leonardo Da Vinci.  T: What implications does this have for the teacher?  S: This lets the teacher know they need to work with this student on how to support their responses with evidence.  T: Now, I want you to work with a partner to respond to the second question - What does the student’s work demonstrate about the depth of his/her understanding of the text and topic? You will record your responses in your Student Guide.   T: Are there any questions?  S: (ask questions as needed)  T: You will have about 8 minutes. You may begin.  S: (complete activity.) | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief  T: What can the teacher learn about the students understanding of both the task and the text by analyzing their response? S: The teacher can learn that the student had difficulty using evidence from the text to support their answers and had difficulty providing detailed evidence.  T: Why are curriculum embedded assessments important? S: They help drive instructional decisions. T: Why is it important to use a variety of assessment types? S: Different assessments provide insight into different things. Some are used to track growth and understanding while others are used to provide details into specific skills and concepts students need support with. |  |
