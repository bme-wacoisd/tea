| 15 mins | Notes: Educator Code of Ethics T: Ethical conduct and behavior are a key component of educator professionalism. Today we are going to explore how ethical behavior is defined for educators and what it looks like act in an ethical manner toward students and colleagues. As we are introduced to this information you can take notes on your Student Guide in the section titled “Notes: Educator Code of Ethics.”  Please locate that section now.  S: (Locate section in Student Guide.)  T: In the bellringer, I asked you to consider what it meant to be ethical. Ethics are defined as a set of moral principles that govern a person’s behaviors and actions. As you talked with a partner and heard from the class, did you find that everyone defined ethical behavior the same?  S: For the most part yes, but there were some differences.  T: Educators are provided a high level of public trust in working with students. As such it is important that teachers are held to a high standard of ethics and conduct. How might the State of Texas communicate and ensure that all teachers have a clear understanding of ethical behavior?  S: Create a law or policy outlining what is ethical behavior.  T: The State of Texas outlines ethical behavior of educators in their Code of Ethics for Educators. The Code of Ethics for Educators is a legal document that outlines a teacher’s responsibilities to their students and provides standards by which to judge ethical and professional conduct. It also protects the rights of all students by clarifying these responsibilities and expectations for behavior. Let’s look at an excerpt from the Code of Ethics now and see if we can determine what it looks like to act ethically as an educator. Please find the excerpt located in your Student Guide now.   S: (Locate excerpt from Code of Ethics.)  T: As our classmates read the passages, I want you to think about if that sentence tells us about a responsibility of a teacher or if it helps to define ethical behavior. We will record our thoughts on the table in the Student Guide below the passage. Can I have someone read aloud the first sentence only?  Please follow along as the sentence is read.  S: (Volunteers and reads first sentence of passage “The Texas Educator shall comply with standard practices and ethical conduct toward students, professional colleagues, school officials, parents, members of the community and shall safeguard academic freedom.”)  T: Does that sentence discuss a responsibility or tell us about how to act ethically?  S: Responsibility.  T: What is the responsibility it outlines?  S: To act ethically toward students, professional colleagues, school officials, parents, members of the community and safeguard academic freedom.  T: Please make sure that you write that down under the responsibility category. Can I have someone else read the second sentence?  S: (Volunteers and reads “The Texas educator, in maintaining the dignity of the profession, shall respect and obey the law, demonstrate personal integrity, and exemplify honesty and good moral character.”)  T: Does that sentence describe a responsibility or tell us about how to act ethically?  S: How to act ethically  T: What does it say educators should do to act ethically?  S: Respect and obey the law, demonstrate personal integrity, exemplify honesty and good moral character.  T: Can someone read the next sentence?
