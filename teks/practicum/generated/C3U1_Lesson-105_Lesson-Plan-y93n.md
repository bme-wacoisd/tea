| Est Time | Instructional Activities (including formative assessments) | Materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 mins | Bellringer Think about either your most influential or motivating teacher. Write down 3-5 words that you would use to describe him or her. | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share your response and why you chose the teacher you chose. If you are in an even row, your partner is the person in front of you.   S: (Turn and talk.)  T: Any groups with similar reasons for why they chose their teacher?   S: Answers will vary but may include: Yes, he made learning fun and he listened to us. Yes, she held high expectations and, even though she was tough, she was fair. Yes, he was always willing to help me when I needed extra help and encouraged me to do my best work. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Discussion and Notes: Role of the Teacher T: Is it the role of the teacher to inspire and motivate?   S: it is to a degree, but students need to come wanting to learn.   T: What other roles do you believe teachers should have besides writing lesson plans and delivering instruction?  S: Teachers should care about and listen to their students and make sure all students are learning.   T: Teachers are role models to students and demonstrate to students what it means to be kind, caring, and engaged members of the community. Students look up to teachers, and teachers are constant models for students.   T: Though teachers hold many roles, today, you are being introduced to three.  The teacher, as an academic leader, sets high expectations, demonstrates curiosity and enthusiasm for learning, has a deep content knowledge, and prioritize student learning.  The teacher, as a behavior leader, demonstrates ethical and professional behavior, models kindness and fairness toward all students, and strives to develop positive relationships with all students. The teacher as a reflective leader, demonstrates ethical and professional behavior, models kindness and fairness toward all students, and strives to develop positive relationships with all students.  S: (Record definitions in Student Guide.)  T: For the bellringer, you were asked think of your most influential or motivating teacher and to list 3-5 words that would describe him or her. Would any of the words you wrote to describe these influential and motivating teachers align with the definitions of academic leader, behavior leader and reflective leader, and if so, how?   S: Answers will vary but may include: The teacher I selected always had high expectations for everyone but was fair. He would allow for retakes on quizzes and was more focused on making sure that we learned the material rather than just earning the grade.  The teacher I selected was always fair and would always listen to both sides and would support you inside and outside of school. I remember them attending my games. | PPT  Student Guide |
| 20 mins | Practice: Examining Teacher Practice  T: To help us better understand how being an academic, behavior leader and reflective leader shows up in the classroom, we will divide into small groups. We will then read 3 scenarios, and each group will identify each as an example or non-example of the three roles teachers hold, as well as explain why.  T: (Divide students into three groups.)  T: Please select a group facilitator, timekeeper, and spokesperson for each group.  The facilitator will be responsible for ensuring that every group member is on task and clear of the expectation.  The timekeeper will ensure that all members of the group are mindful of the time allotted to keep the assignment. The spokesperson will share the responses from the group.   T: Please take one minute to determine roles. Once, you have identified a facilitator, that person should raise their hand.  S: (Facilitators from all three groups raise their hands.)  T: (Display scenarios 1-3.)  T: Scenario 1 Mr. Thomas is a third-year teacher, and this is his first-year teaching second grade. He often struggles with classroom management. Even though he cares a great deal about his students, he often finds himself using punitive measures to manage his classroom. His principal has assigned him a mentor, but he often does not show up for the meetings with his mentor or is late and unprepared.   T: Please discuss in your groups. Remember you are responding whether Mr. Thomas is an academic, behavioral, or reflective leader and why or why not. Please fill in your graphic organizer as you discuss. You have 4 minutes.    T: Group ,1 what was your discussion, and what did you determine?  S (Spokesperson for group 1): Mr. Thomas is not an academic or behavioral leader. He did not act as a professional because when he needed help, and it was offered, he was not willing to accept that feedback.   T: Group 2, anything that you would like to add or question?  S (Spokesperson for group 2): He is not very kind if he is punishing students because of his poor classroom management.   T: Group 3, how would you change Mr. Thomas’ behavior so that he can be a role model for his students?  S (Spokesperson for group 3): He needs to accept the help that he is being given and treat his students fairly. He should develop a classroom management plan with his students based on rewards.   T: In scenario 2, Mrs. Ekbald is a teacher who is new to the school. She is teaching third grade for the first time. She has a student who has poor attendance. She has reached out to parents, and the parents have promised to get them to school more regularly. When the student is in school, Mrs. Ekbald finds time during the day to give her extra assistance on what she has missed. She also has the classroom volunteer spend extra time with her as well. She does not take her recess period away to do work and makes sure she has all her missing assignments to take home when she is absent. She has met with the counselor about her concern with the student.   T: Please discuss in your groups. You have 4 minutes.   T: Group 2 what was your discussion, and what did you determine?  S (Spokesperson for group 2): We decided that Mrs. Ekbald had high expectations for the student because she made sure the student was learning and able to catch up on assignments. We also though that she was willing to collaborate with the counselor to help the student.   T: Group 3, is there anything that you would like to add or question?   S (Spokesperson for group 3): The teacher prioritized student learning by being available for the student to learn the material when she came to school after having been absent.   T: Group 1 are there any changes that you would make to Mr. Ekbald’s behavior?   S (Spokesperson for group 1): No, Ms. Ekbald seems to be a kind and caring teacher who has put the needs of her student first.   T: In scenario 3, Mr. Stevens is a veteran teacher. He has taught several different grade levels and often serves as a mentor teacher. He remembers his students’ birthdays and communicates with parents regularly about what is happening in his classroom. He has been asked to lead the school’s curriculum committee and just signed up for the district’s reading professional development series.   T: Please discuss in your groups. You have 4 minutes.   T: Group 3, what was your discussion, and what did you determine?  S (Spokesperson for group 3): Mr. Stevens seems like a teacher that not only cares about his students, but also his profession. He wants to be a better teacher.   T: Group 1, is there anything that you would like to add or question?   S (Spokesperson for group 1): The teacher signed up for a reading training when it was not required, which means he wants to be a better teacher.   T: Group 2, are there any changes that you would make to Mr. Steven’s behavior?   S (Spokesperson for group 2): No. Mr. Stevens seems to be a good role model for both students and other teachers. | PPT  Student Guide |
| 3 min | Debrief   T: What did we learn about teacher roles?  S: Teachers can have several different roles, and these roles are demonstrated through their behavior and interactions with students, their families, and other teachers.   T: How did the teachers in the scenario show enthusiasm for learning, setting high expectations and prioritizing student learning?  S:  Teacher in scenario 2 made sure that the student who was missing school got the help he needed and did not miss any assignments.   T How did the teachers collaborate with others to become better teachers?   S: Teacher in scenario 3 signed up for the curriculum committee. Teacher in scenario 2 used a volunteer to help the student who missed a lot of school so that the student was not behind on assignments. |  |
