Delivery Dilemma

Dos and Don’ts of Productive Struggle

Example of Productive Struggle: A 6th grade teacher gives a challenging word problem to expand on her students’ understanding of surface area. The students work together in groups to solve the problem and display their answers on the white board to review their solutions.
Non-Example of Productive Struggle: A 3rd grade teacher uses a 5th grade math resource to challenge her students when discussing fractions. The students work independently to solve the problem and the teacher takes up their work to review who understood the concept.
