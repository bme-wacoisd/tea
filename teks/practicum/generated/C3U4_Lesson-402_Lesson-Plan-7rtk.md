| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Answer the following questions: Describe the pitfalls of teaching math tricks and shortcuts. Read the scenario below and determine if the teacher is using a trick or teaching conceptual understanding. Explain your reasoning. Scenario: A math teacher is teaching students strategies for solving word problems. She teaches students to look for keywords in the word problem to identify the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) that is needed to solve the problem. She tells her students that when they see the words “more than” it always means that they should be adding. See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Answer the following questions: Describe the pitfalls of teaching math tricks and shortcuts.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Consider lessons that you observed from your field site work.  Where have you seen examples of students engaging in conceptual understanding and procedural fluency? Why is balancing conceptual understanding with procedural fluency important when teaching math using RBIS? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: Please turn to a partner and share your thoughts on the bellringer.  S: (Share experiences and thoughts with partner.) T: Can someone share what you and your partner discussed around the reason it is important to teach both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency? S: (Answers will vary but should include ideas about how it is important that students can complete calculations quickly and accurately as well as utilize knowledge gained in math flexibly to solve problems.) |  |
| 5 mins | Notes: Conceptual Understanding-The Problem with Math Tricks T: In our prior lesson we discussed RBIS for Math. The first strategy that we discussed was the importance of balancing conceptual understanding with procedural fluency. We examined some examples of teaching conceptual understanding in our prior lesson, however, sometimes math tricks are used to “short cut” the math or to make math easier for students. Unfortunately, using shortcuts or math tricks instead of teaching deep conceptual understanding can leads to misconceptions for students. In today’s lesson we will build a deeper understanding of conceptual understanding and explore why teaching math tricks or shortcuts leads to misconceptions for students. As we go through the information and examples, you can take notes in your student guide in the section titled “Notes: Conceptual Understanding-The Problem with Math Tricks.”  Please locate that now.  S: (Locate student guide.)  T: What is conceptual understanding?  S: It is being able to understand the “why” of the math.   T: When we build conceptual understanding in students, they become confident problem solvers who know why the mathematical procedures work. The rules of math do not change, and conceptual understanding helps students to reason through problems when they become more complex, and the numbers become tricky.  T: Have you ever seen a “trick” in math class that is supposed to “make math easier”? Maybe you have seen this in your field experiences or learned it in past math classes.   S: (Share examples of math tricks they have seen).  T: There is a misconception that using “tricks” is the new way to do math. However, students who rely on tricks are easily confused with new concepts because they do not understand the rules and properties of numbers. Here are some examples of tricks that, without conceptual understanding, will lead to gaps in knowledge for students. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Examples: Math Tricks  T: Sometimes it is tempting as a teacher to use tricks to help students but relying on these tricks leads to bigger problems in the future because students do not understand the why behind the math. Additionally, tricks often only work in specialized situations and tend to fall apart as problems become more complex. Let us look at the first trick. (Display Trick #1 on ppt.) T: Problem number 1 is 15.98 x 100. The concept that is being taught is multiplying by powers of 10. Does anyone know the trick for multiplying by powers of 10? S: Move the decimal to the right. T: The trick that is often taught is that you can simply move the decimal to the right one space for every zero. Has anyone seen or used this trick before? S: (Share thoughts). T: What do you think is the problem with just teaching students to move decimals? S: Students just move decimals around without understanding why. T: The problem with this trick is that students arbitrarily move decimals around because they do not understand multiplication. This leads to problems in the future because the numbers get much larger and complicated and it can be easy to lose track of the decimals in the problem. T: Let us look at another trick that is common. The problem number 2 is seven minus negative ten. The concept being taught is subtracting negatives increases the amount. Does anyone have a trick that they were taught about subtracting negatives?  S: (Share examples). T: The trick that is often taught when subtracting negatives is “Keep, add a line, change the sign.”  This means that the first number stays the same, a line is added to change the negative to a positive, and the sign of the second number is changed. Have you seen or used this trick? What could be the problem with only relying on this trick for subtracting negative numbers? S: (Share answers.) T: The problem with this trick is that it often falls apparent when the problems get more complex. It is easy to lose a negative sign or forget to change something when problems get longer or include more parentheses. Students also will not know whether their answer makes sense or not. Instead of simply teaching students to keep, add a line, and change the sign, how might a teacher build the conceptual knowledge that subtracting a negative number results in an increase in the amount? S: The teacher could demonstrate this concept using a number line. T: Using a number line to show students visually what is happening when you subtract a negative would support students who may have this gap in knowledge due to only learning the trick. |  |
| 15 mins | Practice: Math Tricks & Misconceptions T: For your practice today, you will be working with a group of three to examine examples of math tricks that lead to misconceptions in the lower grades. As a group, discuss why the rule will expire in older grades and devise a way to help students who have a misunderstanding about the concept. The examples can be found in your student guide under “Practice: Math Tricks and Misconceptions.”  S: (Locate examples).  T: (Assign student groups or ask students to find a group of three.)  With your group, look at each example of “rules” that are taught in lower grades. Discuss why the rule will expire in older grades and produce at least one idea of how you could help students who have a misunderstanding about the concept. Are there any questions? S: (Students ask clarifying questions.)  T: You may begin. (Set timer for 15 minutes.)  S: (Complete practice activity.) |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Now I want you to turn to another group and compare your answers from the practice examples.  S: (Compare practice examples.)  T: How did you do? Were you all able to determine why the rule expires in older grades and produce a way to help students with misconceptions?  S: (Responses will vary.)  T: What are some of the pitfalls of using math tricks instead of teaching conceptual understanding?  S: The trick did not help the student to better understand the why of the math and it had limited application or could be wrong sometimes.  T: Teaching tricks without teaching conceptual understanding can be very harmful because students who rely on tricks often have gaps in knowledge as they get older. As you saw in your practice, many of the tricks also expire as you move into higher levels and more complicated examples. | Student Guide |
