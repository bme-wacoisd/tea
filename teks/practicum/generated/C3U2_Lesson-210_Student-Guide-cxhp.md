Guided Practice: Scenarios on Ethics
Mr. Jones is walking by another classroom when he hears a teacher getting sick. He sticks his head into the classroom and asks if she needs any help. The teacher apologizes and says that she is taking medication for a serious medical condition and that it makes her nauseous. Mr. Jones wants to make sure that this teacher gets the help she needs, so he tells the principal and the other teachers who have classrooms in that hallway.
Is Mr. Jones acting in an ethical manner based on the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators?



What are some of the potential negative consequences for the teachers?



How could Mr. Jones have acted more ethically?

| Ms. Truman teaches 12th grade English. Several of her students are interested in attending the college that she graduated from, which is located about an hour away from the school. She offers to take a few students there to see a football game if they meet her at the school at 10:00 am on a Saturday morning. |  |  |  |
| Mr. Madison is filling out a form to be reimbursed for some school supplies that he bought for his classroom. He’s been working at night and on the weekends to provide high-quality instruction for his students, and he’s disappointed that he doesn’t get extra pay for this work. While he only spent $75 on supplies, he submits a reimbursement form for $125. |  |  |  |
