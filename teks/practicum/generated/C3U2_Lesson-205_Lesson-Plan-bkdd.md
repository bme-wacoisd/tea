| 2 mins | Bellringer:  Think of a time where you have had conflict with another person.  How did communication impact the initial conflict?  How did communication play a role in resolving the conflict? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | T: Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share your responses and reasonings with a partner. If you are in an even row, your partner is the person in front of you.  As you talk, think about how communication played a part in the conflict and impacted your ability to resolve the conflict.  S: (Turn and talk.)  T:  Can someone share what you discussed about the role of communication in creating and/or resolving the conflict you experienced?   T: (Call on a few students to share their thoughts.)  S: Student responses will vary. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Notes: Introduction to Professional Communication during Conflict T: As an educator, you are expected to be a master communicator. The way you interact with others, whether it be students, parents, other colleagues, or the community is a key indicator of professionalism as an educator.  One of the most common, but difficult, situations you will encounter as an educator is conflict.  As you saw in the bellringer and discussion, conflict is heavily influenced, good or bad, by ways individuals communicate.  Today we will discuss characteristics of effective communication during conflict.  Please locate the Introduction to Characteristics of Effective Communication section on your Student Guide.  You can record some key ideas that we discuss there.  S: (Locate the introduction section on their Student Guide.)  T: First, let’s talk about what we mean by conflict.  How would you define conflict?  S: A disagreement or argument.  T: Conflict is when you have two or more individuals who are interacting with one another and disagree or argue.  Can you think of some examples of where conflict might show up for an educator?  S: (Answers will vary but might include conflict with colleagues and disagreements with parents or students.)  T: When conflict arises, it is important for educators to remain professional.  Professional communication is the key to de-escalating the conflict.  What do I mean by de-escalating the conflict?  S: Not making it worse but working to make it better.  T: We want to communicate in a way that helps resolve the conflict rather than making it worse. There are techniques that guide effective communication during conflict.  T: The first key to effective communication during conflict is active listening.  Has anyone heard of active listening before?   S: (Raise hands as familiar.)  T: What do you think active listening is?  S: When you are really trying to listen and understand what the other person is saying.  T: Active listening is different from just listening.  Active listening is a way of listening and responding to another person that improves mutual understanding. When you are engaging in active listening you are: Making eye contact Facing the other person Refrain from interrupting  Acknowledging the other person (nods, etc.) Repeat or restate what speaker says  T: Let’s look at an example of active listening.  Can I get someone to read the example of active listening from your student guide? (Choose student to read the example.)  How does this reflect the active listening strategies?  S: The teacher stopped what they were doing to hear the student.  They made eye contact and clarified the reason the student was upset.    T: Yes, all those actions make the student feel seen and heard, which is the first step to resolution.  What might that same example look like if the teacher didn’t utilize active listening?  S: The teacher would have continued what they were doing and maybe even told the student to go figure it out themselves.  T: In that example the teacher didn’t show that they were listening to the student to hear and support that student.  Another characteristic of effective communication during conflict is managing nonverbal communication.  What do we mean by nonverbal communication?  S: What your body language says during the interaction.  T: We communicate a lot through our body language alone.   Up to 93% of all communication can be nonverbal.  As humans, we pay close attention to expressions, body language, and tones and sounds.  Managing nonverbal communication means that we are aware and intentional about all these things.  In conflict you should: Relax your stance  Show interest or care/concern through facial expressions  Use a calm tone of voice can help de-escalate conflict  T: For example, if a parent confronts you about a situation that happened in class by yelling, managing nonverbal communication means that you turn to face the parent, relax your body, adjust your facial expressions to show that you are listening and are concerned.  Once the parent stops speaking, you respond in a calm, measured voice.  How might a non-example of managing nonverbal communication look in this same situation?  S: Yelling back at the parent or having an angry expression or aggressive stance.  T: The key to managing nonverbal communication to respond with calmness that lowers the overall energy level, thus de-escalating the situation.  The third characteristic is confronting the situation, not the person.  This means: don’t make conflict personal.   address what is wrong in the situation or the specific disagreement  T: Can someone read the example from the table for confronting the situation, not the person? (Choose student to read the example).  S: (Reads example.)  T: How is this an example of confronting the situation, not the person?  S: The situation was that the work looked the same.  Rather than assuming it was copied, the teacher spoke to the student privately to discuss why it was similar.  T: Yes.  Can someone read the non-example for this situation? (Choose a student to read the non-example).  S: (Read non-example from table).  T: How is this a non-example?  S: The teacher accused the student of cheating in class and told them they got a zero for being a cheater. That made it feel more personal and didn’t address the problem of the work looking the same.  T: Our last characteristic is using “I” statements to communicate ideas and needs.  “I” statements is a style of communication that focuses on the feelings or beliefs of the speaker.  When someone utilizes the word “you” during conflict, it can immediately make someone feel attacked, like when the teacher in the last example called the student a cheater.  Using “I” statements helps to communicate your perspective without attacking or accusing the other person.  For example, if a teacher is working with a colleague to plan for an upcoming lesson but the colleague shows up late or continues to cancel their meetings, this could cause conflict.  The teacher could approach the situation by expressing concern about the missed meetings and saying, “When our meetings are canceled or running late, I feel disrespected and that my not time is not being honored. I am concerned we aren't dedicating enough time to planning this lesson well." Where do you see “I statements” used in this example?  S: The teacher used the phrase “I feel disrespected…” and “I am concerned”  T: Great.  Can someone read the non-example from the table showing how this might look without the use of “I” statements? (Choose a student to read non-example.) S: (Reads non-example from table.) T:  You might see how using “you” in this situation could make the colleague feel attacked, which could easily escalate the conflict rather than working to resolve it.  Now let’s put all these pieces together and practice these characteristics in a role-play scenario. | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | Modeling: Characteristics of Effective Communication Role Play T: In a few minutes, you are going to practice effective characteristics of communication during conflict in a role play scenario.  Let me show you what this will look like.  Can I have a volunteer to play the student in this role play scenario with me?  S: (Raise hands to volunteer.)  T: The scenario is described in your Student Guide under the Modeling: Characteristics of Effective Communication through Conflict section.  Can I get a volunteer to read the scenario aloud as everyone else follows along?   S: (Raise hands to volunteer to read.  Volunteer reads the scenario aloud.)  T: Thank you for reading for us.  In the role play, you (pointing to student volunteer for role play) will play the role of Maria, and I will play the role of Ms. Jessup.   As we role play this scenario, I want everyone else in the class to be on the lookout for the characteristics of effective communication during conflict.  Can someone remind us of what they are?  S: Active listening, managing nonverbal communication, addressing the situation not the person, and using “I” statements.  T: Let’s get started with Maria walking to Ms. Jessep as she sits at her desk.   T: (Sit at desk to pretend to be Ms. Jessep.)  S: (Walk up to desk with test in hand and speak using a loud, frustrated voice.)   S: This test is all wrong!  T: (Look up from desk to make eye contact with Maria.  Speak in a concerned voice with a concerned expression.)   T: Maria, you seem upset.  What has you so upset?  S: This test.  I failed this test, and it is all wrong! I’m going to be grounded if I fail this test.  T: What do you mean the test is wrong.  Can you explain it to me?  S: Some of these questions are marked wrong but I am sure that they are right.  I studied really, really hard!  T: (Reach for the test. Maintain calm voice while making eye contact.)    T: Can you show me the questions that you are referring to?  Let’s get this situation resolved together.  There is always a chance that I made a mistake.  S: (Point to problems in question.)    T: I think this one is correct, and this one too.  It looks like many of the multiple-choice questions are marked wrong.  T: (Look at the questions pointed out by Maria with concerned expression.)   T: There definitely seems to be something wrong here.  I may have made a mistake.  I really appreciate you bringing this to my attention.  I will go back and re-grade this test.    T: (Smile at Maria at the end of role play.)  T: That is the end of the role play.  What did you see in this model that reflected the characteristics of effective communication during conflict?  S: Ms. Jessup made eye contact and actively listened to Maria’s concerns.   T: Those are examples of active listening.  Anything else?  S: Even though Maria was upset, Ms. Jessup used a calm voice.  She also acknowledged the fact that Maria looked upset and told her they would figure it out together.  T: Did you see any examples of confronting the situation, not the person or using “I” statements?  S: Ms. Jessup didn’t get upset with Maria when she raised her voice.  She confronted the situation of the incorrect answers, not Maria’s yelling.  Also, she said “I might have made a mistake”.  T: All of those are great examples of the characteristics.  Now you will get to participate in role playing in small groups. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice: Effective Communication through Conflict Role Play T: To practice these effective communication skills, you will work with a group of three.   T: (Arrange students into groups of three.)   T: Each person in the group will get a chance to participate in the role play, as well as serve as an observer.  There are three scenarios in your Student Guide.  Please locate them in the section titled “Practice.”  S: (Locate practice section.)  T: In a minute, I am going to ask you to get into your group of three.  There will be three rounds of role play, each lasting about 2-3 minutes.  As two members of the group role play the situation, the third will observe and take notes on where they saw examples of the characteristics of effective communication.  There will be about 2 minutes to discuss what was observed at the end of each round.  I will keep time to make sure that we get through all the scenarios.  Please move to your groups now.  S: (Move to assigned groups.)  T: Now that you are in your groups, decide quickly which two members will participate in the role play of scenario 1 and who will observe.  S: (Identify roles for scenario 1.)  T: Please briefly read through the scenario.   T: (Set 1 min timer.)  S: (Read scenario 1.)  T: I will set a timer for 2.5 minutes for you to role play.  What questions do you have for me before we get started?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)  T: You may begin with scenario 1.   T: (Set 2.5 min timer.)  S: (Begin scenario 1 role play in groups.)  T: Time is up for scenario 1 role play.  Now take 1.5 minutes to discuss what characteristics were observed.   T: (Set 1.5 min timer.)  S: (Discuss scenario 1.)  T: Ok.  Now let’s move on to scenario 2.  Please read through the scenario and decide on roles.  Remember, everyone should have the chance to be in a role play and serve as an observer.    S: (Read Scenario 2 and choose roles.)  T: You may begin with scenario 2.   T: (Set 2.5 min timer.)  S: (Begin scenario 2 role play in groups.)  T: Time is up for scenario 2 role play.  Now take 1.5 minutes to discuss what characteristics were observed.   T: (Set 1.5 min timer.)  S: (Discuss scenario 2.)  T: Ok, let’s move on to the last scenario.  Please read through it briefly and decide on roles.   S: (Read scenario 3 and choose roles.)  T: You may begin with scenario 3.   T: (Set 2.5 min timer.)  S: (Begin scenario 3 role play in groups.)  T: Time is up for scenario 3 role play.  Now take 1.5 minutes to discuss what characteristics were observed.   T: (Set 1.5 min timer.)  S: (Discuss scenario 3.) |  |
| 2 mins | Debrief T: Today we discussed how important communication can be in de-escalating and resolving conflict.  We reviewed four different characteristics of effective communication during conflict.  Can someone share what they are?  S: Active listening, managing nonverbal communication, addressing the situation not the person, and using “I” statements.  T: During your role play, which of those was the easiest to incorporate? Why?  S: Answers will vary.  T: Which was the toughest to manage? Why?  S: Answers will vary. |  |
