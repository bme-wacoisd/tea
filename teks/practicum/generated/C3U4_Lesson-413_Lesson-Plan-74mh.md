| Rationale/ Summary | Throughout this unit, students have planned a just-in-time math intervention for use in their internship class. This lesson is a culmination of that work, allowing students the opportunity to discuss and reflect on their project in small groups. In doing so, students will reflect on the value just-in-time interventions can bring to grade-level math instruction. | Throughout this unit, students have planned a just-in-time math intervention for use in their internship class.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Answer the following questions based on your small group discussion.  What is the most challenging part of implementing a just-in-time intervention? What additional supports would be helpful for a teacher in planning a just-in-time intervention? Why is it important for teacher to use just-in-time interventions when providing grade-level content for all students?

|  | This lesson is designed to follow students’ implementation of their planned just-in-time intervention in their internship class. Each should have completed the Project document and ideally had an opportunity to execute their intervention with students.  If students have not been able to do so, additional time can be provided for students to execute their planned intervention in class with small groups of peers prior to this reflection discussion.   This discussion is written to be completed in pairs, but groups can increase in size as needed, adding 10 minutes to the length of the activity for each additional student. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Mr. W is about to begin the second math unit with his 6th grade math. Based on what he has seen from the first unit, he estimates that 6 of his 24 students (25 percent) still struggle with reciting multiplication and division facts from memory. He thinks that continuing to practice these skills is important for all students, so he has been spending the first 20 minutes of his one-hour math block just focusing on practicing multiplication and division with his whole class. Once they are confident in their skills, he feels that he can move on to more grade-level content.  Which pitfalls of math instruction is Mr. W experiencing? How can he avoid this pitfall? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Bellringer Review  T: What pitfalls to of math instruction is Mr. W Experiencing?  S: Mr. W is Prioritizing Fluency over grade level content.   T: How can he avoid this pitfall?  S: He should use fluency practice as part of a just-in-time intervention, but not use it instead of grade-level content | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Instruction: Preview Intervention Discussion  T: Today, you will have the opportunity to discuss your just-in-time intervention with your classmates to share how you planned and implemented your intervention.   T: You should have your completed Portfolio Project Document, which you can use as a starting point for sharing your experience with this intervention.  S: (Retrieve portfolio project document)   T: Today we will use a facilitated discussion protocol that allows pairs of students to share an overview of their intervention before providing space for clarifying questions from a partner. Below your bellringer you will see instructions for this activity and a table with questions to support your discussion.  T: Each partner will first have four minutes to talk about their intervention project. The column of the table titled “Overview Prompts” will give you an idea of the types of information you should share. This is also closely aligned with what you included in your portfolio project document. During this time, only that speaker will be able to talk.  T: Then, the other person will have 6 minutes to ask any questions for the speaker. To help, the table includes “Sample Clarifying Questions” to get you started. You do not have to ask all of these; they are just there in case you need them.  T: What questions do you have about this discussion?   S: (Ask clarifying questions.)   T: (Answer clarifying Questions.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 20 mins | Practice: Just-in-time Intervention Discussion  T: (Group students as appropriate and allow time for them to move to sit close to their partner)   S: (Move to be with partner)  T: Between the two of you, decide who will go first. Then the first person will have four minutes to provide an overview their intervention.  S: (First partner provides an overview)  T: Now ask any clarifying questions. Feel free to use the sample questions in your student guide as a starting point, if needed.  S: (Discussion)  T: Now the person who started as the speaker will switch, and the other will have four minutes to provide their overview.  S: (Switch roles and provide overview)  T: You now have six minutes to ask clarifying questions)  S: (Discussion)  T: Please return to your seats for our debrief.  S: (Return to original seats) |  |
| 8 mins | Debrief   T: Overall, how did your interventions go?  S: (Responses will vary)  T: Who has a shout out for their partner for their work on this intervention?  S: (Responses will vary)  T: What are some challenges you shared or heard with developing a just-in-time intervention?  S: (Responses will vary but may include: finding time to do the intervention, selecting the content to review when there is lots of room for support, finding materials/math problems, etc.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | S: (Complete the Exit Ticket.) | Exit Ticket |
