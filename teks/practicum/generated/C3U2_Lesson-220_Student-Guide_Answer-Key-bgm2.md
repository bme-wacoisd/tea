### Lesson 2.20: Systems for Professional Growth

Name:
Date:
Bellringer
Directions: Referring to your assignment from Lesson 2.18 to interview a teacher about their PD experiences please answer the questions below:
What are some examples of how the teacher you interviewed participated in professional development?
The teacher I interviewed participates in Professional Developments provided by her school and she also went to a technology conference. She would like to apply to Fulbright.
How does professional development support a growth mindset?
Professional development helps teachers grow and learn because they want to improve their skills and take actions to grow their skills.

Notes: School and District-Based Systems for Teacher Growth

Model: Teacher Growth Activities
SAMPLE: Springfield School District of Professional Teacher Growth Opportunities
Springfield School District’s System for Professional Teacher Growth aligns with objectives for student growth. The goal is to improve student outcomes and learning and encourages more teacher collaboration in order to do so. Review some examples of activities and descriptions of those activities.

What do you believe is the purpose of these activities?
The purpose of these activities is to help teachers improve their skills and learn best practices so that they directly impact student outcomes and improve student performance. Even the most successful teachers will have problems or challenges in their classrooms, and activities help teachers address challenges and improve their practice.





Practice: Teacher Growth Activities
Directions: In the activity below, review the different scenarios and suggest the best activity which would help fulfil the areas of growth for the teacher. You are assuming that the school and school district have a system that supports teacher growth through the four following activities: Professional Learning Communities, Peer Observation, Action Research, and Lesson Study.
Define the activity and how it would look, explain your rationale, how it will help teachers, and how it will help students.
Hint: There is a best answer for each example, but the option you choose is correct if your rationale is correct.






| Ways to Grow Professionally as a Teacher | Ways to Grow Professionally as a Teacher | Ways to Grow Professionally as a Teacher |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Continuing Professional Education (CPE) | Long-Term Professional Growth | School and District-Based Systems for Teacher Growth |
| CPE is the Texas equivalent to Continuing Education. It is required for all Texas educators holding a standard teaching certificate. The appropriate number of clock-hours of continuing professional education (CPE) must be completed during each five-year license renewal period.  Classroom teachers must complete 150 CPE hours. | The process by which educators gain new skills, seek opportunities and career experiences to continuously improve their practice and knowledge to benefit both their short and long-term goals. | Schools and districts create different programs and activities to help teachers grow as practitioners, to learn new or refine current skills and knowledge of practice and enable capacity building. It is the commitment to improving. |

| What are school and district-based systems for teacher growth? | Schools and districts create different programs and activities to help teachers grow as practitioners, to learn new or refine current skills and knowledge of practice and enable capacity building. It is the commitment to improving. |
| --- | --- |
| What are examples? | Professional Learning Communities, Peer Observation, Action Research, Lesson Study, Online Courses, Professional Development Sessions |
| Why do school and district-based systems for teacher growth exist? | They help support student success and growth to be ready for post-secondary life. Systems of teacher growth are meant to align to student achievement and benefit the performance of students. They are supportive, job-embedded, focused on instruction, continuous, and collaborative. |


| Activity | Description of Examples | Benefits to Teachers and Students |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Professional Learning Communities | Springfield High School promotes PLCs to help teachers in the same subject areas learn what the others are doing in their classrooms and share best practices. The math teachers meet on the second Tuesday of every month in the afternoons for an hour. Each PLC has a leader who leads it and chooses the theme for the session. | Teachers say the PLCS have helped them improve their classroom skills and improve the delivery of lessons and information to students. |
| Peer Observation | Teachers complete two observations per year—one in which they observe another teacher, and one in which they are observed by a peer. In one observation, teachers identify an area of growth for themselves and are paired with observing a teacher who demonstrates strength in this area.  In another observation, teachers ask for feedback from an observing teacher on a specific area of focus, such as classroom routines. | Teachers learn by observing good practices and receiving nonevaluative feedback from a peer. This system allows teachers to self-identify areas of growth. |
| Action Research | Teachers are encouraged to use action research in their classrooms to implement new strategies or studies. Teachers first read research on an instructional practice. They then design an informal study to monitor the impact the practice has on student learning.  A group of elementary math teachers agree that their students have difficulty with explaining their work on word problems. After reading articles on possible causes and solutions, they engage their students in daily student-led discussions about problem-solving to determine the impact on student math vocabulary and students’ ability to explain how they solved a problem. They give a short assessment each week to identify the effect of the discussions. | Teachers have learned and tested new theories, which helps improve student learning and solve classroom problems.  Action research allows teachers to work on a self-identified area for growth. Teachers may work individually or in groups. |
| Lesson Study | Four Algebra I teachers are teaching polynomials and decide to do a lesson study. They research instructional strategies, plan the lesson together, teach the lesson, observe each other, and then reflect on what students did well and did not do well. | Teachers learn to solve a classroom problem through collaboration and learn how to solve it. Students will work in a way that is most effective and learn in a way that is more effective for them. |


| Teacher Growth Area 1:  A new teacher has started in their first year at a new school, and they struggle with classroom management while giving notes and providing direct instructions – students are constantly talking and not able to pay attention to what the teacher is teaching. Their mentor teacher has suggested they should improve their skills for instructing students on behavior management. |
| --- |
| This would be a good opportunity for a peer observation to see a teacher that has strong behavior management and classroom management systems. The teacher will observe the other teacher during direct instruction and notes. The teacher will take notes and then meet with the teacher afterward to learn more direct skills. This would be the best because it would allow the teacher to see another teacher in action and help that teacher learn skills right away. This helps the teacher become a stronger classroom manager and therefore helps students learn and keep students on task. |


| Teacher Growth Area 2:  A teacher is hoping to encourage students to collaborate more in her classroom but is struggling to get them to do so. She has modeled for them several times different ways to collaborate and has taught lessons that give reasons for students to collaborate, but she finds that the students struggle. She participates in in a PLC monthly at her school but finds that is not helping. She has found a few different methods including changing the seating chart that research supports her need. |
| --- |
| This would be a good opportunity for an action research activity to trial a few different methods she found supported by research. She would do the research activity on her own or do it with a few other teachers. She will change the seating chart in her classroom and observe the differences. She will compare the before and after. This activity is the best because it is a problem-solving method. She will learn new skills and methods that will support student growth and improve student collaboration. |


| Teacher Growth Area 3:  Mr. Scott is teaching Chemistry and has noticed that his classes are not performing as well as they have in the past, and not as well as the other Chemistry teachers at his school. He has tried a few different methods in his classroom to engage students more but doesn’t seem to be getting different results. |
| --- |
| This would be a good opportunity for a Professional Learning Community with other Chemistry teachers at his school. They would all get together once a month and discuss their best practices, and this would be a great opportunity to discuss what is going on his classroom – or what’s not. PLCs are great for collaboration and learning from other teachers, and this would make the most sense before trying other options like activity research. This is best for the teacher to learn different and new best practices, and these best practices that are working in other classrooms might work in his. |


| Teacher Growth Area 4: Mrs. Holding is a new Social Studies teacher who wants to incorporate more literacy strategies into her class. She asked other teachers with whom she works if they have tried these methods or heard of them, and none of them had used them before. She wants to plan a lesson focused on incorporating new literacy studies she has read about, and wants to see if it brings the outcomes she wanted – did students demonstrate the required history content and literacy skill in the exit ticket? |
| --- |
| This would be a good opportunity for a Lesson Study where the teacher tests a new theory and a new strategy. She would create the lesson based on the methods she wants to use and test it in several classes and several lessons. She could also include other teachers. She would then review the results and see if the Exit Tickets and student outcomes meet her expectations. This is best because it is a method of which she is unaware, and a lot of the older teachers have not used them to speak to their success. This will help the teacher test the methods and a learn a new teaching method that would in turn help student develop additional literacy skills. |
