Notes: Professional Learning Organizations and Professional Growth Opportunities
Vocabulary


How do yesterday’s lesson and today’s lesson connect with one another?
It is part of growth mindset - teachers are always improving their skills and their abilities. Yesterday we learned why it is required of them because teachers should not remain the same because students don’t remain the same. But we learned that it also helps keep teachers up to date, it helps teachers improve, it helps teachers help students, etc. Today we are learning about outside opportunities that are available to them.
Model: Researching Professional Learning Organizations and Long-Term Professional Growth Opportunities
Long-term professional opportunities can look very different for different organizations. There are many benefits to participating in long-term professional growth opportunities – but the most important is to find professional growth opportunities that fit the interests and needs of the individual teacher.
