### Lesson 4.10: Remediating, Accelerating, and Just-in-Time Supports

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:
John entered the second grade without having mastered all the first-grade math content standards. His second-grade teacher, noticing this same challenge for many students, spent much of the first few months providing remediation around first grade content before moving onto second grade math concepts. John was able to learn some of these first-grade concepts, but his teacher had to move quickly to address nearly 1.5 years of content in one school year. Unfortunately, he finished second grade with gaps in both first and second grade content.
Now he is entering third grade and his teacher saw similar challenges for many students in a pre-assessment to start the school year. What will happen if his third-grade teacher begins the year the same way his second-grade teacher did? Why?

If his third-grade teacher uses a significant portion of time at the beginning of the year reviewing first- and second-grade content, then they will not have time to teach all the third-grade content too, so John will finish third grade even further behind.

Vocabulary















Contrasting Remediation and Acceleration








Instruction 2: Just-in-time Interventions Notes
Ms. C. is a second-grade teacher using just-in time interventions to help her students catch up on prior skills while still engaging in grade-level content. Examine the table below to determine how she can use acceleration while keeping students on-grade level.

How is Ms. C being strategic with planning her just-in-time interventions?
Ms. C uses a pre-test to know what students need to know and analyzes data to plan her interventions. She also reassesses students to measure how impactful the interventions were.

How is Ms. C being timely with these just-in-time interventions?
Ms. C is beginning her interventions up to two weeks before the next unit, then does them alongside the grade level content by using the 30 minutes prior to the whole group lesson to support students in small groups.

Practice: Identifying Remediation vs Acceleration
Scenario 1: Mr. M and Ms. G both teach 8th grade math. As part of their professional learning community (PLC) they use common assessments to measure their student’s understanding of the 8th grade TEKS. Therefore, they can compare their results to determine what teaching practices are most effective.
Ms. G used her pre-test data to identify the foundational math skills that students have not yet mastered and has designed a four-week “math bootcamp” at the beginning of the school year help students catch up on the concepts they need to succeed in the 8th grade curriculum.
Mr. M used his pre-test data to identify the areas where his students have gaps in foundational content knowledge and has designed small group interventions for select students the week prior to introducing a new concept. He addresses these skills with the students that need it most, making direct connections to the grade level content they will learn the following week.

Which teacher is using acceleration? Which is using remediation?
Mr. M is using Acceleration, while Ms. G is using remediation.

What do you think they will see in their common assessment data (And the 8th grade STAAR test) when they compare their results?
Mr. M will have higher success rates throughout the year, including on the STAAR test because his students will be able to consistently access grade level content, while Ms. G is focusing on below-grade level content early in the year.

Scenario 2: Ms. V and Ms. P both teach 4th grade math. Below are their students’ results on this year’s STAAR test, broken down by Unit.

Which teacher is using acceleration? Which is using remediation? How do you know?
Ms. P is most likely using remediation because her students are scoring lower on the latter units. This means she likely had to rush those last few units due to spending lots of time remediating at the beginning of the year instead of using just-in-time supports. Ms. V most likely used acceleration because her students are consistent in their proficiency rates across units.


| Remediation | Teaching content again to students who did not learn it the first time; filling in gaps |
| --- | --- |
| Acceleration | Ensuring that students are taught grade-level content with supports to address past concepts or skills that students have not mastered. |
| Just-in-Time Supports | Strategic and timely review or reteaching of foundational skills that contribute to success on grade-level content. |

| Is often built on a deficit mindset. Can limit student access to grade-level instruction. Often focuses on drilling students on individual skills that might not be relevant to grade-level content. Based on the assumption that students cannot learn new math skills if they have not mastered every other prior skill. | Sets high expectations by ensuring all students are still engaged with grade-level content. Aligns review of foundational skills with grade-level content. Is provided right when a student will need it (just-in-time.) |
