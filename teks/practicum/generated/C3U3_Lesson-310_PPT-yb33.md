## Slide 10

### Exit Ticket

- Read the following scenario and respond to the questions:
- Mr. J’s class is learning about cause and effect. Prior to starting the unit, he gave his students a pre-assessment to determine what they already knew about cause and effect. Based on the data, he had his students engage in several text-based activities using various sources to identify cause and effect relationships. At the end of the unit, he gives his students an assessment on cause and effect. He thought his students were going to do well, but many didn’t pass the test or show a basic understanding of cause and effect.
- What assessment types did Mr. J implement? Based on what you learned about assessments, what could Mr. J have done differently to ensure his students were learning the content throughout the unit?
