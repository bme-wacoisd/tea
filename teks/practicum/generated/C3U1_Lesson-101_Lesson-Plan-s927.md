|  | Prior to this first class, consider the systems and routines you would like to develop in your classroom. For this lesson, you will need a routine for the following activities:  Student entry into the class Opening of class Transition from independent/group work to next activity Whole class discussion |  |
|  | Plan for how students will obtain their copy of the Student Guide and the supplies needed for the Bellringer. Consider setting them on each desk or directing students to take them from a table as they enter the room. |  |
|  | Begin the first class by modeling a typical routine for beginning class effectively by: standing at the doorway to greet and welcome students upon entry,  directing students to a preferred seating arrangement utilizing a seating chart (seating chart should be projected on a screen for students to see. Alternatively, consider using sticky notes on desks to help student locate their assigned seat),  direct them to complete the bellringer, and completing an attendance record while students complete the bellringer. |  |
|  | Before class begins, prepare to share the story of why you entered teaching and continue to do this work. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: T: (Ask students to complete the interest inventory.)  S: (Complete interest inventory in Student Guide.)  T: (As students complete the bellringer, circulate to each desk to determine each student’s preferred name. Document accordingly in the appropriate classroom records.) | Student Guide |
| 17 mins | Introductions and Bellringer Discussion T: Welcome to the Practicum in Education and Training. We are going to build some of the skills and knowledge you need to be an effective educator, as well as provide you with the opportunity to get some teaching experience. I am excited to be with you on this journey. Shortly, I am going to tell you what brought me into the teaching profession and why I do this work. But first I want us to start to get to know each other by reflecting on the interest inventory questions. Please choose a student sitting near you to be your partner.   S: (Form partner pairs.)  T: Please share your responses to the interest inventory and identify 3 things in the interest inventory that you agreed or strongly agreed with and explain why to your partner. Listening partners should take notes and be prepared to introduce your partner to the class and tell them about those three areas.  S: (Share for 5 minutes capturing partners interests in the Student Guide.)  T: (Bring students back together.)  T: I will now ask each partner pair to take turns introducing each other by sharing their partner’s name, three statements their partner agrees with, and why.  S: (Introduce each other to the class).  T: Thank you all for introducing yourselves. After hearing from your class, why do you think I asked the questions I did in the inventory?  S: Because they are ideas or statements that are important for teaching.  T: Can you provide an example and explain how you think that example from the list relates to teaching?  T: (Calls on 2 or 3 students for examples and explanations.)  S: Answers may vary but may include: I persevere in the face of challenges. Teaching isn’t easy, and you need to be willing to keep working. I like the process of learning new things myself. There will be new and better ways to teach students, and you will need to learn them. I am good at building relationships. Teachers need to get to know their students well.  T: Right. These are all qualities or interests that relate to being a teacher. You certainly don’t need to have all of them to be a teacher, but they are all relevant to what it means to be a teacher day to day.  T: (Share your story of how you entered the profession and why you do the work you do.) | Student Guide |
| 5 min | Course Routines  T: (Share classroom routines through a roll-out speech that highlights why the routines are important and models how to complete them.) T: Now we will move into a quick review of the some of the key topics that we will address in this course. |  |
| 5 min | Practicum Units T: As I mentioned, the name of this course is Practicum in Education and Training. What word do you see within the word practicum?  S: Practice.  T:  A practicum is a learning experience that provides students with the opportunity to apply what they have learned in a real-life situation.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: There will be five units in this course. They will provide you with some of the skills and knowledge needed to be an effective educator. After we complete those five units, you’ll be putting the units into practice by spending some time as a teacher. We will explore that experience in more depth as we get closer to that point in the course.  T: (Display units on the slide deck.)  S: (Capture the key topics in the Student Guide.)  T: Unit 1 is Career Exploration and Awareness. You will not only explore your own approach to teaching, but also learn more about the profession in general, including trends in the teacher workforce and how education in the United States is governed.   T: Unit 2 is Professionalism and Ethics. We’ll explore the Texas Code of Ethics for Educators and consider how educators need to act professionally with their students and colleagues and as role models within their communities.  T: Unit 3 is Research-Based Instructional Strategies in English Language Arts. In this unit, we’ll learn about how teachers of all content areas can support students with building literacy skills.  T: Unit 4 is Research-Based Instructional Strategies in Mathematics.
