| Objectives | Describe school or district-based system activities for teacher professional growth (PLCs, peer observation, action research, Lesson Study). | Describe school or district-based system activities for teacher professional growth (PLCs, peer observation, action research, Lesson Study). | Describe school or district-based system activities for teacher professional growth (PLCs, peer observation, action research, Lesson Study). |
| Rationale/ Summary | There are many ways for teachers to continue their education, develop their skills and grow.  Teacher growth can come through participating in courses, conferences, or professional developments to put toward their CPE hours. It can come from local, state, or national institutions like earning an advanced degree or learning a new area of curriculum from a museum. It can also come from a system established by a school or school district. Schools and districts alike develop systems for teacher growth to support teacher skill development, so they align with the key growth areas for student success. Each school and district will have a different system, and activities that support those systems because student outcome goals are different for each school and district. Today, students will explore common activities that support teacher growth within a school or district, and how those in turn benefit both teachers and students. | There are many ways for teachers to continue their education, develop their skills and grow.

| Lesson Notes | Prepare to discuss what systems or structures of Professional Development are available at your school. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer Referring to your assignment from Lesson 2.18 to interview a teacher about their PD experiences please answer the questions below: What are some examples of how the teacher you interviewed participated in professional development? How does professional development support a growth mindset? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Bellringer Debrief   T: Turn and talk to a partner and share your definition of growth mindset and how a teacher can have a growth mindset for themselves.   S: (Turn and talk to partner.) T:  What are some examples of how the teacher you interviewed participated in professional development? How does professional development support a growth mindset? S: (Answers will vary):  The teacher I interviewed participates in Professional Developments provided by her school and she also went to a technology conference. She would like to apply to Fulbright. Professional development helps teachers grow and learn because they want to improve their skills and take actions to grow their skills. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes:  School and District-Based Systems for Teacher Growth T: There are many opportunities for teachers to continue their education and grow as professionals.  Please refer to the chart in your Student Guide outlining the three different types of teacher growth opportunities we’ve discussed.  S: (Observe chart.)  T: We have learned about Continuing Education and Long-Term Professional Growth. Today, we are going to discuss  systems that support those opportunities.  (Insert your own school’s system for teacher growth and explain.) T: Can anyone think why a school district, or a school would have a system for teacher growth? Think about growth mindset.  S: The purpose of all schools is to help students grow. Schools need systems in place to make sure teachers are also growing and improving as professionals.  T: First, let’s write down some vocabulary for the day.  Professional Learning Communities Peer Observation Action Research Lesson Study T: (Project definitions with PowerPoint.) S: (Write definitions in student guide.) T: (Read definitions aloud after students write.) T: We will now continue with a few questions for your notes. What are school and district-based systems for teacher growth?   T: (Project notes with PowerPoint.) S: (Write response.) Schools and districts create different programs and activities to help teachers grow as practitioners, to learn new or refine current skills and knowledge of practice and enable capacity building. It is the commitment to improving.    T:  What are examples? S: (Write response.) Professional Learning Communities, Peer Observation, Action Research, Lesson Study, Online Courses, Professional Development Sessions T: Why do school and district-based systems for teacher growth exist? S: (Write response.) They help support student success and growth to be ready for post-secondary life. Systems of teacher growth are meant to align to student achievement and benefit the performance of students. They are supportive, job-embedded, focused on instruction, continuous, and collaborative. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 6 mins | Model: Teacher Growth Activities   T: On the next page, you will see a sample of activities that Springfield County Schools has implemented for its teachers for teacher growth. Take a moment to read through the example of each activity and what it means.   S: (Read examples.)  T: What did you observe about the different activities?  S: Each activity helps solve a problem and helps teachers build their capacity and learn new skills.   T: Let’s look at the third column about “Benefits to Teachers and Students.” The first example I have filled out for you. Can someone please read the response out loud?  S: (Read response out loud.)  T: This supports both student and teacher growth – when a teacher grows, so does a student. Take a few minutes to discuss and fill out the third column with a partner. Think about growth mindset when filling this out.   S: (Work with partner to fill out third column.)  T: Can someone share how Peer Observation benefits teachers and students? S: Teachers learn by observing good practices and receiving nonevaluative feedback from a peer. This system allows teachers to self-identify areas of growth. T: Can someone share how Action Research benefits teachers and students?  S:  Teachers have learned and tested new theories, which helps improve student learning and solve classroom problems. Action research allows teachers to work on a self-identified area for growth. Teachers may work individually or in groups. T: Can someone share how Lesson Study benefits teachers and students? S: Teachers learn to solve a classroom problem through collaboration and learn how to solve it. Students will work in a way that is most effective and learn in a way that is more effective for them. T: Take a moment to answer the next question with your partner.  S: (Answer question with partner.) T: Can anyone please share out what they discussed with their partner? S: The purpose of these activities is to help teachers improve their skills and stay up to date with current research so that they directly impact student outcomes and improve student performance. Even the most successful teachers will have problems or challenges in their classrooms, and activities help teachers address challenges and improve their practice. | Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Practice: Teacher Growth Activities T: In the practice section of your student guide, you will find four different narratives about teacher growth. Review the different scenarios and suggest the best activity which would help fulfil the areas of growth for the teacher. You are assuming that the school and school district have a system that supports teacher growth through the four following activities: Professional Learning Communities, Peer Observation, Action Research, and Lesson Study. T: Define the activity and how it would look, explain your rationale, how it will help teachers, and how it will help students.  Hint: There is a best answer for each example, but the option you choose is correct if your rationale is correct. T: You will have 10 minutes to work on this with a partner.  S: (Complete practice activity with partner.) T: (Set timer. Give two-minute warning.) T: Now that you have finished, turn to another pair, and discuss your responses.  S: (Turn and talk to a new pair.) |  |
| 4 mins | Debrief  T: Today we discussed some specific activities that are used by school districts and schools to support teacher growth within the school. Not all schools or school districts will have the same activities or the same plans because student growth looks different for every school and district. What are systems for teacher growth? S:  Schools and districts create different programs and activities to help teachers grow as practitioners, to learn new or refine current skills and knowledge of practice and enable capacity building. It is the commitment to improving.    T: Why do school districts have plans for teacher growth? S: To help teachers improve their skills and problem-solve to support student growth.  T: Correct. There are many ways to receive continuing education and support teacher growth – some of that is through CPEs, some of that can be done by taking courses or getting a degree, and others are done within the school and school system.  T: (Review responses for scenarios.) S: (Student response in green in student guide.) T: Did anyone have a different response for any of the activities? S: Student responses may vary but may include:  Number four I thought could be a good example for Action Research so teachers could compare outcomes and do this activity a few different times to see if the outcomes change. This would still help them solve the problem and learn a new skill and help student outcomes.  T: You are correct – I think the most important idea is that teachers are solving problems, improving their skills, and growing, and supporting student growth. | Student Guide |
