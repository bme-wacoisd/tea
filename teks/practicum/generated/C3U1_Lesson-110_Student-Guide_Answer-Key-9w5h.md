Bellringer:
A teacher shortage exists in education. There are some areas identified as hard to staff such as special education, math, and science classrooms. Why might it be more difficult to fill these positions?
Responses may vary but may include:
- It is harder to get licensed as a special education teacher.
- Not too many people want to teach math because it is hard.
- You can make more money as a scientist than a science teacher.
- There are different requirements for these teachers and so it is harder to get your degree.
