### Tool Name: Formative Assessment Strategies

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Observe and reflect on strategies for the implementation of informal formative assessments.
Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to observe the use of informal formative assessments and consider various implementation strategies and their impact.
Summary:  Students may use this tool to observe a lesson or series of lessons to record data about which informal formative assessments are used, how students respond to those knowledge checks, and how the teacher uses those data during instruction. Additionally, students are invited to develop their own informal formative assessment and, with permission of the field site campus teacher, deploy the assessment. Finally, students are asked to reflect upon how informal formative assessments are connected to learning and classroom management principles.
