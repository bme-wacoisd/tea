| Ms. Burnette is a kindergarten teacher whose class has difficulty calming down following lunch and recess. Her class has not responded to the changes she has attempted to make. She is growing restless and feels like she’s getting more frustrated with students than she used to be. | Preparation: Ms. Burnette takes a mindfulness training to help students center, calm down, and refocus after recess and lunch. She can implement this in her class to help them refocus and for her to feel calmer. Following the implementation, she feels more prepared and feels more patient with her class. |
| Mr. Jenkins is a new sixth grade social studies teacher at his school. He had a sixth-grade social studies teacher who created hands-on lessons for each class period and this teacher inspired him to become a teacher. Mr. Jenkins wants to the same for his students. He’s finding it difficult to balance work with his personal life because he is spending hours and hours creating lessons and the materials for them. He’s feeling exhausted and stressed. | Mentoring: Mr. Jenkins’ mentor teacher, Mr. Behm, has been teaching the same subject for twenty years. He gives Mr. Jenkins some examples of engaging lessons to help him feel less stressed about planning. He also offers him some tips on how to plan more efficiently and where to find high-quality curriculum Mr. Jenkins takes his advice and he now feels like he has a good balance between his personal life |
| Dr. Butler is the lead of the Ninth Grade Academy at her high school and the teachers are having difficulty with students completing their homework. Many of the teachers have spoken to Dr. Butler about feeling like they can’t get their students to do anything, and it makes them feel like failures. | Teacher Collaboration: Dr. Butler ___________ ______________________________________ and discuss different ways teachers have had successes to get students to complete work. The teachers of the Ninth Grade Academy now feel like they have more tools. They have these discussions once a month to check-in and see what has and has not worked for teachers. ______________________________________ |


| Scenario 1: Mrs. Johnson is a new teacher and teaches 9th through 12th grade students who have experienced emotional trauma but does not have a strong background on this subset of students. Throughout the year, she has felt that one class is challenging because of one student and how that student eggs on others. This particular student has regular verbal outbursts during class, can be a bully to other students and even sometimes Mrs. Johnson, and at other times ignores Mrs. Johnson all together and will do her ‘own thing.’ This causes the other students to act out and copy that student. Mrs. Johnson told another teacher she’s felt like she’s done everything she can think of to help this student behave – changed seating, planned different activities for the student, talked to her parents, talked to her about her behavior – and nothing has changed. Mrs. Johnson feels like she’s at the end of her rope and is ready to give up. She is tired and feels like she doesn’t care about that class or student anymore. |

| Scenario 2:  Ms. Elrod is an Algebra teacher of a class with students who have varying abilities and is struggling to differentiate her materials for her students. She finds that she’s spending hours working and cannot find the time to dedicate to her other classes. There are other teachers in the Math Department that teach Algebra and have taught Algebra in the past, and she knows that they could be helpful to her, but she does not want to burden other teachers. She is not sure what she should do because if she keeps going the way she is, she is going to neglect her other students and neglect herself. |

| Scenario 3:  Mr. Limon is a new teacher, and he is leading a series of parent-teacher conferences for the second time this year. He had a few in the beginning of the year that went poorly and he’s feeling anxious. He’s been thinking about these parent-teacher conferences for weeks and is so anxious, he’s getting headaches and feeling physically ill. He feels alone in this and that everyone else seems so natural. |
|  |
| Scenario 4:  There is a natural disaster in the community, and students are feeling distressed and stressed at school. Some students lost their homes and a few lost loved ones. Some are afraid of coming to school or being separated from their parents for a long period of time. A majority of the teachers are unsure of what to do and how to respond. They are struggling with helping their students and it is making many of the teachers feel sad for their students and feel sad for themselves because they cannot support their students with their mental health needs. |

| Scenario 5:  Ms. Camarillo is an English teacher and has taught at the same high school for several years. She loves teaching English and especially loves teaching novels. During the pandemic when classes shifted to virtual setting, she found that several of her students were not reading their books and able to complete class assignments. Additionally, many students would come into class but not turn on their cameras or engage. She felt depressed about this because one of her favorite parts of teaching is not just teaching novels but engaging in conversation with her students and learning their points-of-view. She was worried about many of her students and their mental health. She felt alone and did not know what to do. |
