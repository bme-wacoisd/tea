| Objectives | Compare text-dependent questions to text-related questions. Identify examples and nonexamples of text-dependent questions. Revise text-related questions to make them text-dependent | Compare text-dependent questions to text-related questions. Identify examples and nonexamples of text-dependent questions.

| Rationale/ Summary | Text-dependent questions are those that can only be answered with evidence from an accompanying text. These questions can take various forms (multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, short answer, etc.). While text-dependent questions can ask students to identify important information in a text, they should also push students to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate the text. | Text-dependent questions are those that can only be answered with evidence from an accompanying text.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Read the passage and following questions. For each question, identify whether it is an example of a text-dependent question or not. For each question that is not text-dependent, suggest a revision to make the question depend on the text.  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Read the passage and following questions. For each question, identify whether it is an example of a text-dependent question or not.

| 5 mins | Bellringer: Read the scenario and three prompts below. Complete the chart that follows. Mr. S.’s class just finished reading a poem about the author’s childhood in Alaska. Prompt #1: What was the author’s favorite part about growing up in Alaska? Prompt #2: Which of the following poetic techniques is used by the author? Alliteration Metaphor Hyperbole Simile Prompt #3: Do you want to move far away from where you live now? Why or why not? | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Text-Dependent Questions T: During our last class, we discussed evidence-based writing. Who can define that?  S: It is writing activities that engage students in using information from what they have learned to support their answers to prompts.  T: Your bellringer asked you to consider three prompts that a teacher might use after students read a poem. You had to identify what of each prompt is an example of evidence-based writing. What did you write for Prompt #1, and why did you write it?  S: That one is evidence-based writing because the student must use information from the text to support their answer.  T: How about for Prompt #2?  S: It is evidence-based writing. The student must use text from the poem to answer the question.  T: And Prompt #3?  S: It is not evidence-based writing. It is sort of related to the poem, but a student can answer it without even reading it.  T: Today, we are going to build on our understanding of evidence-based writing to discuss text-dependent questions. There are some similarities between the two, but also some important differences.  T: A text-dependent question can only be answered with evidence from an accompanying text.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: High-quality text-dependent questions share some common characteristics. They assess students’ understanding of what they have read, as well as their ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate the text; focus on language from the text, as well as larger ideas, themes, or events; and  emphasize difficult portions of the text to enhance student comprehension.  S: (Add characteristics to list in Student Guide.)  T: Evidence-based writing shares these characteristics with text-dependent questions. However, there is one key difference. Evidence-based writing requires students to write their responses to prompts. An additional characteristic of text-dependent questions is that there are multiple formats, including multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer.  S: (Add characteristics to list in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Practice 1: Identifying Text-Dependent Questions T: As a class, we are going to look at some example questions and identify whether each is text dependent.  T: Look at the first question about the book in your Student Guide. Miss Franny was afraid of Winn-Dixie at first. What is something you used to be afraid of? What changed your mind?  T: Is this a text-dependent question? Who can answer and explain their thinking?  S: (Circle the appropriate answer in Student Guide.)  S: It is not because the student does not need to use the text to answer it.  T: How could we revise it to be a text-dependent question?  S: (Add revised question to Student Guide.)  S: Answers may vary but may include: You could ask about why Miss Franny is afraid of Winn-Dixie.  T: That is a strong suggestion. Why would that be a text-dependent question?  S: Because the student needs to use the text to figure out why she is scared.  T: Great! We will look at one more example; it is in your Student Guide.  T: The questions about The House on Mango Street are all text dependent. They all require the student to use the text to answer. What other characteristics of high-quality text-dependent questions do they demonstrate?  S: One of them is a fill-in-the-blank type of question. The student does not need to write their entire response.  T: Any other characteristics?  S: The second and third questions are asking about bigger ideas, like one of the character’s feelings. They are not asking about details like the first question is.  T: Good job. Any other characteristics?  S: For the first question, the answer is not right in the text. The student must use information from the text to try to figure it out.  T: Excellent! You have listed some of the important characteristics of text-dependent questions. | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Practice 2: Identifying Text-Dependent Questions with a Partner T: Next, we will spend some time examining other texts and associated questions. You will be working in a pair with another student sitting near you. Let us take a few moments and have everyone move so that partners are sitting together.  T: (Help place students into pairs and form triads if needed).  T: Review each selection and subsequent set of questions in your Student Guide. For each question, identify whether it is text-dependent or not. If it is not, work with your partner to revise the question to shift it into a text-dependent question.   T: Begin your conversations!  S: (Work in pairs to complete practice activity in Student Guide.)  T: We are going to come back together as a group and briefly review our answers.  T: For the first passage, the selection on the White Ribboners, which question is text-dependent, and which one is not?  S: The second one is text-dependent, and the first one is not.  T: Great! For the next selection, the poem, which question is text-dependent, and which one is not?  S: The first one is text-dependent, and the second one is not.  T: And the last selection, about Plunkett Hall, which question is text-dependent, and which one is not?  S: The second one is text-dependent, and the first one is not.  T: Great! Would anyone like to ask for clarification on why any of the questions are text-dependent or not?  S: (Ask clarifying questions, as needed.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Let us review what we learned. |  |
