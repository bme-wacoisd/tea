Notes: Introduction to Effective Communication during Conflict



Modeling: Professional Communication with Parents & Families

Scenario:
Simpson Jones is a student in Mr. Tomlin’s 3rd grade classroom.  Mr. Tomlin knows that Simpson is an extremely bright student who excels in class, especially with anything related to Math.   However, Mr. Tomlin has noticed that Simpson can be especially forgetful as well.  Often, Simpson has not completed his homework when he comes to class or has forgotten it at home.  As a result, he is currently missing several grades, which has resulted in a lower-than-expected grade for Simpson in Mr. Tomlin’s class.  Mr. Tomlin hopes to address this issue with Simpson’s dad when he attends the parent teacher conference.

Script for the Role Play

Mr. Tomlin: (Sit at table in classroom.)
Mr. Jones: (Walk up to the table where Mr. Tomlin is sitting.)

Mr. Tomlin: Mr. Jones?  Hi, I’m Mr. Tomlin, Simpson’s 3rd grade teacher.  I appreciate you meeting with me today.  I was hoping we could talk about Simpson’s progress in my class.  Simpson is an extremely bright student but there are a couple of things that I would love to talk to you about that might help him to be even more successful in my class this year.

Mr. Jones: It is nice to meet you Mr. Tomlin.

Mr. Tomlin: Before I share my thoughts, I would love for you to share how you think that Simpson has been doing this year so far in school.

Mr. Jones: I think he has been doing ok.  He seems to like school enough and he often tells me about things that you are doing in class that he is excited about.  He did mention though that his grade isn’t very good right now.
Mr. Tomlin: I’m glad you mentioned that.  I agree that Simpson seems to enjoy class and he is always participating.  He is especially gifted in Math where he often is finishing his work well ahead of the other students.  I have even started to give him additional more challenging problems to work on after he finishes his work, and it seems he likes the challenge.  As for the grade I think that is something we should talk about today.

Mr. Tomlin: Lately I am noticing that Simpson has been a bit forgetful.  There have been several times that he has not completed his homework and when I ask him why he is saying he just forgot to do it.  As a result, the missing homework grades are making his overall grade much lower that it should be.

Mr. Jones: That is interesting because when we ask Simpson about homework, he always says he doesn’t have any.

Mr. Tomlin:  That is interesting.  Every day at the end of class we have the students write down their homework on in their class journal.  I know that he has been doing that in class each day.  Maybe to help him remember to do his homework, we could set a goal for him to come home each day and show you the journal so you can help him to remember his homework.
Mr. Jones: That sounds like a great plan.  And if he doesn’t share the journal with me, I know that I can ask him about it.

Mr. Tomlin: Great.  I think if Simpson begins completing his homework and turning it in you are going to see a great improvement in his grade.  Do you have any other questions or concerns you would like to share with me Mr. Jones?

Mr. Jones: No, I think this sounds like a great plan.  I appreciate all your work with Simpson this year.

Mr. Tomlin: Great, well I very much appreciate your time today Mr. Jones.  If you have any questions at any time, please do not hesitate to reach out by email and/or phone.  My information is on this sheet of paper. (Hands Mr. Jones a piece of paper.)


Where did you see evidence of the steps of the parent conference in this role play?

Practice: Effective Communication through Conflict Role Play
Scenario 1:  Mr. Freedman is a 7th grade science teacher.  He has a student, Maribel, that comes into his first period class every day and proceeds to put her head down and go to sleep.  When he asks Maribel about it, she tells him she is so sleepy every morning because she is staying up late every night trying to get her schoolwork done.  Maribel is an excellent student in all classes, but she really shines in science.  She is a great lab partner.  She takes her time helping to explain concepts to her group members and does an excellent job including everyone in the discussions.  The problem is, she can’t do this when she is asleep.  Mr. Freedman has scheduled a parent teacher conference with her parents to discuss his concerns.

Scenario 2:  Mrs. Applewhite is a 5th grade teacher.  Tomas is a student in Ms. Applewhite’s class this year.  Tomas loves to read and spends as much time as possible every day in reading his books alone. Most of the books he is reading are well above his grade level.  Recently, Mrs. Applewhite has noticed that Tomas is rushing through his work to be able to read his books.  He isn’t answering his questions in full sentences in language arts or showing his work on math and science problems.  This is leading to lower-than-expected scores for Tomas.  Mrs. Applewhite is concerned with Tomas’ progress and has scheduled a conference with his mother to discuss his progress.

Homework
Interview your field site teacher to find out how they plan for, conduct, and follow up with parent conferences.  Reflect on how their process aligns with the steps of a parent conference discussed in our class today.

| Parent-Teacher Conference |  |
| --- | --- |


| Key Steps | Example | Why is this important? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Greet the parents and establish a common purpose for the conference | “It is great to see you Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez.  Thank you for taking time to meet with me.  We are both here because we want the best Alex.  Today let’s talk about Alex’s academic progress in my class so far this year.” |  |
| Invite the parents to share their thoughts on how the student is doing | “Based on what you are hearing and experiencing with Alex, how do you think he is doing so far this year?” |  |
| Share positive feedback about the student | “Alex is an incredible classmate.  When he sees someone else struggling or upset, he is the first one to ask what he can do to help.” |  |
| Share no more than 2 areas of improvement | “Sometimes Alex struggles because he wants to rush through his work to get to talk with his classmates.  This can lead to Alex making silly mistakes.  Also, it sometimes can be a distraction for other students who don’t work as fast as Alex.” |  |
| Set a goal for the student with the parents | “Alex could improve his work by slowing down and taking the time to review his work after he finishes.” |  |
| Ask the parents if they have any questions | “Do you have any other questions about Alex’s progress or what we discussed in the conference today?” |  |
| Thank the parents for their time and provide contact information again | “I appreciate your time today.  Please don’t hesitate to reach out with the information I provided on the conference sheet if you have questions at any time.” |  |
