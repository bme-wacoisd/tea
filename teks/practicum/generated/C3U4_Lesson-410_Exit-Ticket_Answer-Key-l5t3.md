### Lesson 4.10: Remediating, Accelerating, and Just-in-Time Supports

Name:
Date:
Explain the difference between remediation and acceleration, including how they can lead to different results for students.
Teachers use remediation to review or reteach old material before moving onto grade-level content. Acceleration also involves review or reteaching but does so alongside grade-level content. When teachers focus on remediating all previous content before moving onto any grade-level content, it can prevent students from catching up, since that time takes away from the content, they should be learning that year. Acceleration can support students in closing gaps in skills or knowledge while still pushing them to learn content that is grade-level appropriate.
How do just-in-time interventions support students in accessing grade level content?
Just-in-time supports provide students with specific interventions on skills or knowledge that contribute to their success on grade-level content. By providing students with review of skills necessary to be successful on the current unit immediately before they would use those skills, they allow students to both practice and apply them to what they should be learning at that grade-level.
