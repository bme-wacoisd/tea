| 5 mins | Modeling: Effective Written Communication  T: In the next section of your student guide, you have two examples of written communication by a teacher to a student – one not effective, and one effective. Please take a moment and read the first example of “Not effective.” Use the rubric above to guide your understanding.   S: (Read Not Effective Scenario model silently.)  T: Why is this example ineffective? Record your responses in the space below.   S: This is not effective because it is not clear and does not answer the question, it does not have professional content because it talks about her dog, it is informal, and there are grammatical and spelling errors.  T: Now read the second example and think about how this is more effective in comparison.   S: (Read Effective Written Communication model silently.)  T: What was effective about the second example?  S: The teacher was professional and on topic, and she answered all the questions. | Student Guide |

Using the rubric provided for you in the student guide, rate the effectiveness 1-5 of the written communication with 1 being not effective and 5 being very effective. Use the space provided to give a few reasons why it is or is not effective. Suggest how to improve the effectiveness.   T: Now that you have spent a few minutes reviewing these different written communications, turn and talk to a partner about your different ratings and discuss your suggested improvements.   S: (Complete exercise in Student Guide with a partner.) T: Now that you have had a chance to talk with a partner about your ratings, can one group share with me their rating for the first example and any suggestions for improvement their made?
