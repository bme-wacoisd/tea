Remember, each group should have at least three examples of teaching stressors and strategies for dealing with those stressors.   T: Refer to the presentation rubric in your Student Guide for a reminder as to how your presentation will be scored. Let’s look at it now for clarification or any questions.  T: The first category is accuracy of information. That means that the information you present is factual, not based on opinions, and if necessary, you cite your sources.  T: Next is how the project is organized. This means that as you present material, it is sequential and has a flow that makes sense.  T: Use of presentation materials means that you have appropriate visual aids or materials to clearly present information in a way that is accessible to your audience.  T: The category for voice means that you’re using a voice and pace that are appropriate for your audience and are not using excessive filler words such as “like” or “um.” T: Your body language should demonstrate engagement with your audience as well as a comfort level with the content. Make sure you stand up straight and show confidence—remember, you’re the expert!  T: Lastly, audience engagement is a crucial part of any presentation. You want to ensure your audience is paying attention and is connected to the material you’re presenting. Finding ways to use questioning strategies or otherwise interact with the audience can increase their engagement.   T: Are there any questions?  S: (Ask questions, if any.) | Student Guide |
