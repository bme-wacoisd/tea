### Lesson 4.12: Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction

Name:
Date:
Bellringer:
Mark the following as true or false.

___ T ___ Teachers must balance procedural and conceptual math instruction to build greater understanding of math concepts.

___ F ___ If students cannot perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division from memory, they cannot be successful with more advanced math concepts.

___ F ___ When students do not understand a lesson, it is best to reteach that lesson the next day to give students more “at-bats.”

___ T ___ The most effective math interventions tie review of foundational skills into grade-level content.

Instruction: Common Pitfalls in Math Instruction Notes

Practice: Identifying Strategies to Overcome Instructional Pitfalls
With a partner, consider the following scenarios related to each pitfall. Identify which pitfall is at play and, using the prior knowledge developed throughout this unit, suggest an alternative approach for that teacher and explain why it is important for them to take a different approach.

Consider the intervention you are planning within your internship class. What pitfall are you most concerned about falling into with your planning? Why?
Responses will vary.

How might you address this pitfall?

Responses will vary.



| Pitfall | Description | Challenges it Presents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Too much Remediation | Prioritizing below grade-level content | Prevents students from accessing grade-level content and may lead students to have a negative association with Math. |
| Procedural Instruction | Focusing on procedures to speed up instruction. | When students only have procedural knowledge of math concepts, they lack a true understanding of WHY these procedures work, limiting their ability to apply this knowledge in different contexts. |
| Prioritizing Fluency Practice | Focusing on student understanding of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division at the expense of grade level content. | Pulls students away from deeper conceptual knowledge and grade-level content. |
| Repeating the First Teach | Reteaching content the same way again to provide more “at-bats.” | Does not directly address student misconceptions and does not allow for multiple methods of engagement. |


| Example | Pitfall | Alternative (With Rationale) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ms. A’s students are struggling to quickly and accurately complete multi-step equations because they do not have their multiplication and division facts memorized. She decides to dedicate in-class time for students to just practice memorizing multiplication and division every day for the next two weeks. | Prioritizing Fluency Practice | Mr. A should include fluency related just-in-time interventions in his planning so that students still get the practice, but it does not take away from grade-level instruction. |
| Ms. L decided to focus on teaching her students step-by-step instructions for subtracting two- and three-digit numbers because that is how she learned, and it is faster than the way her curriculum explains the concept. | Procedural Instruction | Ms. L should include more conceptual understanding in her lesson planning to ensure that students can fully understand the WHY behind math concepts and be better prepared to apply it to new problems. |
| When Ms. Q’s students did not master her lesson on multiplying fractions, she decided to use the same lesson the next day (with switching out the numbers in the practice problems) and teach it again. | Repeating the First Teach | Ms. Q should consider UDL approach and present the information in multiple ways. She could consider abstract or representational approaches to increase conceptual understanding. |
| Based on pre-test data, Mr. E. noticed that his class has not mastered the third grade TEKS necessary to succeed in his next unit, so he decides to cover those standards before he moves to grade level content. | Too much Remediation | Mr. E. should Provide just-in-time interventions prior to addressing related grade-level content so that the remediation is targeted and timely. |
