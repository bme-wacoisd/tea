Read the following scenario and answer the questions that follow.
Mr. R. is working on a word problem with a group of students. They need to use the information in the problem to set up an equation, which they then need to solve. They are stuck on how to set up the equation, so Mr. R. tells them what the equation needs to be. The students say that they do not know how to solve the problem. He gives them time to solve the problem before checking their work. Three of the students answered correctly, but one got the incorrect answer. Mr. R. points out the correct steps the student took to solve the equation and praises them before asking them to double-check their work on the steps they completed incorrectly.
- When did the teacher engage the student in productive struggle?
The teacher gave the students time to solve the equation even though they said they did not know how. He also praised the student who answered the question incorrectly for the steps he did complete correctly.
- When did the teacher miss opportunities to engage students in productive struggle? What could they have done differently?
He should not have given them the equation. He could have asked them questions to help them develop the equations themselves.
