Answer the following questions based on your small group discussion.

What is the most challenging part of implementing a just-in-time intervention? What additional supports would be helpful for a teacher in planning a just-in-time intervention?

Responses will vary.

Why is it important for teacher to use just-in-time interventions when providing grade-level content for all students?
Just-in-time supports provide students with help on specific topics or concepts that will be important to master grade-level content. Providing students with these supports can build their confidence and ensure that they can understand the new content. Without them, students will not be able to grasp the content, and will fall further behind.
