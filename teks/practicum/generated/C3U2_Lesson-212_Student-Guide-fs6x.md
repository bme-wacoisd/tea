Name:

Bellringer:
A teacher is concerned about several of her students who are learning English as a second language. They are falling behind in class and becoming frustrated. She speaks with a representative from a local tutoring program. The program is free and offers quality after-school tutoring for students struggling in reading. The representative asks for more information about the students, including their recent state test scores. The teacher has reservations about sharing this information but decides it's in the student's best interest.
Is this teacher acting ethically?

Instruction: Responding to Ethical Dilemmas
Simple considerations for ethical decisions

Scenario: Mr. Carlos is a veteran teacher who is popular with his students. He often offers extra help after school. Mr. Carlos is tutoring one of his students, Thomas after school currently. Thomas has been a student in several of Mr. Carlos’s classes over the last two years. During this time Mr. Carlos has emailed and texted Thomas’ cellphone using his personal number and email address. At first the exchanges were very general and focused on school-related topics such as progress in class and participation on sports teams. Lately, Thomas has started to text Mr. Carlos more about his personal life and feelings.

| Mr. Massing’s friend recently applied for a teaching position at the school where he works, and asked Mr. Massing to help him prepare for his upcoming job interview. Mr. Massing really wants his friend to get the job and found the interview questions for the position for which his friend will be interviewed sitting on the copy machine. | Ms. Singh is taking her school’s National Honor Society on a trip to Florida for a conference. Because of the size of the trip, she must solicit bids from travel companies for airline travel and lodging. One company offers a generous “under the table” deal: “If you choose our travel agency for the Florida trip, we will give you a discount on your next vacation.” This company’s bid is only $100 more than the lowest bid. | Mr. Davis stayed late at school one afternoon to finish grading essays. As he was leaving school around 5pm he noticed one of his students still waiting outside the front door. The student shared that they were still waiting for their ride and were concerned that their mom got held up at work. The student asks Mr. Davis for a ride home. |

| Every year, Ms. Cheshire helps administer STAAR testing at her school. The state provides strict guideless for the testing room, including barring use of cell phone or other electronic devices during the test. Students found using a cell phone during the test will have them confiscated and will be investigated for cheating. Near the end of the testing period, she sees a student looking at their phone under their desk. It appears the student has completed their test and is reading on their phone. | Ms. McCoy is holding auditions during class for solos in her school’s upcoming chorus concert. She presented students with a rubric in advance so they knew how they would be evaluated during their auditions and told students whomever scored highest on the audition rubric would be awarded the solo. After tallying the scores, the student who scored the highest on the rubric is one that Ms. McCoy does not get along with, so she’s considering giving the solo to the student with the second highest score instead. | Last week, Mr. Brady walked past the classroom of a new teacher and observed that the class is out of control. Students are being disruptive and there does not appear to be any learning going on. After witnessing the same issues over the following days, Mr. Brady offered to help this teacher, but the teacher refused saying they would handle her own class in her own way. Mr. Brady could refer the matter to an administrator but does not want to cause an issue or somehow endanger the teacher’s ongoing employment. On the other hand, if he does not act, it is possible that student learning will remain limited, and these children will fall behind. |
