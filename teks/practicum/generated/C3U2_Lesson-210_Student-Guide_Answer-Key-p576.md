Guided Practice: Scenarios on Ethics
Mr. Jones is walking by another classroom when he hears a teacher getting sick. He sticks his head into the classroom and asks if she needs any help. The teacher apologizes and says that she is taking medication for a serious medical condition and that it makes her nauseous. Mr. Jones wants to make sure that this teacher gets the help she needs, so he tells the principal and the other teachers who have classrooms in that hallway.
Is Mr. Jones acting in an ethical manner based on the Code of Ethics for Texas Educators?
He is not because he told people about another teacher’s medical condition.

What are some of the potential negative consequences for the teachers?
It could put the other teacher in an uncomfortable situation if other people know personal information about her that she did not want to share.

How could Mr. Jones have acted more ethically?
He could have checked in on the teacher more frequently to see if she needs any help. He could also encourage her to share her medical struggles with her colleagues so that everyone can help support her.


Practice: Scenarios on Ethics


| Scenario | Is the teacher acting ethically? Why or why not? | What are some of the potentially negative consequences for those involved? | How could the teacher have acted more ethically? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ms. Truman teaches 12th grade English. Several of her students are interested in attending the college that she graduated from, which is located about an hour away from the school. She offers to take a few students there to see a football game if they meet her at the school at 10:00 am on a Saturday morning. | Ms. Truman is not acting ethically. She did not ask for permission from her students’ parents, and she did not tell the school administration that she was taking the students to the college. Also, she is transporting the students in her own car. | Students’ parents could become concerned if they cannot find their children during the trip to the college. There is no one other than Ms. Truman to support the students if something goes wrong during the field trip, such as medical emergency. Depending on the school district’s policies, Ms. Truman could face negative consequences for her behavior. | Ms. Truman should have worked with the school counselor to organize a field trip to visit the college. As an official school field trip, she would collect parent permission slips, there would be more than one chaperone, and students would ride a school bus. |
| Mr. Madison is filling out a form to be reimbursed for some school supplies that he bought for his classroom. He’s been working at night and on the weekends to provide high-quality instruction for his students, and he’s disappointed that he doesn’t get extra pay for this work. While he only spent $75 on supplies, he submits a reimbursement form for $125. | Mr. Madison is not acting ethically. He did not spend $125 on supplies and asking for reimbursement for that amount is fraud. | Mr. Madison can face negative consequences for lying on his form. The school loses money that could have been used to purchase supplies for students. | Mr. Madison should have filled out the reimbursement form for $75 only. |
| Ms. Hamilton is an elementary school teacher running in an election to join the district’s school board. Several of her colleagues have heard her speak negatively about students and their families, and they’re worried about the decisions she might make if she is elected. They begin removing her campaign signs from around town. | The teachers are not acting ethically. They cannot prevent Ms. Hamilton from campaigning for office. | The teachers can face negative consequences for removing the campaign signs. Ms. Hamilton may not win the election because her signs have been removed. | If they are residents of the school district, the teachers can vote against Ms. Hamilton. They can also show their support for other candidates publicly, as well as speak out about why they do not feel that Ms. Hamilton will be a good board member. |
