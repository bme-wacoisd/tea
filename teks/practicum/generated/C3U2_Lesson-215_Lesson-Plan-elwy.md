| TEKS | 2 | The student will identify strategies that promote health and wellness in balancing unique challenges of educator and lifestyle responsibilities. The student is expected to:  (A) analyze current trends and issues that impact education such as political, societal, and economic trends and issues;   (B) demonstrate and implement knowledge and skills needed by the teaching and training profession;  (C) update assessment of personal characteristics needed to work in the teaching and training profession |

| Rationale/ Summary | Professional burnout and teacher burnout can be managed through personal strategies, as well as systemic strategies that are put in place by a work place. Teachers can learn personal strategies to help them meet challenges such as behavior management strategies and organizational strategies. Schools can equally provide teachers with systemic strategies such as schoolwide training and resources, mentoring programs and opportunities to collaborate with teachers. These methods can help create a balance between the external factors impacting a teacher and the personal difficulties they may face. | Professional burnout and teacher burnout can be managed through personal strategies, as well as systemic strategies that are put in place by a work place.

| 4 mins | Bellringer:  Using your notes from the previous day:  What is teacher burnout? What are stressors that cause teacher burnout? Why is it important to prevent teacher burnout? | Student Guide |
| 3 mins | Debrief: T:  You will turn and talk to a partner to discuss your answers for these three questions. You have two minutes.  S: (Turn and talk to partner.)   T: Let’s review as a class. What is teacher burnout?  S:  A state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, detachment, and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.  T: What are stressors that cause teacher burnout?  S: 1. School Organizations that lack strong principal leadership, a healthy school climate and a collegial, supportive environment.   2. Job Demands that are escalating with high-stakes testing, student behavioral problems, and difficult parents.    3. Work Resources that limit a teacher’s sense of autonomy and decision-making power.     4. Teacher Social and Emotional Competence to manage stress and nurture a healthy classroom.    T: Why is it important to prevent teacher burnout?  S:Teacher burnout directly affects students because it leads to lower job performance and more teachers leaving the field. | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Preventing Teacher Burnout T: Today, we will discuss how to prevent teacher burnout. You discussed during your bellringer why it is important to prevent it or recognize it before it happens. There are many ways to prevent it, including personal stress reduction and tools – you will discuss this in another lesson.  Today, we are going to discuss systemic support to prevent teacher burnout. Systemic support are personal structures in place, as well as preventions that are in place at the school level. Please refer to your Student Guide as we work through notes.   T: (Project with PowerPoint.)  T: What are systemic supports to prevent teacher burnout?  S: Personal or physical strategies to prepare a teacher for challenges, as well as tools, resources, and structures in place in a school or district to help teachers and make them feel a culture of trust and support in their professional setting.  T: Why do schools have systemic supports?  S: Professional environments and organizational systems can sometimes cause teacher burnout. Schools create systems of support to prevent burnout, help teachers feel respected and trusted, and to help teachers find ways to solve problems early-on.  T: What are examples of systemic supports?  S: Teacher preparation (training and material resources), mentoring programs, and teacher collaboration. T: Please move on to the chart below and we will fill out the types and examples of systemic support. I will project the responses on the board – please copy them.  T: (Projects responses on the board.) S: (Copy responses.) | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 6 mins | Model: Preventing Teacher Burnout T: I am going to model examples and thinking around how to assess the effectiveness of systemic supports and why they are necessary. Can someone please read example 1?  T: (Call on student.)  S: Ms. Burnette is a kindergarten teacher whose class has difficulty calming down following lunch and recess. Her class has not responded to the changes she has attempted to make. She is growing restless and feels like she’s getting more frustrated with students than she used to be.  T: While I read the explanation, I am going to highlight important key phrases and my thinking process. I am first going to choose from my list which method I think to be the most effective for this example. I read through the definitions provided in the notes and think to myself: “preparation will be the most useful for Mrs. Burnette to help her find some personal practices to manage external conditions.”   I then think to myself that a training will help her learn tools to prepare for the class and feeling calmer.   T: Preparation: Ms. Burnette takes a course for behavior management (underline) to help her students refocus and gives her a set of more explicit rules to manage her class after recess and lunch. She can implement this in her class (underline) to help them refocus and for her to feel calmer. Following the implementation, she feels more prepared and feels more patient with her class. (Underline).  I underlined activity and the outcome.   S: (Underline what teacher underlines.)  T: Number two? (Call on student.)   S: (Reads number 2.)  T: (Underline the activities and the positive outcome.)  S: (Underlines what teacher underlines.)  T: Number three? (Call on student.)   S: (Reads number 3.)   T: For this response, on your own, underline the activities and the outcomes.   S: (Underline activities and outcomes.)   T: Can someone share what they underlined?  S: I underlined the phrase “brings teachers together to discuss their problems” and “teachers feel more confident in their teaching.”   T: Well done. | Student Guide |
| 12 mins | Stations: Preventing Teacher Burnout  T: There are five stations around the classroom including five different scenarios of teacher burnout. (Point to stations around the room.) You will make a suggestion of the three different types of systemic burnout prevention - collaboration, mentoring, or preparation – that could help prevent a teacher from experiencing burnout. Provide your rationale as to why you believe it to be the best reason.   You will have two minutes at each station. At two minutes you will rotate to the next station. If you finish early, please use the time to expand on your rationale. Are there any questions?  S: (Ask clarifying questions.)   T: (Answer clarifying questions.)   T: (Divide students to stations.) You have ten minutes, you may begin. (Set ten-minute timer.)   S: (Go to first station. Rotate every two minutes.)   T: (Remind students to rotate every two minutes.)   T: The timer is up. Please return to your seats and we will discuss your responses. |  |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: (Read Scenario 1.)   S: (Share response.)   T: (Read Scenario 2.)  S: (Share response.)  T: (Read Scenario 3.)  S: (Share response.)  T: (Read Scenario 4.)   S: (Share response.)   T: (Read Scenario 5.)   T: (Share response.)   T: How will these prevent burnout?  S: They will prevent burnout by helping solve problems before they get too difficult and help teachers feel supported. | Student Guide |
