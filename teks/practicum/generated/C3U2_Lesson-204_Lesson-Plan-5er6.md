| Rationale/ Summary | The maxim, “You only get one chance to make a first impression” - while is not always true - has great meaning when it comes to the classroom. The first day with students in the classroom as teacher is one of the most important days of the year. It sets the tone for the semester and establishes the environment in which students will learn for the year. It gives students the opportunity to get to know the class, the teacher, and the other students. Students will learn the components of an effective and positive introduction speech by a teacher to students. They will use these components to create their own speech to welcome students to their classroom and create a safe classroom, establish class expectations and goals for the year, and provide some personal background and goals to the students. | The maxim, “You only get one chance to make a first impression” - while is not always true - has great meaning when it comes to the classroom.

| Lesson Preparation | You will be modeling a “First Day Introductory Speech to Students” for the students in this class. The speech will need to be approximately 8 minutes and include: A Welcome, Class Expectations/Rules and Goals, and Brief Background on yourself. The rubric used throughout this lesson should guide your speech and will serve as a model for students as they draft their own introductory speech. |  |
| 4 mins | Bellringer 1. Describe your background (Where are you from? Where did you grow up? Information about your family? Etc.) 2. What are your hobbies and interests? List 3. 3. What is a personal goal of yours for the future? | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Bellringer Review   T: Turn and talk to a partner and share your answers. Pretend you have never met before, and this is your first introduction to one another.  S: (Turn and talk to partner.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Notes: Importance of First Impressions T: You just provided some background on yourself to your classmate. It is important to share some background information with people when you introduce yourself because it helps an individual feel comfortable and familiar with you.   T: Why is it important to feel comfortable or familiar with a person?  S: It’s important so you feel connected to them and that you know something about them. This helps you to get to know them more and want to be around them.   T: Introductions are important, not just with new friends, but for many different parts in the real world and is an important component in your life. The phrase “You never get a second chance at a first impression,” while not always true, has an important meaning. What do you think it means? Take a moment to respond to the space provided in your Student Guide.  S: (Write a brief response.)  T: As a teacher, one of the most important days is your first day and the introduction you make on your first day. Today, you will write your own introduction as a teacher to a class of students on your first day. A teacher’s introduction to the class is important because it sets the tone for the class and the semester, it helps students feel warm and welcome, it sets expectations for the year, and it gives students an opportunity to get to know you as a teacher. It helps them feel safe and familiar. Take a moment and answer the next question in your Student Guide. Why is a teacher introducing themselves to their students important?  S: (Write in Student Guide.)  T: Would anyone like to share a response?  S:  A teacher introducing themselves to their students is important because it helps set the tone for the class and it helps the students feel welcome and warm in the class, sets the expectations for the year, and gives students a chance to get to know you, feel comfortable, and familiar with you.   T: There are three major parts to an introduction. Please write them in your Student Guide.  (Write them on the board.)  S:  1) Creating a warm and welcoming environment; 2) Classroom Expectations and Rules, Grading and Class Goals; 3) Personal Introduction/Background.  T: What makes an effective introductory speech? (Write responses on the board.)  S:  An effective introductory speech is clearly and thoroughly communicated, and it leaves a positive and lasting impression on the students.   T: Take a few minutes to review the “Teacher Introduction Rubric” in your Student Guide. You will keep this in mind while I model a speech for you, and you will use this to guide your own writing.  S: (Review Rubric in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Model: Teacher Introductory Speech Example  T: I am going to model a short introductory speech for you. I will cover the three major parts: Creating a warm and welcoming environment, classroom expectations and rules, and personal background.   T: While you listen, please follow the “Teacher Introductory Speech Example” rubric and write down statements that you hear that might be evidence of the different categories.   T: (Deliver prepared introduction.) | Student Guide |
| 10 mins | Independent Practice: My First Day Introductory Speech  T: You will now have about ten minutes to write your own speech. In your Student Guide, you will find “My First Day Introductory Speech” is divided into three sections. Using my example, the rubric and sentence starter, please write your speech. Are there any questions? S: What if I can’t think of anything for classroom expectations? T: Think about what you’ve seen in other classrooms or from teachers that you appreciate. That will help guide you. In general, think about classrooms where you have felt safe and welcome, and teachers who have set strong expectations and have strong models – keep them in mind while you write.  T: I will set a ten-minute timer. You may begin. (Set timer.) S: (Write speech.) |  |
| 4 mins | Debrief  T: Why are first impressions so important? S: They help set the stage and the tone for the person or people you meet.
