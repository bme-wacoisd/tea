# Lesson-Scaffolding


## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Lesson Scaffolding & Gradual Release

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Design and implement a lesson that is intentionally structured to build student understanding.
- Explore and apply the stages of gradual release of responsibility to scaffold student learning.
- Evaluate and reflect on the impact of scaffolding and gradual release within a lesson plan.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to plot lesson activities on a Gradual Release of Responsibility graphic, to develop and perform a modeling activity, and to reflect on components of both effective and ineffective student practice.
Summary: Students are first asked to observe a lesson or series of lessons and plot lesson activities on the Gradual Release of Responsibility graphic, which includes demonstration (“I do, you watch”), shared demonstration (“I do, you help”), guided practice (“You do, I help”), and independent practice (“You do, I watch”). Next, students are invited to design a modeling activity for future use in a lesson, if appropriate. Finally, students will reflect on the essential characteristics of student practice and what strategies are effective in contrast with examples of ineffective strategies.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 6.07: Scaffolding a Lesson | Intro to Gradual Release
Lesson 6.08: Scaffolding a Lesson | Modeling, Part I
Lesson 6.00: Scaffolding a Lesson | Modeling, Part II
Lesson 6.10: Scaffolding a Lesson | Practice
Connected Instructional Practices TEKS:
- Standard 3: The student explores the teaching and training profession. The student is expected to: (B) summarize and apply pedagogical knowledge and skills needed by teaching and training professionals.
- Standard 6: The student plans and develops effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) explain the role of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills in planning and evaluating instruction; (C) explain the rationale for and process of instructional planning components such as vertical alignment and scope and sequence; and (F) demonstrate lesson planning to meet instructional goals.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and uses effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.
