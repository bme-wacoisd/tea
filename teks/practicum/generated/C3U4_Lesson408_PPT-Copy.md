### Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Unfinished Learning | Knowledge or skills in the TEKS that students haven’t yet mastered |
| Traditional Approach | The teacher modifies lessons for some learners so that they can address unfinished learning, such as giving them different problems than other students. |
| Universal Design for Learning (UDL) | An educational framework to guide the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences through engagement, representation, and expression. UDL minimizes barriers and maximizes learning for all students |
| UDL Guidelines | A set of strategies that can be applied to any subject or grade level to ensure that all learners can access and participate in meaningful, challenging learning opportunities (CAST, 2022). |

### Notes: UDL in Math

- According to a report called the Opportunity Myth (2018), “Students spent more than 500 hours per school year on assignments that weren’t appropriate for their grade and with instruction that didn’t ask enough of them—the equivalent of six months of wasted class time in each core subject…”

## Slide 6

### Notes: UDL in Math (Cont.)

- The study also found that “In classrooms where students had greater access to grade-appropriate assignments, they gained nearly two months of additional learning compared to their peers.”

## Slide 7

### Notes: UDL in Math (Cont. 2)

- 7
- What does multiple means of engagement look like in a classroom?
- Allowing students choice in how they might reach a learning target
- Providing opportunities for students to engage in learning experiences that are relevant and valuable to their goals and individual interests
- Creating a supportive environment where students feel safe to learn and take risks

## Slide 8

### Notes: UDL in Math (Cont. 3)

- 8
- What does multiple means of representation look like in a classroom?
- Offering options for customizing the display of information
- Offering alternatives for auditory information
- Offering alternatives for visual information

---

## Slide 9

### Notes: UDL in Math (Cont. 4)

- 9
- What does multiple means of action and expression look like in a classroom?
- Allowing students to share their learning in different ways
- Providing alternative ways for students to interact with instructional materials and their environment
- Providing access to and support with tools and assistive technologies
- Providing opportunities for students to communicate using multiple forms of media
- Supporting learners in setting challenging and authentic goals
- Provide flexible tools and processes to support organization and memory

## Slide 10

### Practice 1: Guided Example

- 10
- A 6th grade math class is working on the following TEKS:
- 6.4(B) Apply qualitative and quantitative reasoning to solve prediction and comparison of real-world problems involving ratios, rates and proportions.
- The teacher gives her students the following word problem: Jay was paid $190 for a job that required 40 hours of work. At this rate, how much should he be paid for a job requiring 60 hours of work?
- Many of her students were successfully able to complete the word problem, but one student has unfinished learning as he has a hard time operating with fractions. What should the teacher do?

## Slide 12

### Practice 3: Scenarios

- 12
- Students in Mr. P’s 5th grade math class were given the following problem to solve.
- A restaurant bill was paid equally by 7 friends. The bill was $99.96. How much money in dollars and cents did each person pay?
- (STAAR End-of-Grade Assessment in Grade 5 Mathematics, 2022 Released Form)
- Most of the students were able to complete the problem with ease, but one student struggled with decimals. The teacher decided to modify the numbers in the word problem so that the student would only have to solve the problem using whole numbers instead of decimals.
- What is the long-term impact for this student?
- What might a UDL approach look like?

## Slide 13

### Exit Ticket

- In your field site, you may have seen teachers use different UDL practices in math. Now is your opportunity to share the examples of UDL you have seen in your field site or suggest opportunities where UDL could have been used with the class. If you have seen UDL in math during your field experience, describe a few examples and tell the outcome.  If you have not seen teachers use UDL practices in math, provide examples of a few opportunities where they could have done so. How could they have engaged students in a more productive way? How does a UDL approach promote more accessible outcomes for all students?
- You can choose how you want to share your learning. You may choose to write your response, create a video, perform a skit, develop a poster, etc.
