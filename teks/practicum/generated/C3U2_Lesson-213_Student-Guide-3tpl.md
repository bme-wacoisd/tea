Think of a time in your life where you experienced negative stress. What caused the stress? How did you manage that situation?




Create a concept map about what you believe would be stressful about the teaching profession.





Practice 1: Scenarios
Read each scenario below and answer the questions.
Scenario #1: Mrs. Powell
Mrs. Powell has taught sixth grade science for five years. She really loves the science content that is covered in sixth grade, and she enjoys sixth graders. When she first began teaching, Mrs. Powell believed she wanted to teach older middle school students but found that she was able to connect to the sixth graders in a way that made classroom management easy and teaching fun. She has also worked with the same team of teachers for the past five years, so they work very well together. Due to staffing changes, Mrs. Powell’s principal informed her that next school year she would be moving from sixth grade to eighth grade. She will be the second-most veteran teacher on her new team, and her principal is depending on her to be a leader for the less experienced teachers.

Why is this situation stressful?



Is the stress in this situation distress, eustress, or a combination of both? How do you know?




What suggestions would you give Mrs. Powell when considering the stress she is facing?


Scenario #2: Mr. Stewart
Mr. Stewart is a first year, third grade teacher. When he began teaching, he was told that it is important to develop relationships with parents to help manage classroom behaviors. In his letter to parents at the beginning of the school year he included his personal phone number. Within the first few weeks of school, parents began calling or texting him to ask questions about assignments, explain why their child was absent, and other classroom business. Most of the parents were respectful to reach out at reasonable hours, however some had begun calling him after dinner when he was trying to spend time with his family. He told his wife that he feels overwhelmed and does not know how to make the calls stop. His wife suggests he talks to his principal about a plan to set boundaries with the parents, but he is nervous that his principal will be critical of his decision to give out his phone number.
