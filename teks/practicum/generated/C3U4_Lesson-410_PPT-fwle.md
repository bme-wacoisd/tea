## Slide 2

### TEKS Standards & Objectives

- TEKS 4E, 6A
- The student will…
- Define remediation and acceleration as they relate to mathematics instruction
- Define just-in-time interventions and describe their purpose in acceleration
- Compare the results of remediation and acceleration.

## Slide 3

### Bellringer

- John entered the second grade without having mastered all the first-grade math content standards. His second-grade teacher, noticing this same challenge for many students, spent much of the first few months providing remediation around first grade content before moving onto second grade math concepts. John was able to learn some of these first-grade concepts, but his teacher had to move quickly to address nearly 1.5 years of content in one school year. Unfortunately, he finished second grade with gaps in both first and second grade content.
- Now he is entering third grade and his teacher saw similar challenges for many students in a pre-assessment to start the school year. What will happen if his third-grade teacher begins the year the same way his second-grade teacher did? Why?

## Slide 4

### Vocabulary

- 4

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Remediation | Teaching content again to students who didn't learn it the first time; filling in gaps |
| Acceleration | Ensuring that students are taught grade-level content with supports to address past concepts or skills that students have not mastered. |
| Just-in-Time Supports | Strategic and timely review or reteaching of foundational skills that contribute to success on grade-level content. |

## Slide 5

### Notes: Acceleration and Just-in-Time Supports


|  |  | 4th-grade content |  |  | 5th grade content |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- The rest of the 5th-grade content
- Students never catch up on all grade level content.

| Traditional Remediation Approach |  |

| Acceleration Approach: Just-in-Time Interventions |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

- Students receive instruction in all grade level content, with strategic supports provided along the way to ensure they have the foundational knowledge to access the material.

## Slide 6

### Notes: Contrasting Remediation and Acceleration

- 6

| Remediation | Acceleration |
| --- | --- |
| Is often built on a deficit mindset. Can limit student access to grade-level instruction. Often focuses on drilling students on individual skills that might not be relevant to grade-level content. Based on the assumption that students can’t learn new math skills if they haven’t mastered every other prior skill. | Sets high expectations by ensuring all students are still engaged with grade-level content. Aligns review of foundational skills with grade-level content. Is provided right when a student will need it (just-in-time.) |

## Slide 7

### Notes: Just-In-Time Interventions—Ms. C


| Just in Time Intervention started two weeks prior to the launch of new units and occurred during the last two weeks of her current unit. |  |  |  | The 30 minutes before a grade-level lesson is dedicated to Just in Time Intervention teaching and testing. |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Last two weeks of current unit (ex. Measurement) |  | Upcoming Unit (Ex: Time)Student ready for grade level content. |  | 9:00 - 9:30am | Just In Time Intervention with small group. (Non-participating students engaged in extension activity) |
| Week 1 | Week 2 |  |  | 9:30 - 10:30am | Whole group, grade-level content focused lesson with exit ticket. |
| Administer pre-test for upcoming unit Analyze Data Plan interventions | Teach intervention lessons  Reassess to measure impact |  |  |  |  |

## Slide 9

### Practice Scenario: Identifying Remediation vs Acceleration

- 9
- Scenario 1: Mr. M and Ms. G both teach 8th grade math. As part of their professional learning community (PLC) they use common assessments to measure their student’s mastery of the 8th grade TEKS. Therefore, they can compare their results to determine what teaching practices are most effective.
- Ms. G used her pre-test data to identify the foundational math skills that students have not yet mastered and has designed a four-week “math bootcamp” at the beginning of the school year help students catch up on the concepts they need to succeed in the 8th grade curriculum.
- Mr. M used his pre-test data to identify the areas where his students have gaps in foundational content knowledge and has designed small group interventions for select students the week prior to introducing a new concept. He addresses these skills with the students that need it most, making direct connections to the grade level content they will learn the following week.

## Slide 10

### Practice: Identifying Remediation vs Acceleration

- 10
- Scenario 1:
- Which teacher is using acceleration? Which is using remediation?
- What do you think they will see in their common assessment data (And the 8th grade STAAR test) when they compare their results?

## Slide 11

### Practice: Identifying Remediation vs Acceleration

- Scenario 2: Ms. V and Ms. P both teach 4th grade math. Below are their students’ results on this year’s STAAR test, broken down by Unit.

| Percent of Students Proficient on the 4th grade STAAR Test |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | Ms. V’s Class | Ms. P’s Class |
| Unit 1: Place Value, Rounding, and Algorithms for Addition and Subtraction | 84% | 86% |
| Unit 2: Unit Conversions and Problem Solving with Metric Measurement | 72% | 71% |
| Unit 3: Multi-Digit Multiplication and Division | 78% | 76% |
| Unit 4: Angle Measure and Plane Figures | 79% | 81% |
| Unit 5: Fraction Equivalence, Ordering, and Operations | 70% | 64% |
| Unit 6: Decimal Fractions and Financial Literacy | 73% | 60% |
| Unit 7: Exploring Measurement with Multiplication and Data | 72% | 56% |

## Slide 13

### Debrief: RBIS Math Intervention Portfolio Project

- As part of your portfolio, you will be asked to plan and, if possible, implement, a just-in-time intervention in your internship classroom. This will require you work with your cooperating teacher to
- Identify skills or knowledge that students need support with to master upcoming grade level math content.
- Select students for this intervention
- Plan and implement a brief small group session that provides just-in-time support.
- If you are unable to do this in your cooperating teacher’s classroom, you will receive a sample scenario to use to plan a small group math intervention and include it as part of your portfolio.

## Slide 14

### Exit Ticket

- Explain the difference between remediation and acceleration, including how they can lead to different results for students.
- How do just-in-time interventions support students in accessing grade level content?
