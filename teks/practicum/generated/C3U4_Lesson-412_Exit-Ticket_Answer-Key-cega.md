Name:
Date:

Match the teacher mindset with the common pitfalls in math instruction.

- Select one of the teacher comments from the table above and explain why the pitfall they are expressing can negative impact student success. Then, provide an alternative for how they can still address these needs while providing grade-level instruction.

Responses will vary.

| __B__ | Too Much Remediation | “Students did not quite master the previous lesson. If I reteach that lesson and provide more at-bats, students will achieve mastery and then we can move on." |
| --- | --- | --- |
| __D__ | Procedural Instruction | “I can’t teach this third-grade lesson until I know my students have mastered all of the second-grade content.” |
| __C__ | Prioritizing Fluency Practice | Students do not know their math facts yet, so they are not ready for this grade-level instruction. We need to get caught up on math facts so we can prevent mistakes and get to grade level content. |
| __A__ | Repeating the First Teach | I do not have enough time to teach conceptually. I need to model the quickest, easiest way to complete the problem so we can get through the content. |
