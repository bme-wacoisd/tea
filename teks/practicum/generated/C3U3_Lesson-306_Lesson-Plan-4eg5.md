| Rationale/ Summary | All students need regular practice with grade-level, complex texts, and academic language to work with new language, knowledge, and ways of thinking. To give all students access to challenging texts, teachers often need to provide scaffolding and support. In this lesson, students will define tier one instruction and determine supports and scaffolding teachers can provide to help all students access grade-level complex texts during tier one instruction. Students will analyze a lesson plan to find specific supports and scaffolding that can help students engage with grade-level complex texts. | All students need regular practice with grade-level, complex texts, and academic language to work with new language, knowledge, and ways of thinking.

| 3 mins | Bellringer:  A 4th grade teacher is planning for their next unit from high-quality instructional curriculum, but they are concerned that the text complexity is too advanced for many of their students who are struggling readers. The teacher decides to find an alternative text on a lower reading level that they feel might be more appropriate and engaging for their students. How will this decision impact their students? | Student Guide |
| 2 mins | Debrief:  T: How will this decision impact their students?  S: Student responses may vary but could include that this will be beneficial for struggling readers because they might check out from a rigorous text. Using more engaging texts is better. The teacher meets students where they are, which is a good thing.  T: Although it may seem that using a lower-level text would be more appropriate and engaging, using a less complex text would have a negative impact on all students. If all students are reading at a lower level, then higher-level students are not being challenged or pushed to grow and lower-level students are not given access to grade-level complex texts and vocabulary to help them think critically and grow in their skills. | Student Guide |
| 8 mins | Notes: Text Complexity T: Today, we are going to discuss Complex Texts in a Tier 1 instruction. First, we need to define Tier 1 instruction. Please refer to the vocabulary section in your Student Guide.  S: (Write in vocabulary section of Student Guide.)  T: (Project with PowerPoint.) Tier 1 Instruction is high-quality classroom-wide instruction and support for all students focused on essential grade-level skills and concepts. T: In Tier 1 Instruction, all students access the same information and are exposed to grade-level content and vocabulary.  T: Let us look at the criteria for Tier 1 Instruction. Find the Tier 1 Instruction list under the vocabulary in your student guide.   T: What do you notice about the criteria for complex texts in Tier 1 instruction? Write down a few comments in the box next to the table.   S: (Write down responses.)  T: Would anyone like to share? S: The words I wrote down include heavy support, all students read the same text, exposes students to higher level content, gives all students access.  T: Wonderful. Tier 1 instruction provides all students access to the grade-level complex texts. T: Why do you think all students should engage with complex texts?  S: It will help challenge them and provide more difficult vocabulary. T: All students should engage with complex texts because it helps students grow their vocabulary, knowledge, and oral language skills. They can also develop the skills to access complex text independently. T: How might a teacher help struggling readers engage in grade-level complex texts? S: Maybe provide them with more support or guidance. Read the text aloud. T: Struggling readers will likely need heavy support and scaffolding from the teacher to access the grade-level text. These supports could include pre-teaching vocabulary, providing background information, annotating the text, and graphic organizers. Often, instead of providing these supports, teachers will give students lower-level texts. Providing support and scaffolding does not mean we provide lower-level readers with easier texts. It means we provide them with the support they need to access the grade-level text. | Student Guide PPT |
| 5 mins | Practice: The Impact on Vocabulary T: Let us look at an example of how using lower-level texts can have a negative impact on students’ ability to grow their vocabulary, knowledge, and oral language skills.  T: A 5th grade teacher plans to have her students read an article about an owl that was stuck in the Rockefeller Center’s Christmas tree. Knowing she has students on various reading levels, she decides to use leveled texts. All her students will read and learn about the Rockefeller Christmas tree owl, but the texts will be modified to different reading levels. The students reading on grade level will receive the text on a 5th grade level. Students who are just below grade level will receive the text on a 4th grade level. Students who are significantly below grade level will read the text on a 3rd grade level.   T: Let us look at the articles the teacher plans to give her students. Find the section in your student guide that says “Practice: The Impact on Vocabulary.” You will see links for three leveled texts.   S: (Locate articles.)  T: With a partner, I want you to take about 10 minutes to scan the texts at the three different levels. As you scan, take notes in your student guide about what you notice about the text at each level. For example, how does the vocabulary change at each level? How does the language change at each level? How does that impact the meaning of the text?  T: Are there any questions?  S: (Ask questions as needed.)  T: You may begin.  T: (After 10 minutes). What did you notice about the differences in the texts at each level?  S: Student responses will vary but may include the 3rd grade text was much shorter and did not have as many challenging vocabulary words as the grade level text. The sentences in the lower-level texts seemed easier.   T: What did you notice about the vocabulary and the language in each level?  S: The 3rd grade text had easier words and did not’ provide a lot of challenging vocabulary. The sentences in the lower-level texts were basic. The story line was not as deep in the lower-texts and did not provide as much detail.   T: (Share via PPT.) Let us look at a chart to compare the vocabulary in each of the texts.   T: How does the vocabulary and language change in each level?  S: The on-grade level text included more challenging vocabulary words than the other texts. The only common word in the list is raptor.   T: What impact do you think this has on students’ vocabulary development and comprehension skills?  S: Students are not going to have the opportunity to grow their vocabulary or knowledge about the topic which is going to make it harder to understand the text.   T: Right – by only providing lower-level texts to struggling readers, a teacher limits the student’s access and exposure to rich vocabulary, language, and knowledge that will help build their comprehension skills. This makes it even more difficult for them to catch up and develop the skills necessary to access complex text independently. | Student Guide PPT Owl Texts |
| 8 mins | Scaffolding and Support for Tier 1 Instruction T: The question now is, how do we engage all students in complex texts? What support and scaffolding can teachers provide to help students access the grade-level text? T: To help students access grade-level complex texts, teachers can: Pre-teach unfamiliar vocabulary and concepts. Provide necessary background knowledge. Use Text Sets (multiple texts on the same topic) Use graphic organizers. Read complex texts aloud to students.  T: Why do you think it is important to pre-teach unfamiliar vocabular and concepts and to provide background knowledge on the topic prior to reading?  S: It will help the students better understand what the text is going to be about.   T: How can using multiple texts on the same topic be used as a scaffold to support students?  S: It can build critical knowledge and vocabulary students need to aide in comprehension.  T: Right – teachers can use multiple texts that build in difficulty to help students build background knowledge and vocabulary for the more complex texts. Text sets can include videos, read aloud texts, infographics, photographs, or a less complex text that are used as precursors to the grade-level complex text. |  |
| 12 mins | Practice: Lesson Analysis  T: We are going to look at a Grade 4 lesson plan to see how the lesson is structured to provide the necessary support and scaffolding for all students. Remember that to help students access grade-level complex texts, teachers can: Pre-teach unfamiliar vocabulary and concepts. Provide necessary background knowledge. Use Text Sets (multiple texts on the same topic) Use graphic organizers. Read complex texts aloud to students.  T: Let us review the first part of the lesson together to see the supports and scaffolding the lesson plan offers.   T: Find “Practice: Lesson Analysis” in your student guide and click on the link for Grade 4, Unit 9, Lesson 1.   T: Let us look at the different parts of this lesson plan together. The first two pages provide an overview of the lesson. On page 8, you will see advance preparation notes on things the teacher needs to prepare prior to the lesson. On page 10, you will see ways the teacher can provide universal access to all students and core vocabulary for the lesson. Starting on page 11, you will see the actual lesson plan for the lesson. Are there any questions about the different parts of the lesson plan?  S: (ask questions as needed.)  T: In just a moment, you are going to work with a partner to look for potential scaffolding and support provided in the lesson plan to help support all students in accessing the grade-level text. First, I want to model what this will look like.  T: I am going to start reading the Advance Preparation section of the lesson plan. On page 9 of the lesson plan, I see that students will have a Character Development Notes graphic organizer to record notes throughout the unit. This is one way a teacher can help support readers in accessing complex texts. It allows students to organize their thoughts.  T: On that same page under the writing section, I see that the teacher is instructed to provide examples of texts written in the first-person point of view as a model or example for students. This provides students with a visual representation, which is helpful for struggling readers and ELL students.   T: Students are also provided sentence frames to support their writing. This helps support students in getting started with their thinking.   T: These are all examples of ways teachers can support students in accessing complex texts.  T: Now, I want you to work with a partner to review the rest of the lesson plan and find additional ways teachers can provide scaffolding and support to assist students in accessing the grade-level complex texts.   T: Are there any questions?  S: (ask questions as needed)  T: You will have about 10 minutes. You may begin.  S: (complete activity.) | Student Guide Grade 4, Unit 9, Lesson 1 |
| 2 mins | Debrief   T: What additional scaffolding did you find in the lesson plan? S: Pre-teaching vocabulary, activating background knowledge through think-pair-share, modeling, small groups. T: Why is it important to provide all students access to grade-level complex texts? S: Students need regular practice with grade-level, complex texts, and academic language to work with new language, knowledge, and ways of thinking. T: How can teachers support students in accessing grade-level complex texts when they are not reading on grade-level? S: The teacher can provide support and scaffolding by re-teaching unfamiliar vocabulary and concepts, providing necessary background knowledge, using Text Sets (multiple texts on the same topic), and using graphic organizers. |  |
