## Field-Based Experience: Practicum Teacher

### Tool Name: Classroom Layout

Name:
Date:
Objectives:
- Identify components of a well-designed classroom
- Describe how the physical layout of a classroom contributes to a safe and effective learning environment.
- Evaluate classroom designs for effectiveness.
- Design a classroom layout that allows for smooth transitions, whole group discussion, small group work, and access to materials.

Purpose:  The purpose of this tool is for students to identify the components of a well-designed classroom:  safe and effective learning environment, smooth transitions, whole group discussion, small group work, and access to materials.
Summary:  The tool provides a section for students to record their observations about classroom layout, with sections for evidence of smooth transitions, whole group discussion, small group work, and access to materials. It also provides students the opportunity to apply their knowledge about effective classroom design through discussion with the field site campus teacher and by revising or creating a classroom layout section of a classroom management plan. Lastly, the tool prompts students to reflect upon the impact of classroom layout on the field site campus teacher’s ability to implement instruction.
