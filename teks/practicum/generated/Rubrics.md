### Tool Name: Rubrics

Date:
Objectives:
- Define rubric and explain the purpose of a rubric for both students and teachers.
- Identify and analyze the qualities of an effective rubric.
Purpose: The purpose of this tool is for students to make field notes about rubric quality, design a rubric and/or calibrate rubric scoring, and create a list of unreliable, but commonly used rubric descriptions.
Summary: The first task of this tool asks students to study a rubric that is being used in the classroom and make field notes about the quality characteristics: list specific criteria, focus on the most important content, have clearly defined and measurable levels of performance, and be reliable (meaning it is sufficiently descriptive that various raters would identify the same or similar score). The application task invites students to develop a rubric and request feedback from the field site campus teacher and deploy the rubric in class, if appropriate. Alternately, students may wish to score rubrics that are currently being used to investigate reliability. Lastly, students may reflect upon commonly used rubric descriptions that lead to issues with reliability.
Connections to Instructional Practices:
Lesson 5.13: Introduction to Rubrics
Connected Instructional Practice TEKS:
- Standard 8: The student assesses teaching and learning. The student is expected to: (A) describe the role of assessment as part of the learning process; (C) analyze the assessment process; and (D) use appropriate assessment strategies in an instructional setting.
Connected Practicum TEKS:
- Standard 6:  The student plans and uses effective instruction. The student is expected to: (A) apply principles and theories that impact instructional planning.
- Standard 13:  The student continues to participate in field-based experiences in education or training. The student is expected to: (A) apply instructional strategies and concepts within a local educational or training facility; (B) document, assess, and reflect on instructional experiences.

Observe: Teachers use rubrics to gauge student performance against a predefined set of success criteria for a task. Study a rubric that has been used or will be used with a student assignment and use the space below to record your observations about the rubric’s characteristics of quality. Quality rubrics should: list specific criteria, focus on the most important content, have clearly defined and measurable levels of performance, and be reliable (meaning it is sufficiently descriptive that various raters would identify the same or similar score).
