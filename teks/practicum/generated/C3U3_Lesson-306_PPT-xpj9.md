### Bellringer

- A 4th grade teacher is planning for their next unit from high-quality instructional curriculum, but they are concerned that the text complexity is too advanced for many of their students who are struggling readers. The teacher decides to find an alternative text on a lower reading level that they feel might be more appropriate and engaging for their students. How will this decision impact their students?
