| Rationale/ Summary | Sustainability is an important part to any profession and teaching is no different. Jobs often can present stressors, that if not addressed or managed properly, that can eventually lead to burnout. Burnout impacts an individual’s job performance and can even lead to decisions to leave a profession all together. Teacher burnout is a reality for all educators and can be caused by myriad stressors. Stressors, however, can be managed and symptoms of burnout can be identified to help prevent teacher burnout. In this lesson, students will explore the unique challenges of the teaching profession, describe what teacher burnout is and what stressors may cause it, and identify the warning signs of teacher burnout. Sustainability in the teaching profession is not only important to student outcomes, but to teacher growth. | Sustainability is an important part to any profession and teaching is no different.

| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Burnout is a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion.  Burnout is unique to teachers and only happens because of the unique stressors teachers face.  Burnout can cause teachers to feel detached, ineffective, cynical, and unaccomplished.  Stressors that can cause burnout include school organization, job demands, work resources, and teacher social and emotional competences.  Warning signs of burnout are feeling tired and unhappy for a short period of time.   Which of the following is not a warning sign of burning out? Exhaustion, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping.  Feeling depressed and withdrawn from others.  Frustrated after a class behaves poorly.  Physical symptoms like headaches, stomachaches, racing heart.   2.   How do stressors contribute to the higher rate of teacher burnout? Why is it important to manage the stressors that contribute to teacher burnout?  See Exit Ticket Answer Key for exemplar responses. | Burnout is a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion.

| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Work with a group or partner to brainstorm a list of sources of teacher stress. | Student Guide |
| 4 mins | Debrief: T: As a whole class, sort the items in the list into the four categories of teacher stress (Project on board):   1. School Organizations that lack strong principal leadership, a healthy school climate and a collegial, supportive environment.   2. Job Demands that are escalating with high-stakes testing, student behavioral problems, and difficult parents.    3. Work Resources that limit a teacher’s sense of autonomy and decision-making power.   4. Teacher Social and Emotional Competence to manage stress and nurture a healthy classroom. S: (Sort their examples into the chart in Student Guide.) T: Teachers face significant and unique stressors related to their work.  If chronic stress is not managed, it can lead to burnout. Chronic burnout can lead to serious health problems including depression. | Student Guide PPT |
| 6 mins | Notes: Teacher Burnout T: Today we are going to talk about similar stress or emotions related to teaching. All professions, including teaching, can cause short-term and long-term stress. This stress can eventually turn to burnout. Burnout is a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, detachment, and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.   T: (Project definition of burnout with PowerPoint.)  S: (Write definition in Student Guide.)  T: Empathy fatigue is a condition where an individual experiences emotional and physical exhaustion, leading to a decreased ability to empathize or feel compassion for others.  S: (Write definition in Student Guide.)  T: It is important to address because it impacts job sustainability. Teachers can feel burnout, also.  We will take some more specific notes about teacher burnout to better understand what it is, its signs and effects. In the next lesson, we will learn about how to prevent teacher burnout. Refer to your notes in your Student Guide.  T: What are challenges or stressors faced by educators?  S:   1. School Organizations that lack strong principal leadership, a healthy school climate and a collegial, supportive environment.   2. Job Demands that are escalating with high-stakes testing, student behavioral problems, and difficult parents.    3. Work Resources that limit a teacher’s sense of autonomy and decision-making power.     4. Teacher Social and Emotional Competence to manage stress and nurture a healthy classroom.   T: How do stressors contribute to teacher burnout?  S: Teachers feel like they don’t have enough resources (physical, emotional, mental) to address the needs which can lead to burnout.   T: What are some warning signs of teacher burnout?  S: Exhaustion, depression, withdrawal, physical symptoms (headaches, stomachaches, racing heart, etc.), feeling cynical toward the job.   T: Why is teacher burnout concerning?  S: Teacher burnout is concerning because it impacts the way a teacher does their job and influences decisions to remain in the profession. | Student Guide PPT |
| 10 mins | Video Viewing: What is Teacher Burnout? T: Today we are going to watch a video called “Stress and Teacher Burnout” created by PBS. We are going to discuss what is teacher burnout in this lesson, and ways to identify it. You have guided questions in your Student Guide. Please review them quickly.   S: (Review questions.)  T: (Start video at 00:29).   S: (Watch video and answer questions.)  T:  What are some contextual factors that can cause stress to a teacher?  S: Demands of change or to fix something, improving test scores, implementing new curriculum, changes out of their control, community context or environmental factors, young peoples’ lives.   T: What is empathy distress or empathy fatigue in your own words? (Hint: Opposite of compassion and what too much empathy can do.)   S: When you are always feeling empathy for someone, you can get tired of it and get stuck in it. And it makes it hard to do other things. It is the opposite of compassion.   T: What is short-term stress? What is long-term stress?  S: Short-term stress is when you are overwhelmed with sadness or the lack of efficacy to do anything for a moment. Long-term stress is debilitating, and people lose the capacity to observe themselves. They may be objective with reality and see problems that don’t exist. Coping when you are stuck is very hard. People focus on the past and become angry and look to the future to “get out.”  T: How does burnout happen? Does it happen right away?  S: Burnout does not happen right away because it comes from long-term stress. It is a psychological and physiological state that can lead to depression.   T: Why are good teachers able to burnout?  S: Because all the things that make someone a good teacher – juggling different tasks and being empathetic – are also the things that make people burnout. | Student Guide Video: Understanding Stress and Burnout |
| 10 mins | Small Group Discussion: Teacher Burnout T: Independently read the article, Teacher Burnout: Causes, Symptoms, and Prevention. In small groups, using your notes, the article, and the teacher video, you will discuss the causes, symptoms and difficulties related to teacher burnout. In your Student Guide, you will find a few questions to get you started. These are meant to encourage you to think and ask additional questions.  T: Please move into your groups.  S: (Move into groups.)  T: We will briefly review norms for group conversations:  Be respectful while others are speaking Listen actively  Allow everyone the opportunity to speak You have space under your questions to take notes if you would like. We will review your responses in the debrief.  Are there any questions about the activity? (Answer any clarifying questions.)  T: You will have 10 minutes, please begin.  S: (Begin reading article. Engage in group discussion.) T: (Circulate and monitor conversations. Support students and redirect when necessary.) T: Students, your time is up. We will review your conversations. | Student Guide Teacher Burnout: Causes, Symptoms, and Prevention. |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: What is teacher burnout? How is it different than short-term stress?  S: Burnout is a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, detachment, and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.  This is a result of prolonged exposure to stress related to the job of an educator. It is different from short-term stress because short-term stress can happen only for a moment – like being sad for just a moment. Teacher burnout does not go away.   T: What are some stressors or contextual factors that can cause burnout? Why do you think these would cause burnout over a long period of time? (Hint: Video)  S: 1. School Organizations that lack strong principal leadership, a healthy school climate and a collegial, supportive environment. 2. Job Demands that are escalating with high-stakes testing, student behavioral problems, and difficult parents.  3. Work Resources that limit a teacher’s sense of autonomy and decision-making power.   4. Teacher Social and Emotional Competence to manage stress and nurture a healthy classroom.   T: What are the symptoms of burnout? Why is it important to recognize them?  S: Symptoms include physical response, depression, withdrawal, cynicism about the job. It is important to recognize them to prevent them.   T: Why should we prevent teacher burnout? How does teacher burnout affect students and the wider school?  S: We don’t want teacher to leave teaching because teachers who come into teaching love it. We also need teachers in the classroom. It affects students and the wider school because if teachers are feeling burn out, they are not teaching to the best of their ability and may stop caring about students. This could mean a lot of things for students.   T: You have a homework assignment to be used during class on (FILL IN DUE DATE—Lesson 2.16). You will need to conduct a brief interview with a current teacher about stress and stress management. Use the questions in your Student Guide to guide the conversation. | Student Guide |
