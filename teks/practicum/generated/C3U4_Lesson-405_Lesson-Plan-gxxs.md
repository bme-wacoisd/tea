| Rationale/ Summary | Productive struggle, also called effortful learning, is the process of providing a learner with an opportunity to struggle with a developmentally appropriate concept that might be new or challenging and encouraging, to find a solution. This practice, while challenging for teachers as well as students, gives students the chance to think outside of the box and encourages creative problem-solving strategies. In this lesson, students will discuss productive struggle and how challenges can increase opportunities for learning. | Productive struggle, also called effortful learning, is the process of providing a learner with an opportunity to struggle with a developmentally appropriate concept that might be new or challenging and encouraging, to find a solution.

|  |  |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer: Think about your own experiences learning mathematics. Reflect on a concept that you have a hard time understanding at first, but eventually understood? | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 5 mins | Partner Activity: Delivery Dilemma  T: (Use the PPT to display the Delivery Dilemma scenario.)  T: Would someone read the scenario on the board?  S: The T-Shirt Company shipped t-shirts to ABC Elementary School. The T-Shirt Company can fit 10 small boxes or 8 large boxes into a carton. A total of 96 boxes were sent. There were fewer small boxes sent than large boxes. What is the total number of cartons the ABC Elementary will receive?   T: You may work by yourself or with a partner. You have five minutes to find a solution to this problem. | Student Guide PowerPoint |
| 15 mins | Notes: Productive Struggle T: Let us talk about the delivery dilemma. What solutions did you come up with? S: (Share out answers.) T: (Engage students in dialogue about how they came to their answers. Strategies to arrive to the correct answer may vary. Ask students to work out their thinking on the board, explain orally, or draw pictures.) T: How did you feel completing this problem? S: (Answers will vary, but may include: anxious, excited, the problem was too easy, the problem was too hard, pressured for time, etc.) T: What is something you noticed about how your classmates came to find their answer? S: There were many different strategies used in the different groups. T: Great. Today we are going to discuss a concept called productive struggle. Will a volunteer please read the definition of productive struggle? S: The  process of providing a learner with an opportunity to struggle with a developmentally appropriate concept that might be new or challenging and encouraging, to find a solution. T: Thank you. How was the activity you just completed an example of a productive struggle? S: Some of us struggled to get to the correct answer in the time allotted.  T: Do you feel the question was developmentally appropriate? S: Yes.  T: Did you feel that you had the knowledge to answer the question—even if you felt like you needed more time? S: Yes.  T: This is an example of productive struggle. Students benefit greatly from being exposed to new or challenging math problems and then being given the opportunity to work through the problems through methods that make sense to them. T: When students are willing to participate in productive struggle, it is often because they have a growth mindset. Will a volunteer please read the definition for growth mindset? S: The belief that struggling with tasks or skills creates opportunities for new learning and improvement over time. T: People who have a growth mindset believe that with time, practice, and by productively struggling, they can improve upon desired skills or learning goals. Can anyone think of a skill they had to have a growth mindset to achieve? S: (Answers will vary.) T: A growth mindset is different than a fixed mindset. Will a volunteer please read the definition of fixed mindset for the class? S: The belief that ability (intelligence, talent, etc.) are inherent, or unable to be changed regardless of time spent on the skill/task. T: A fixed mindset is how we describe individuals who believe that their input does not make a difference in the outcome of a goal. Here is an example. Student A never studies for his math tests because he says he “isn’t any good at math,” so therefore studying is “pointless.” Because he does not study, he does not do well on his tests. T: How do you know Student A has a fixed mindset? S: Student A believes he is bad at math, so he will not struggle to try something new. T: Why is a fixed mindset dangerous for students when learning a new skill? T: Because students with a fixed mindset will be more likely to give up and less likely to persevere through challenging content.  T: We are going to watch a video about productive struggle. In your Student Guide, make notes about what you notice, as well as questions you might have about the process of productive struggle as it applies to a mathematics classroom.   T: (Show Productive Struggle Video.)  S: (Take notes in Student Guide.)  T: What stood out to you in this video?  S: (Answers will vary.)  T: There are a few rules that we should discuss when considering the Do’s and Don’ts of Productive Struggle. (Use the PPT to go over the Do’s and Don’ts of productive struggle. Encourage students to provide their own ideas of rules.)  T: Before we move into our final activity of the day, let us look at an example and a non-example of how to appropriately use Productive Struggle.   T: (Ask student to read the example and non-example from their PowerPoint.) | Student Guide PowerPoint Productive Struggle Video |
| 10 mins | Discussion: Productive Struggle Experiences  T: Return to your bellringer from the beginning of this class.   T: In triads (groups of three), you will each share the experience that you wrote about during our bellringer. You will describe the concept you struggled with learning. What did it feel like to struggle? What did you do to overcome the struggle? How do you feel about that concept now?  T: Once each group member can share, use your poster paper to write down the similarities and differences in your experiences. We will do a gallery walk when time is up.  S: (Share out with group mates and document their experiences on their poster paper.) | Student Guide PowerPoint Poster Paper/Large Sticky Notes Markers |
| 5 mins | Debrief  T: Quietly take two minutes to walk around the classroom and look at the other group’s posters. You do not have to take notes on them but be prepared to discuss what you see.  S: (Gallery walk for two minutes.)  T: What were some common themes you saw in terms of overcoming academic struggle?  S: (Answers will vary, but should include) Perseverance, trying to understand the content in a different way or by a different method.  T: There is power in perseverance in the face of the challenge of new learning. Every student will run into challenging content that they do not understand at first. The teacher’s role is to help guide students through their challenges and move them through the process, but they cannot do the learning for the student. That is why it is important that teachers create an environment where growth mindsets and productive struggle are encouraged. (Note: This is a good opportunity for the teacher to model selective vulnerability by sharing a story of their own experiences in not understanding a concept or skill.)  T: What might be the downside of not letting students struggle and always intervening?  S: The student may never learn to understand the concept, or they might never learn to work through the challenge individually.  T: Right—and as you move further and further through your educational career and into adulthood, you will be called on to oversee your own learning and growth. Building the skills of productive struggle in the face of a new problem is a deeply valuable academic and life skill that teachers need to give students time and space to practice. | Student Guide |
