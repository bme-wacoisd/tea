| Formative Assessment and Exemplar Response | Indicate if the statements below are true or false in describing the qualities of effective schools.  Effective schools have a clear vision for what schools should do to ensure an excellent education for all Texas students.  Effective instruction plays only a small role in what ensures that schools are effective.  2.  Select all that apply that describe the qualities of effective schools.  Teachers are supported and that recruitment, retention and high-quality teacher induction are a priority.  Professional development is provided to teachers that is job embedded.  There is a focus on continuous improvement through school improvement that address causes of low performance. All of the above.

|  | During this lesson, students will need to access the Texas Effective Schools Framework and explore the five levers in more depth. Plan for how students will access the framework and information on the levers, either by accessing them online or reviewing printed copies. |  |
| 5 mins | Bellringer:  Based on your experiences as a student and what you have learned in this and other Education & Training courses, what are the three most important characteristics of effective schools? Provide your reasoning. | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Notes: Introduction to Texas Effective Schools Framework T: Let us do a brief share-out of the characteristics you wrote in your response to the bellringer. We will share responses “popcorn-style.” Just share one of your characteristics aloud; you do not need to raise your hand. Please only share the characteristic, not also the rationale.  S: Answers may vary but may include: Effective teacher A safe school environment Focused on families. Supportive of all students   T: There are many elements of schools that determine the quality of education provided to students. We are fortunate that, in Texas, there is a framework that summarizes the key ideas. It is called the Texas Effective Schools Framework. It is a clear vision for what schools need to do to provide all students in Texas with a high-quality education.  S: (Add description to graphic organizer in Student Guide.)  T: There are five levers in the framework. Let us set aside education and consider a machine or other piece of equipment for a moment. What is a lever?  S: It is a part of a machine that makes something happen when you pull it.  T: If we apply that general idea to the Effective Schools Framework, levers in the framework are the things that schools need to do to be effective. There are five levers: Strong school leadership and planning Strategic staffing Positive school culture High-quality instructional materials and assessments Effective instruction  S: (Fill in levers in graphic organizer in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 15 mins | Research: Levers of Texas Effective Schools Framework  T: Now, you will have an opportunity to dig into one of the levers in more depth. We will examine one lever together, and then we will divide into four groups. I will then assign one of the remaining levers to each group.  T: We are going to look at Strong School Leadership and Planning together. Fill in the blank in your Student Guide with the name of this lever.  S: (Complete blank in Student Guide.)  T: Let us now look at the webpage for this lever together.  T: (Display https://texasesf.org/framework/prioritized-lever-1/ for the class).  T: Where do you see the definition for this lever?  S: Right under the name of the lever.  T: Add the definition to your Student Guide.  S: (Add definition to Student Guide.)  T: Where do you see some examples of what a district can to do support effective schools with this lever?  S: Under the “District Commitments” header.  T: All of these are possible examples. Add two to your Student Guide.   S: (Add examples to Student Guide.)  T: Where do you see examples of what a school can do to address this lever?  S: Under “Essential Actions.”  T: These are all possible examples. Add two to your Student Guide.  T: Now, you are ready to begin your research in groups.  T: Before you begin your research, select someone in your team to serve as a spokesperson. You will review some specific information about the lever assigned to you and fill out the Research section of your Student Guide. When we come back together as a class, your spokesperson will share information about your lever with everyone.  T: (Use established classroom routine to divide students into five groups and assign a lever to each group.)  T: You will have 10 minutes for your research. Begin.  T: (Start 10-minute timer).  S: (Review additional information on assigned lever and complete section of Student Guide.)  T: (Circulate to monitor groups and help, as needed.) | Student Guide Webpage for Strong School Leadership and Planning Lever |
| 10 mins | Research Share: Levers of Texas Effective Schools Framework T: Let us come back together as a class. As I call out each lever, the spokesperson for that group should share your answer to the first question you answered.  T: (Call out each lever.)  S: (Spokesperson for each group shares the answer to the first question in the Research section of the Student Guide.)  S: Responses may vary but may include: Strategic staffing It means schools retain effective teachers by recruiting and selecting strong candidates and supporting them when they start teaching. High-quality instructional materials and assessments It means students learn with resources aligned to the TEKS and take assessments that align with the TEKS. Effective instruction It means teachers receive professional development as a regular part of their jobs and get the time to analyze data and tailor instruction to meet student needs. Positive school culture It means there is a clear school vision, mission, and goals; high expectations for student behavior; support for students; and engagement with families and the community.  S: (Complete graphic organizer in Student Guide.) | Student Guide |
| 5 mins | Debrief T: Can a volunteer please review the five levers in the Effective Schools Framework?  S: The levers are: Strong school leadership and planning Strategic staffing Positive school culture High-quality instructional materials and assessments Effective instruction  T: How many of these levers focus on what happens in a classroom when students are learning?  S: Two of them.  T: Which two?  S: High-quality instructional materials and assessments  T: Three of the five levers – more than half – are about creating a school environment in which students can learn effectively in the classroom. | Student Guide |
